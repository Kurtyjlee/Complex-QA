      "The actual launch of DeSantis\u2019s presidential campaign, in a \u201cTwitter Spaces\u201d event that crashed repeatedly and played to a smaller audience than he would have claimed just by showing up on Fox, instead offered the political version of the lesson that we\u2019ve been taught repeatedly by Musk\u2019s stewardship of Twitter: The internet can be a trap.",
      "For the Tesla and SpaceX mogul, the trap was sprung because Musk wanted to attack the groupthink of liberal institutions, and seeing that groupthink manifest on his favorite social media site, he imagined that owning Twitter was the key to transforming public discourse.",
      "But for all its influence, social media is still downstream of other institutions \u2014 universities, newspapers, television channels, movie studios, other internet platforms. Twitter is real life, but only through its relationship to other realities; it doesn\u2019t have the capacity to be a hub of discourse, news gathering or entertainment on its own.

Or he\u2019s encouraged his favored journalists to publish their scoops and essays on his site when it isn\u2019t yet built out for that kind of publication. Or he\u2019s encouraged media figures like Tucker Carlson and now politicians like DeSantis to run shows or do interviews on his platform, without having the infrastructure in place to make all that work.",
      "It\u2019s entirely possible that Musk can build out that infrastructure eventually, and make Twitter more capacious than it is today. But there isn\u2019t some immediate social-media shortcut to the influence he\u2019s seeking. If you want Twitter to be the world\u2019s news hub, you probably need a Twitter newsroom. If you want Twitter to host presidential candidates, you probably need a Twitter channel that feels like a professional newscast. And while you\u2019re trying to build those things, you need to be careful that the nature of social media doesn\u2019t diminish you to the kind of caricatured role \u2014 troll instead of tycoon \u2014 that tempts everyone on Twitter.",

There\u2019s an emerging criticism of the Florida governor that suggests that his whole persona is too online \u2014 that his talk about wokeness, wokeness, wokeness is pitched to a narrow and internet-based faction within the G.O.P., that he\u2019s setting himself to be like Elizabeth Warren in 2020, whose promise of plans, plans, plans thrilled the wonk faction but fell flat with normal Democratic voters.",
      "I think this critique is overdrawn. If you look at polling of Republican primary voters, the culture war appears to be a general concern rather than an elite fixation, and there\u2019s a plausible argument that the conflict with the new progressivism is the main thing binding the G.O.P. coalition together.",
      "But it does seem true that the conflict with progressivism in the context of social media is a more boutique taste, and that lots of anti-woke conservatives aren\u2019t particularly invested in whether the previous Twitter regime was throttling such-and-such right-wing influencer or taking orders from such-and-such \u201cdisinformation\u201d specialist. And it\u2019s also true that DeSantis is running against a candidate who, at any moment, can return to Twitter and bestride its feeds like a colossus, no matter whatever Republican alternative the \u201cchief twit\u201d might prefer.",

The Florida governor\u2019s best self-advertisement in a primary should be his promise to be more active in reality than Trump, with his claim to be better at actual governance made manifest through his advantage in flesh-pressing, campaign-trail-hitting energy.",
      "The good news for DeSantis is that he doesn\u2019t have billions invested in a social media company, so having endured a diminishing introduction, he can slip the trap and walk away \u2014 toward the crowds, klieg lights and the grass.",
