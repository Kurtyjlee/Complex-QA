      "ADIYAMAN, Turkey \u2014 Adiyaman is a southern province of Turkey that a lot of people miss on a map. Too small, too poor, too pious. Too Kurdish, yet not Kurdish enough. Its neighboring provinces carry the weight of history; Adiyaman is mostly known for its loose tobacco.",
      "In the 2014 presidential election, Recep Tayyip Erdogan won 69 percent of the vote in Adiyaman. In 2018, he won 67 percent there.",
      "The earthquakes that struck on Feb. 6 left more than 50,000 people in Turkey and Syria dead. More than 6,000 died in Adiyaman alone, where more than 1,200 buildings collapsed and thousands more were heavily damaged. In those first essential hours, the state was nowhere to be seen. Victims lay under the rubble waiting for rescue teams for days.",
      "That failure was supposed to jolt places like Adiyaman out of their long alliance with Mr. Erdogan. Heading into the election on Sunday, the opposition, led by Kemal Kilicdaroglu and the Republican People\u2019s Party, the C.H.P., expected a wave of protest votes.",
      "That election was one of the closest of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s career. Neither party managed to claim an outright majority in the first round, and a runoff is planned for May 28. If Mr. Erdogan is confident that he\u2019ll succeed in the second round, it might be because of places like Adiyaman, where he won 66 percent of the vote.",
      "For some voters in Ankara and Istanbul, it seemed as if people in the southern provinces blindly voted for a president and a party that abandoned them when their need was dire. The truth is more complicated.",
      "I spent a week in Adiyaman following the work of Oy ve Otesi (Vote and Beyond), a group that monitors elections, and talking to survivors of the earthquakes about this election. People in Adiyaman are getting by again, but things are fragile. Many lost their jobs and Turkey\u2019s hyperinflation has hit the region hard. But for now the government is paying attention. Families that were made homeless by the earthquakes are starting to settle into temporary housing. In one camp, container houses sent from Qatar overheat in the sun, but the road is freshly paved. A huge poster of Mr. Erdogan nearby promised free natural gas for a year. Mr. Kilicdaroglu pledged free housing for earthquake victims on another poster, but that one was a three-and-a-half-mile drive away.",
      "Zeynep, a mother of four children whose husband was in the army, told me that supplies from the disaster relief ministry and her husband\u2019s recent raise in wages, courtesy of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government, were what allowed her to feed her family. Zeynep asked me not to use her full name for her husband\u2019s sake. She favored Mr. Kilicdaroglu and the pro-Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party, the H.D.P. Her husband is in the special operation forces, fighting Kurdish insurgents. She wasn\u2019t going to vote in the first round. Maybe, she said, she\u2019d vote in the second.",
      "Sevgi, also a housewife, planned to vote but kept changing her mind. She didn\u2019t like Mr. Erdogan, at least not anymore, but she was afraid of what her family would do if they found out she voted for the C.H.P.: the party of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk and secularism; the party that once supported a ban against the head scarf in public institutions. Who knows, her family might say, what the C.H.P. would do next.",
      "On the other side of town, near the local university, Ekrem Abaci, a muhtar \u2014 a sort of neighborhood representative \u2014 ordered people around in his office. Men unloaded water jugs from the trucks that kept arriving. The disaster response ministry was sending daily deliveries of water that the muhtar could distribute among his constituency. He and the men around him all told me the same thing: Our government took care of us. It may have come late, but any country would have been the same in such a disaster. The government is not to blame.",
      "\u201cVote for Papa Tayyip tomorrow,\u201d the muhtar called out to Hakan, a graduate student with a broken arm who had come in to collect some papers. Hakan was quiet for a moment, then he told me I could restart the voice recorder that I\u2019d paused when he came in. He said that he\u2019d voted his whole life for Mr. Erdogan and his party, but he wouldn\u2019t this time. He\u2019d vote against the nepotism that has left so many graduates like him unemployed, and the bureaucratic rot that means he gets fined when he shouldn\u2019t and can\u2019t get access to benefits he\u2019s entitled to. Then he left.",
      "It\u2019s not that nothing in Adiyaman and neighboring provinces has changed: Many of the areas hit hardest by the earthquakes, which have historically supported Mr. Erdogan, shifted away from him in the first round.

      "Almost a year has passed since the Bureau of Economic Analysis announced that the U.S. economy had contracted for two quarters in a row. Some people believe, wrongly, that two quarters of falling G.D.P. is the official definition of a recession. Economic negativity ran rampant, especially but not only on the political right.",
      "The interesting question now is why, at least according to some surveys, the public remains very negative on the economy \u2014 as negative as it has been in the past amid severe economic downturns \u2014 even though those recession calls were clearly a false alarm, and the economy is actually looking remarkably strong. Or maybe the question should be why people say that they\u2019re very negative on the economy.",
      "This is a touchy subject, albeit one I\u2019ve commented on before. You don\u2019t want to say that Americans are stupid; you certainly don\u2019t want to sound like that John McCain adviser who insisted that America was a \u201cnation of whiners\u201d who were experiencing only a \u201cmental recession.\u201d",
      "On the other hand, there are now huge gaps between what people say about the economy and both what the data says and what they say about their own experience. And we have some new information on what lies behind these gaps.",
      "First, about that much-hyped \u201cBiden recession.\u201d The actual definition of a recession involves several economic indicators, and aside from those G.D.P. numbers, nothing that has happened to the economy looks remotely like a recession.",
      "Since December 2021 the U.S. economy has added almost six million jobs while the unemployment rate has fallen from 3.9 percent to 3.4 percent, a level not seen since the 1960s. And no, unemployment isn\u2019t low because Americans have dropped out of the labor force: The percentage of adults either working or looking for a job has declined, but that\u2019s almost entirely a result of an aging population, and labor force participation is right back in line with prepandemic projections.",
      "And these are good jobs, according to workers themselves. According to the Conference Board, which has been surveying job satisfaction since 1987, \u201cU.S. workers have never been more content.\u201d",
      "To be sure, the return of serious inflation after decades of quiescence rattled everyone, and not just because it reduced real incomes. (Real wages fell during Ronald Reagan\u2019s second term, but people felt pretty good about the economy anyway.) One benefit of low inflation is that it gives people one less thing to worry about; according to the American Psychological Association, inflation was a major source of stress during 2022.",
      "But inflation, while still elevated, has come way down. The inflation rate over the past six months was 3.3 percent, compared with 9.6 percent last June. The price of gasoline, a major political talking point last year, is now more or less normal compared with average earnings.",
      "And people have noticed. In October, 20 percent of Americans named inflation as the most important problem facing the nation; that\u2019s now down to 9 percent.",
      "So what\u2019s going on? The general rule seems to be that Americans are feeling good about their personal situation but believe that bad things are happening to other people. A Federal Reserve study found that in late 2021 a record-high percentage of Americans were positive about their own finances while a record low were positive about the economy. We don\u2019t have results for 2022 yet, but my guess is that they\u2019ll look similar.",
      "Partisanship surely explains much of this divergence. A newly published study shows that who holds the White House has huge effects on views of the economy; this is true for supporters of both parties, although the effect appears to be about twice as strong for Republicans. The study also finds, however, that these changes in reported views don\u2019t appear to have any effect on actual spending \u2014 that they reflect \u201ccheerleading,\u201d as opposed to \u201cactual expectations.\u201d",
      "Beyond that, there\u2019s good reason to believe that media reports about the economy have had a strongly negative bias. One thing that has gone really, really right in America lately is job creation, yet the public consistently reports having heard more negative than positive news about employment.",
      "And let\u2019s not let economists off the hook. As Mark Zandi of Moody\u2019s Analytics points out, many economists have been predicting recession month after month for the past year. Sooner or later, a recession will no doubt happen, but as he says, \u201cIn my 30-plus years as a professional economist, I\u2019ve never seen such recession pessimism,\u201d even as the economy has remained resilient.

The most recent innovation has been tamer: People have banged pots whenever the president has appeared. The cause? President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s measure raising the retirement age from 62 to 64.",
      "This might at first glance appear to be the work of a vibrant political left wing, fighting pro-business, anti-worker policies from a center-right technocratic government. Indeed, France\u2019s labor unions \u2014 though representing a smaller share of the work force than elsewhere in Western Europe \u2014 have been united in their opposition, making them a redoubtable force. Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, who leads the left-wing coalition NUPES, has been a central figure in the parliamentary fight against Mr. Macron, nearly bringing down his government with a no-confidence vote in March.",
      "And yet it is not France\u2019s left that has benefited from the popular rebellion. It is the far right.",
      "Recent polls showed that if last year\u2019s head-to-head presidential election were held now, Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right Rassemblement National, would beat Mr. Macron handily, 55 to 45 percent. Other polls that list all possible candidates have shown that Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, despite his and his group\u2019s support for the anti-Macron movement, has gained a mere percentage point since last year\u2019s elections, hovering at around a quarter of the votes and, in some scenarios, only 20 percent.",
      "In a situation that seems tailor-made for a resurgence of the left, how is it that, for the moment, at least, it is not just the right but the far right that has benefited?",
      "Hatred of the established order is no longer a marker of leftism, and France\u2019s recent history testifies to this. The Yellow Vests, France\u2019s last mass protest movement, which began in response to an eco-friendly hike in gas taxes in 2018, was a strange hodgepodge of positions and attitudes, and its political leanings varied from city to city and even differed from one roundabout to another where the protesters gathered.",
      "The movement rejected attempts by politicians to join them and very early developed a solid right-leaning conspiratorial element. Jacline Mouraud, whose October 2018 video helped spark the movement, later supported the far-right presidential candidate Eric Zemmour, a committed racist. A direct outgrowth of the Yellow Vests was the phenomenal popularity of the 2020 Covid conspiracy film \u201cHold Up,\u201d as was a vocal anti-mask movement.",
      "The right-wing populist current in the Yellow Vests from just a few years ago has not vanished, and it is making itself felt in the new polls. The Rassemblement National has been the face of the populist right since its beginnings, and its history has been one of growth. These polls are a sign that this move has continued, to the benefit of Ms. Le Pen.",
      "Her rise has been assisted by the missteps of her foes. How the increase in retirement age was finally made law \u2014 bypassing a vote in the National Assembly \u2014 was seen as a confirmation of Mr. Macron\u2019s undemocratic, even authoritarian tendencies. The political center and center right have been neutralized by their support for the president\u2019s unpopular measure. In response, the center and center right are on the attack. It is their opponents, the centrists say, who are the true threat to democracy: the left for its support of violent protests and the far right by its very nature. Mr. Macron\u2019s ministers hammer away at this idea in the media.",
      "For its part, the left has been hampered by its own inadequacies. Mr. M\u00e9lenchon and his coalition, betting heavily that anti-Macron sentiment will benefit them, have lacked a coherent strategy, other than maintaining pressure through advocating increased mobilization while adopting disruptive tactics in the National Assembly. Last October, well before the current crisis, polls showed that their rowdiness during legislative sessions had already led many to think left-wing politicians were incapable of governing.

She has condemned the violence on the streets (though never the police\u2019s), as well as Mr. Macron for \u201closing the meaning of democracy,\u201d adding, \u201cWhen the ruler wants something and the people don\u2019t, it should not be done.\u201d She has promised that she will reverse the retirement age change if \u2014 when \u2014 she\u2019s elected.",
      "Her party\u2019s 88 members of the National Assembly, the third-largest group in the legislative body, have succeeded in further normalizing the far right by playing the role of the adults in the room. The far right is managing to present itself as the defenders of democracy, imperiled by Mr. Macron\u2019s diktats, and of stability, threatened by left-wing chaos.",
      "Is this a durable position? The Yellow Vest movement did not lead to the defeat of Mr. Macron in 2022. But those elections did see Ms. Le Pen receive more votes than her party ever had.",
      "The government\u2019s mishandling of the pension overhaul, from failing to convince the French that it was even necessary to forcing it through when it was unable to obtain a legislative majority, has increased the people\u2019s animus toward politics and politicians. Over the past four decades, every political alternative but the far right has been tried and found wanting \u2014 the Socialists of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the conservatives of Nicolas Sarkozy and the center and Mr. Macron.",
      "Though much of this held true a year ago, the change in the retirement age touched something fundamental in the French, cementing the divorce between the people and politicians. Ms. Le Pen has never held power, and so she has never failed her voters. She offers a fresh start and holds out the promise that, unlike those who have ruled France till now, she will defend the people\u2019s interests. For now, at least, this argument is perhaps the clinching one in the minds of many in France."

      "I\u2019d argue that the biggest change wasn\u2019t the simple passage of time, but the decision of some Republican leaders to focus like a laser on Biden\u2019s age as the factor weighing against him. In an April interview, the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley said it was unlikely Biden would \u201cmake it\u201d through a second term. In this year\u2019s Republican response to the State of the Union address, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Arkansas noted that she\u2019s half Biden\u2019s age.",

There\u2019s Biden\u2019s overall standing \u2014 around 43 percent of Americans approve of his job performance \u2014 which doesn\u2019t compare favorably with past incumbents who did win re-election. There\u2019s the economy, which may hit a downturn between now and next November. And even if it doesn\u2019t, Biden will still have presided over the highest inflation rate since the 1980s. Last, there\u2019s Biden himself. The oldest person ever elected president, next year he will be \u2014 at 81 \u2014 the oldest president to ever stand for re-election. Biden\u2019s age is a real risk that could suddenly become a liability.",
      "If Biden has potential weaknesses, however, it is also true that he doesn\u2019t lack for real advantages. Along with low unemployment, there\u2019s been meaningful economic growth, and he can point to significant legislative accomplishments. The Democratic Party is behind him; he has no serious rivals for the nomination.",
      "But Biden\u2019s biggest advantage has to do with the opposition \u2014 the Republican Party has gotten weird. It\u2019s not just that Republican policies are well outside the mainstream, but that the party itself has tipped over into something very strange.",
      "I had this thought while watching a clip of Ron DeSantis speak from a lectern to an audience we can\u2019t see. In the video, which his press team highlighted on Twitter, DeSantis decries the \u201cwoke mind virus,\u201d which he calls \u201ca form of cultural Marxism that tries to divide us based on identity politics.\u201d",
      "Now, I can follow this as a professional internet user and political observer. I know that \u201cwoke mind virus\u201d is a term of art for the (condescending and misguided) idea that progressive views on race and gender are an outside contagion threatening the minds of young people who might otherwise reject structural explanations of racial inequality and embrace a traditional vision of the gender binary. I know that \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d is a right-wing buzzword meant to sound scary and imposing.",
      "To a normal person, on the other hand, this language is borderline unintelligible. It doesn\u2019t tell you anything; it doesn\u2019t obviously mean anything; and it\u2019s quite likely to be far afield of your interests and concerns.",
      "DeSantis is a regular offender when it comes to speaking in the jargon of culture war-obsessed conservatives, but he\u2019s not the only one. And it\u2019s not just a problem of jargon. Republican politicians \u2014 from presidential contenders to anonymous state legislators \u2014 are monomaniacally focused on banning books, fighting \u201cwokeness\u201d and harassing transgender people. Some Republicans are even still denying the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election, doubling down on the election-related conspiracies that hobbled many Republican candidates in the midterms.",
      "Not only do Americans not care about the various Republican obsessions \u2014 in a recent Fox News poll 1 percent of respondents said \u201cwokeness\u201d was \u201cthe most important issue facing the country today\u201d \u2014 but a large majority say that those obsessions have gone too far. According to Fox, 60 percent of Americans said \u201cbook banning by school boards\u201d was a major problem. Fifty-seven percent said the same for political attacks on families with transgender children.",
      "It is not for nothing that in Biden\u2019s first TV ad of the 2024 campaign, he took specific aim at conservative book bans as a threat to freedom and American democracy.",
      "And yet there\u2019s no sign that Republicans will relent and shift focus. Just the opposite, in fact; the party is poised to lurch even farther down the road of its alienating preoccupations. On abortion, for example, Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, says candidates need to address the issue \u201chead-on\u201d in 2024 \u2014 that they can\u2019t be \u201cuncomfortable\u201d on the issue and need to say \u201cI\u2019m proud to be pro-life.\u201d",
      "But the Republican Party has veered quite far from most Americans on abortion rights, and in a contested race for the presidential nomination, a \u201chead-on\u201d focus will possibly mean a fight over which candidate can claim the most draconian abortion views and policy aims.",
      "There\u2019s more: DeSantis is in the midst of a legal battle with Disney, one of the most beloved companies on the planet, and House Republicans are threatening the global economy in order to pass a set of deeply unpopular spending cuts to widely used assistance programs.",
      "Taken together, it\u2019s as if the Republican Party has committed itself to being as off-putting as possible to as many Americans as possible. That doesn\u2019t mean the party is doomed, of course. But as of this moment, it is hard to say it\u2019s on the road to political success.",
      "As for Joe Biden? The current state of the Republican Party only strengthens his most important political asset \u2014 his normalcy. He promised, in 2020, that he would be a normal president. And he is promising, for 2024, to continue to serve as a normal president. Normal isn\u2019t fun and normal isn\u2019t exciting.

      "Joe Biden has, to nobody\u2019s surprise, formally announced that he is seeking re-election. And I, for one, am dreading the year and a half of political crystal ball gazing that lies ahead of us \u2014 a discussion to which I will have little if anything to add.",
      "One thing I may be able to contribute to, however, is the way we talk about the Biden economy. Much political discussion, it seems to me, is informed by a sense that the economy will be a major liability for Democrats \u2014 a sense that is strongly affected by out-of-date or questionable data.",
      "Of course, a lot can change between now and November 2024. We could have a recession, maybe as the delayed effect of monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve. We might all too easily face a financial crisis this summer when, as seems likely, Republicans refuse to raise the debt ceiling \u2014 and nobody knows how that will play out politically.",
      "Right now, however, the economy is in better shape than I suspect most pundits or even generally well-informed readers may realize.",
      "The basic story of the Biden economy is that America has experienced a remarkably fast and essentially complete job market recovery. This recovery was initially accompanied by distressingly high inflation; but inflation, while still high by the standards of the past few decades, has subsided substantially. The overall situation is, well, not so bad.",
      "About jobs: Unless you\u2019ve been getting your news from Tucker Carlson or Truth Social, you\u2019re probably aware that the unemployment rate is hovering near historic lows. However, I keep hearing assertions that this number is misleading, because millions of Americans have dropped out of the labor force \u2014 which was true a year ago.",
      "But it\u2019s not true anymore. There are multiple ways to make this point, but one way is to compare where we are now with projections made just before Covid struck. In January 2020 the Congressional Budget Office projected that by the first quarter of 2023 nonfarm employment would be 154.8 million; the actual number for March was 155.6 million. As a recent report from the Council of Economic Advisers points out, labor force participation \u2014 the percentage of adults either working or actively looking for work \u2014 is also right back in line with pre-Covid projections.",
      "In short, we really are back at full employment.",
      "Inflation isn\u2019t as happy a picture. If we measure inflation by the annual rate of change in consumer prices over the past six months \u2014 my current preference for trying to extract the signal from the noise \u2014 inflation was almost 10 percent in June 2022. But it\u2019s now down to just 3.5 percent.",
      "That\u2019s still above the Fed\u2019s target of 2 percent, and there\u2019s intense debate among economists about how hard it will be to get inflation all the way down (intense because nobody really knows the answer). But maybe some perspective is in order. The current inflation rate is lower than it was at the end of Ronald Reagan\u2019s second term.",
      "Or consider the \u201cmisery index,\u201d the sum of unemployment and inflation \u2014 a crude measure that nonetheless seems to do a pretty good job of predicting consumer sentiment. Using six-month inflation, that index is currently about 7, roughly the same as it was in 2017, when few people considered the economy a disaster.",
      "But never mind these fancy statistics \u2014 don\u2019t people perceive the economy as terrible? After all, news coverage tends to emphasize the negative: You hear a lot about soaring prices of gasoline or eggs, much less when they come back down. Even amid a vast jobs boom, consumers report having heard much more negative than positive news about employment.",
      "Even so, do people consider the economy awful? It depends on whom you ask. The venerable Michigan Survey still shows consumer sentiment at levels heretofore associated with severe economic crises. But the also well-established Conference Board survey \u2014 which, as it happens, has a much larger sample size \u2014 tells a different story: Its \u201cpresent situation\u201d index is fairly high, roughly comparable to what it was in 2017. That is, it\u2019s more or less in line with the misery index.",

      "Joe Biden is officially running for re-election, and his candidacy will put some Democratic voters \u2014 those not only skittish about his age but also about his passion for policy \u2014 in a vise: They recognize the threat from the leading Republican candidates, but they\u2019ve been underwhelmed by Biden, who\u2019d be 82 at the start of a second term.",
      "The age question is a major concern for Biden, according to political advisers I\u2019ve spoken to recently \u2014 and according to the chatter on cable news and online. And the sense that he has underwhelmed is particularly problematic for Biden when it comes to young voters. According to an Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School poll of 18-to 29-year-olds released Monday, just 36 percent of young Americans approve of Biden\u2019s job performance. That number has steadily dropped over the course of his presidency.",
      "Though young voters were only 17 percent of the 2020 electorate, they\u2019ll probably be a key to another Biden win, since he won about 60 percent of the 18-to-29 vote last time around. Younger voters can also be barometers of how much a candidate\u2019s passion factors into his appeal.",
      "I reached out to several voting rights advocates and political organizers to discuss Biden\u2019s bid, and the overall impression settles somewhere between cautious optimism and dampened enthusiasm not so much about Biden\u2019s age but about how voters, including younger voters, look at his policy priorities. As Clifford Albright, a co-founder and the executive director of the Black Voters Matter Fund, told me, although younger voters would generally like to see younger candidates, \u201cthe age thing can be overcome if you\u2019re talking about the right issues.\u201d",
      "Albright mentioned the presidential candidacies of Senator Bernie Sanders, who\u2019s about a year older than Biden. As a contender for the Democratic nomination, he said, Sanders was held aloft by young voters because he vociferously championed issues that they cared about. They felt that he was fighting for them.",
      "It\u2019s on those issues where some activists seemed to think Biden had left an opening for voter disappointment. They weren\u2019t na\u00efve about the structural obstacles in the way Congress operates that made legislative progress difficult, if not impossible, but they simply didn\u2019t believe that Biden went down fighting on some of the initiatives that younger Democratic voters cared about most.",
      "One that sticks in their craws, undoubtedly because they deal with voting rights, was a sense that Biden didn\u2019t fight hard enough for the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.",
      "Nse Ufot, the founder of the New South Super PAC, chastised Biden for speaking about the voting rights bill at the Atlanta University Center \u2014 a consortium of four historically Black colleges and universities, in a state where both senators were already committed to voting for the law \u2014 ahead of a push to the pass the bill, knowing there weren\u2019t enough votes to pass it. Biden \u201cshould have been in West Virginia,\u201d said Ufot, and \u201cshould have been in Phoenix, Ariz., because those are the people who need to hear it.\u201d",
      "She said it seemed almost like a coach coming to the sideline to console a team in defeat even though there was still time left on the clock and the game was still being played. It just didn\u2019t feel like an all-out effort to go down swinging.",
      "Ufot, channeling the rapper Ice Cube, said of Biden, \u201cI need you to put your back into it!\u201d",
      "But both Ufot and Albright considered the hesitation about Biden\u2019s age a bit of a red herring. For them, policy and voter engagement \u2014 and the time and resources put into both \u2014 will be more determinative.",
      "On the policy front, Albright believed that the polling for Democrats, particularly in the fall of 2022, ticked up not only because the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade but also because Biden finally took action on student loan forgiveness, the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (with the most significant climate provisions in American history) and the passage of relatively narrow but still significant federal gun legislation.

      "Only 47 percent of Democrats want to see Joe Biden on the ballot in 2024, according to the latest Associated Press poll. That\u2019s not because they think he\u2019s done a bad job in office. Democrats tend to like President Biden and continue to give him good marks on handling the economy and foreign policy.",
      "But many Democrats, particularly younger ones, are worried that he will simply be too old to be effective in a second term, which would end when he is 86. \u201cMy problem with him running in 2024 is that he\u2019s just so old,\u201d one Democrat told pollsters.",
      "That may be deeply unfair \u2014 people age at different rates \u2014 and in Mr. Biden\u2019s case, it\u2019s impossible to deny that politics and conspiracy theories, rather than facts, fuel at least some of the concern. But candidates shouldn\u2019t pretend, as Mr. Biden often does, that advanced age isn\u2019t an issue. Mr. Biden is 80 now, the oldest American to serve as president, and even supporters, including the political strategist David Axelrod, have expressed deep worries that his age will be both a political liability in 2024 and a barrier to a successful second term. If Mr. Biden runs again, as he recently said he intends to, questions will persist about his age until he does more to assure voters that he is up to the job.",
      "Mr. Biden\u2019s age makes him an outlier even in an era when the nation\u2019s political leadership is getting older. The current Senate, where the average age is 63.9 years, is the second oldest since 1789. The House, where the average age is 57.5 years, is the third oldest. By comparison, the average age in the United States is 38.8 years.",
      "Concerns about age \u2014 both in terms of fitness for office and being out of touch with the moment \u2014 are legitimate, as Mr. Biden acknowledged in an interview in February with ABC News. His standard line, repeated in that interview, is: \u201cThe only thing I can say is, \u2018Watch me.\u2019\u201d",
      "But Mr. Biden has given voters very few chances to do just that \u2014 to watch him \u2014 and his refusal to engage with the public regularly raises questions about his age and health.",
      "The usual White House method of demonstrating a president\u2019s mastery is to take tough questions in front of cameras, but Mr. Biden has not taken advantage of that opportunity, as The Times reported on Friday. He has held fewer news conferences and media interviews than most of his modern predecessors. Since 1923, only Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan took fewer questions per month from reporters, and neither represents a model of presidential openness that Mr. Biden should want to emulate. His reticence has created an opening for critics and skeptics.",
      "The president also needs to talk about his health openly and without embarrassment, and to end the pretense that it doesn\u2019t matter. Those who are watching him with an open mind have seen a strong performance this year. His State of the Union address on Feb. 7 shattered the Republican attempts to portray him as doddering. With a passion rarely seen at one of these speeches \u2014 let alone in his political history \u2014 Mr. Biden presented a remarkably effective defense of his presidency and gave a preview of what is likely to be an imminent re-election campaign.",
      "The Times reported last summer that Mr. Biden\u2019s overall energy level has declined, and he continues to stumble over words in his public appearances. But those flaws alone don\u2019t signal a politician who is too old to run again. His first term, in fact, is already full of accomplishment: The economy has added 12.6 million jobs since he took office, inflation is cooling, and he has signed significant legislation to fight climate change, improve access to health care, and make investments in manufacturing and infrastructure. He has stood up to Russia\u2019s destructive campaign in Ukraine, and rallied the West to Ukraine\u2019s side.",
      "Nonetheless, as Mr. Biden nears his actuarial life expectancy, concerns about his ability to handle the demands of campaigning and a potential second term are unlikely to disappear. Only a combination of performance and complete candor will change the minds of skeptical voters. Old age remains a sensitive topic, and many people, particularly men, are reluctant to discuss personal infirmities for fear of demonstrating weakness or being pushed aside by impatient younger generations. There is good reason for the federal government\u2019s prohibition of age discrimination in employment \u2014 a protection that begins at age 40. Ageism is real.",
      "That law, however, doesn\u2019t apply to people who are running for office. Voters have every right to ask questions about the medical condition of a candidate who wants their support. In 2016 both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton gave the public very few details about their health. (Mr. Trump released a particularly preposterous doctor\u2019s letter claiming he would be \u201cthe healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.\u201d)",
      "Mr. Biden acknowledged during the lead-up to the 2020 campaign that he was \u201cchronologically\u201d old but said it was up to voters to decide whether that was important. In that election, against an opponent who was only four years younger, the answer was clearly no. In November 2021, he released a medical report that said he was a \u201chealthy, vigorous 78-year-old\u201d and noted nothing more serious than a stiffened gait due to spinal changes and some acid reflux that caused him to cough.",
      "His most recent health summary, released on Feb. 16, said much the same thing, describing him as a \u201chealthy, vigorous 80-year-old male who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency.\u201d But his cognitive abilities went unmentioned. That\u2019s something he should discuss publicly and also demonstrate to the voters, who expect the president to reflect the nation\u2019s strength.",
      "If he runs again, Mr. Biden will need to provide explicit reassurance to voters; many of them have seen family members decline rapidly in their 80s. Americans are watching what Mr. Biden says and does, just as he has asked them to do."

      "In their forthcoming book, \u201cBeyond Doubt: The Secularization of Society,\u201d the sociologists Isabella Kasselstrand, Phil Zuckerman and Ryan Cragun describe a change in the built environment of St. Louis that is \u201cemblematic\u201d of the ebb of organized religious observance in America. What was once a Gothic-style beauty of a Catholic church built in the 19th century by German immigrants had been turned into a skateboard park.",
      "\u201cIn the United States,\u201d the authors tell us, \u201csomewhere between 6,000 and 10,000 churches close down every year, either to be repurposed as apartments, laundries, laser-tag arenas, or skate parks, or to simply be demolished.\u201d (I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that my apartment was once the rectory of a church, also built in the 1800s and transformed, a couple of decades ago, into condos for yuppies who want dramatic windows and a hint of ecclesiastical flavor.)",
      "It\u2019s not just the frequency of churchgoing or temple membership that\u2019s declining in our country: Last month, The Wall Street Journal and NORC at the University of Chicago surveyed around 1,000 American adults about the importance of different values to Americans, including the importance of religion. In 2023, only 39 percent of respondents said religion was very important to them, compared to 62 percent who said that in 1998.",
      "When you look at the full results, the picture becomes a bit more complicated. Sixty percent of respondents said that religion was either somewhat or very important to them, and only 19 percent said religion was not important to them at all. The United States is still a more religiously observant country than our peer nations in Western Europe \u2014 according to Pew Research in 2018, for example, we are more likely to believe in God or some kind of higher power and more likely to pray daily.",
      "But two things can be true at the same time, said Mark Chaves, a professor of sociology at Duke Divinity School who directs the National Congregations Study: America can still be a comparatively observant nation and religious observance can be on the decline in various dimensions, happening at different paces, Chaves explains. \u201cThe decline in religious belief and interest is much slower than the decline in organizational participation,\u201d he said when we spoke.",
      "For example, few Americans say they don\u2019t believe in God at all, and while that minority has grown, it\u2019s still very small. According to NORC data, atheists only made up about 2 percent to 3 percent of the population from 1988 to 2012. By 2021, atheists were 7 percent of the population. In 1988, 17 percent of Americans said they never attended religious services. In 2021, that number was 31 percent.",
      "Religion\u2019s meaning to people goes well beyond regular attendance at a local church, temple or mosque, or trust in religious leaders. That\u2019s why polling questions don\u2019t always capture the whole picture of American religious observance. There\u2019s been a lot of coverage about the rise of what pollsters sometimes call \u201cnones\u201d \u2014 people who say they have no religion in particular, which, according to Gallup, went from 0 percent to 2 percent of the population in the early 1950s to plateauing at around 20 percent of the population from 2017 to 2022.",
      "But it would be incorrect to say that nones don\u2019t retain any trappings of religious observance, like belief in a higher power or performing certain rituals. It doesn\u2019t even mean they never attend church. As Zuckerman, one of the authors of \u201cBeyond Doubt\u201d and a professor at Pitzer College, explained to me over the phone, when social scientists talk about religion, they do it in terms of \u201cthe three B\u2019s: belief, behavior and belonging.\u201d If someone asks you about your religion and you say you don\u2019t have any, Zuckerman said, \u201cthat tells me nothing about your beliefs, and that tells me nothing about your behavior. It just tells me how you identify.\u201d",
      "Since I started reporting this story, I\u2019ve been asking members of my unobservant family what they\u2019d say if a pollster asked them what their religious affiliations are. (Aware of the caveat that both sociologists I talked to noted: Responses are often shaped by how the question is asked.)",
      "None of us have set foot in a temple or church in years. My mother and I both said we would identify as Jewish. My father \u2014 who has two Jewish parents and was bar mitzvahed \u2014 said he\u2019d identify as \u201cnothing\u201d and instead likes to joke about erecting a statue of Athena in his yard. My husband, who was baptized Episcopalian but didn\u2019t always go to church regularly growing up, said he would identify as Christian. My 10-year-old said she didn\u2019t know what she would say. These responses, especially my dad\u2019s and my husband\u2019s, were surprising to me.",
      "Because this topic is so much more complicated than \u201cAmericans used to be religious and now we\u2019re not,\u201d I\u2019m making this the first newsletter in a series where I\u2019ll explore the contours of our current relationship with religion, and try to unpack how we got here and what\u2019s changed over the past several decades.",
      "My goal: to inject some nuance and specificity into this discussion, since I feel like it can be and sometimes is dominated by partisans who want to argue that the decline in religiosity is either uniformly good or bad for society.

      "But two things can be true at the same time, said Mark Chaves, a professor of sociology at Duke Divinity School who directs the National Congregations Study: America can still be a comparatively observant nation and religious observance can be on the decline in various dimensions, happening at different paces, Chaves explains. \u201cThe decline in religious belief and interest is much slower than the decline in organizational participation,\u201d he said when we spoke.",
      "For example, few Americans say they don\u2019t believe in God at all, and while that minority has grown, it\u2019s still very small. According to NORC data, atheists only made up about 2 percent to 3 percent of the population from 1988 to 2012. By 2021, atheists were 7 percent of the population. In 1988, 17 percent of Americans said they never attended religious services. In 2021, that number was 31 percent.",
      "Religion\u2019s meaning to people goes well beyond regular attendance at a local church, temple or mosque, or trust in religious leaders. That\u2019s why polling questions don\u2019t always capture the whole picture of American religious observance. There\u2019s been a lot of coverage about the rise of what pollsters sometimes call \u201cnones\u201d \u2014 people who say they have no religion in particular, which, according to Gallup, went from 0 percent to 2 percent of the population in the early 1950s to plateauing at around 20 percent of the population from 2017 to 2022.",
      "But it would be incorrect to say that nones don\u2019t retain any trappings of religious observance, like belief in a higher power or performing certain rituals. It doesn\u2019t even mean they never attend church. As Zuckerman, one of the authors of \u201cBeyond Doubt\u201d and a professor at Pitzer College, explained to me over the phone, when social scientists talk about religion, they do it in terms of \u201cthe three B\u2019s: belief, behavior and belonging.\u201d If someone asks you about your religion and you say you don\u2019t have any, Zuckerman said, \u201cthat tells me nothing about your beliefs, and that tells me nothing about your behavior. It just tells me how you identify.\u201d",
      "Since I started reporting this story, I\u2019ve been asking members of my unobservant family what they\u2019d say if a pollster asked them what their religious affiliations are. (Aware of the caveat that both sociologists I talked to noted: Responses are often shaped by how the question is asked.)",
      "None of us have set foot in a temple or church in years. My mother and I both said we would identify as Jewish. My father \u2014 who has two Jewish parents and was bar mitzvahed \u2014 said he\u2019d identify as \u201cnothing\u201d and instead likes to joke about erecting a statue of Athena in his yard. My husband, who was baptized Episcopalian but didn\u2019t always go to church regularly growing up, said he would identify as Christian. My 10-year-old said she didn\u2019t know what she would say. These responses, especially my dad\u2019s and my husband\u2019s, were surprising to me.",
      "Because this topic is so much more complicated than \u201cAmericans used to be religious and now we\u2019re not,\u201d I\u2019m making this the first newsletter in a series where I\u2019ll explore the contours of our current relationship with religion, and try to unpack how we got here and what\u2019s changed over the past several decades.",
      "My goal: to inject some nuance and specificity into this discussion, since I feel like it can be and sometimes is dominated by partisans who want to argue that the decline in religiosity is either uniformly good or bad for society. My own feeling is one of profound ambivalence. I have no interest in going back to temple and little trust or appetite for organized religion. But I feel passionately about being Jewish, and a little heartsick about not knowing quite how to pass along my ritual and history to my children. I do wonder about what may be lost by not having a community connected by belief, but I\u2019m not quite sure what that is, or if replacing it is possible, or even desirable.",
      "I\u2019d like to hear from you. If you were once observant or religious and are less so now, and would like to share your experience, please answer the questions in the form below. I may reach out to you for future installments of this newsletter.",

      "The resurgence of Donald Trump in the 2024 primary polls, the unsurprising evidence that his supporters will stand by him through a prosecution and the tentativeness of Ron DeSantis\u2019s precampaign have combined to create a buzz that maybe DeSantis shouldn\u2019t run at all. It\u2019s been whispered by nervous donors, shouted by Trump\u2019s supporters and lately raised by pundits of the left and right.",
      "Thus the liberal Bill Scher, writing in The Washington Monthly, argues that Trump looks too strong, that there isn\u2019t a clear-enough constituency for DeSantis\u2019s promise of Trumpism without the florid drama and that if DeSantis runs and fails, he\u2019s more likely to end up \u201cviciously humiliated,\u201d like Trump\u2019s 2016 rivals, than to set himself up as the next in line for 2028.",
      "Then from the right, writing for The Spectator, Daniel McCarthy channels Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli to argue that while DeSantis probably will run, he would be wiser to choose a more dogged, long-term path instead \u2014 emphasizing \u201cvirtu\u201d rather than chasing Fortune, to use Machiavelli\u2019s language. In 2024 Trump might poison the prospects of any G.O.P. candidate who beats him, while Joe Biden could be a relatively potent incumbent. But if the Florida governor continues to build a record of conservative accomplishment in his home state, \u201c2028 would offer a well-prepared DeSantis a clear shot.\u201d",
      "I think they\u2019re both wrong and that if DeSantis has presidential ambitions he simply has to run right now, notwithstanding all of the obstacles that they identify. My reasoning depends both on the Fortune that McCarthy invokes and on an argument that Scher\u2019s piece nods to while rejecting: the idea that presidential candidates are more likely to miss their moment \u2014 as Chris Christie did when he passed on running in 2012, as Mario Cuomo did for his entire career \u2014 than they are to run too early and suffer a career-ending rebuke.",
      "It\u2019s true that Fortune doesn\u2019t always favor the bold. (As McCarthy notes, that phrase originates in Virgil\u2019s \u201cAeneid,\u201d where it\u2019s uttered by an Italian warlord just before he gets killed.) But the key to the don\u2019t-miss-your-moment argument is that when it comes to something as difficult as gaining the presidency, mostly Fortune doesn\u2019t favor anybody. All would-be presidents, no matter their virtues as politicians, are inevitably hostage to events, depending on unusual synchronicities to open a path to the White House.",
      "A great many successful political careers never have that path open at all. A minority have it open in the narrowest way, where you can imagine threading needles and rolling lucky sixes all the way to the White House. Only a tiny number are confronted with a situation where they seem to have a strong chance, not just a long-shot possibility, before they even announce their candidacy.",
      "That\u2019s where DeSantis sits right now. The political betting site PredictIt places his odds of being elected president in 2024, expressed as a share price, at 23 cents, slightly below Trump\u2019s and well below Biden\u2019s, but far above everybody else\u2019s. Those odds, representing a roughly 20 percent chance at the White House, sound about right to me. If you look at national polls since Trump\u2019s indictment, DeSantis\u2019s support has dipped only slightly; if you look at polls of early primary states, he\u2019s clearly within striking distance, Trump has a floor of support but also a lot of voters who aren\u2019t eager to rally to him (his indictment may have solidified support, but it didn\u2019t make his numbers soar), and DeSantis has not yet even begun to campaign. He\u2019s in a much better position than any of Trump\u2019s rivals ever were in 2016, and you could argue that he starts out closer to the nomination than any Republican candidate did in 2008 or 2012.",
      "Not to run now is to throw this proximity away, in the hopes of starting out even closer four years hence. But DeSantis\u2019s current position is itself a creation of unusual political good fortune. Yes, he\u2019s been skillful, but that skill wouldn\u2019t have gotten him here without events beyond anyone\u2019s control \u2014 the Covid-19 pandemic, the woke revolution in liberal institutions, the split between Mike Pence and Trump after Jan. 6, the strength of the Florida economy and more.",
      "It\u2019s obviously possible to imagine a future where Fortune continues to favor DeSantis and he goes into 2028 as the prohibitive favorite. But time and chance are cruel, and there are many more paths where events conspire against him and he wakes up in 2027 staring at PredictIt odds of 5 percent instead.",
      "If he were at 5 percent odds right now \u2014 if Trump were leading him 75 to 20 in New Hampshire and Iowa rather than roughly 40 to 30 or if Biden\u2019s approval ratings stood at 70 percent instead of 43 percent \u2014 I would buy the argument for waiting.",

      "The resurgence of Donald Trump in the 2024 primary polls, the unsurprising evidence that his supporters will stand by him through a prosecution and the tentativeness of Ron DeSantis\u2019s precampaign have combined to create a buzz that maybe DeSantis shouldn\u2019t run at all. It\u2019s been whispered by nervous donors, shouted by Trump\u2019s supporters and lately raised by pundits of the left and right.",
      "Thus the liberal Bill Scher, writing in The Washington Monthly, argues that Trump looks too strong, that there isn\u2019t a clear-enough constituency for DeSantis\u2019s promise of Trumpism without the florid drama and that if DeSantis runs and fails, he\u2019s more likely to end up \u201cviciously humiliated,\u201d like Trump\u2019s 2016 rivals, than to set himself up as the next in line for 2028.",
      "Then from the right, writing for The Spectator, Daniel McCarthy channels Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli to argue that while DeSantis probably will run, he would be wiser to choose a more dogged, long-term path instead \u2014 emphasizing \u201cvirtu\u201d rather than chasing Fortune, to use Machiavelli\u2019s language. In 2024 Trump might poison the prospects of any G.O.P. candidate who beats him, while Joe Biden could be a relatively potent incumbent. But if the Florida governor continues to build a record of conservative accomplishment in his home state, \u201c2028 would offer a well-prepared DeSantis a clear shot.\u201d",
      "I think they\u2019re both wrong and that if DeSantis has presidential ambitions he simply has to run right now, notwithstanding all of the obstacles that they identify. My reasoning depends both on the Fortune that McCarthy invokes and on an argument that Scher\u2019s piece nods to while rejecting: the idea that presidential candidates are more likely to miss their moment \u2014 as Chris Christie did when he passed on running in 2012, as Mario Cuomo did for his entire career \u2014 than they are to run too early and suffer a career-ending rebuke.",
      "It\u2019s true that Fortune doesn\u2019t always favor the bold. (As McCarthy notes, that phrase originates in Virgil\u2019s \u201cAeneid,\u201d where it\u2019s uttered by an Italian warlord just before he gets killed.) But the key to the don\u2019t-miss-your-moment argument is that when it comes to something as difficult as gaining the presidency, mostly Fortune doesn\u2019t favor anybody. All would-be presidents, no matter their virtues as politicians, are inevitably hostage to events, depending on unusual synchronicities to open a path to the White House.",
      "A great many successful political careers never have that path open at all. A minority have it open in the narrowest way, where you can imagine threading needles and rolling lucky sixes all the way to the White House. Only a tiny number are confronted with a situation where they seem to have a strong chance, not just a long-shot possibility, before they even announce their candidacy.",
      "That\u2019s where DeSantis sits right now. The political betting site PredictIt places his odds of being elected president in 2024, expressed as a share price, at 23 cents, slightly below Trump\u2019s and well below Biden\u2019s, but far above everybody else\u2019s. Those odds, representing a roughly 20 percent chance at the White House, sound about right to me. If you look at national polls since Trump\u2019s indictment, DeSantis\u2019s support has dipped only slightly; if you look at polls of early primary states, he\u2019s clearly within striking distance, Trump has a floor of support but also a lot of voters who aren\u2019t eager to rally to him (his indictment may have solidified support, but it didn\u2019t make his numbers soar), and DeSantis has not yet even begun to campaign. He\u2019s in a much better position than any of Trump\u2019s rivals ever were in 2016, and you could argue that he starts out closer to the nomination than any Republican candidate did in 2008 or 2012.",
      "Not to run now is to throw this proximity away, in the hopes of starting out even closer four years hence. But DeSantis\u2019s current position is itself a creation of unusual political good fortune. Yes, he\u2019s been skillful, but that skill wouldn\u2019t have gotten him here without events beyond anyone\u2019s control \u2014 the Covid-19 pandemic, the woke revolution in liberal institutions, the split between Mike Pence and Trump after Jan. 6, the strength of the Florida economy and more.",

      "After the Republican Party\u2019s disappointing performance in the 2022 midterms, fueled in large part by a backlash to the Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of Roe v. Wade, the Republican National Committee recommitted itself to anti-abortion maximalism.",

      "The 11-point loss of the Republican-aligned candidate in Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court election on Tuesday has influential conservatives rethinking this strategy. \u201cRepublicans had better get their abortion position straight, and more in line with where voters are, or they will face another disappointment in 2024,\u201d said a Wall Street Journal editorial.",
      "Ann Coulter tweeted, \u201cThe demand for anti-abortion legislation just cost Republicans another crucial race,\u201d and added, \u201cPlease stop pushing strict limits on abortion, or there will be no Republicans left.\u201d Jon Schweppe, policy director of the socially conservative American Principles Project, lamented, \u201cWe are getting killed by indie voters who think we support full bans with no exceptions.\u201d",
      "But having made the criminalization of abortion a central axis of their political project for decades, Republicans have no obvious way out of their electoral predicament.

About 40 percent of those surveyed said they had delayed or gone without care in the last year because of the expense. People in fair or poor health were more than twice as likely to report problems with paying medical bills than those in better health, and Black adults were more likely than white adults to indicate they had trouble.",
      "Nearly half of those who encountered a problem with their insurance said they could not satisfactorily resolve it. Some could not obtain the care they had sought, while others said they paid more than expected. Among the nearly 60 percent who reported difficulty with their insurance coverage, 15 percent said their health had declined.",
      "\u201cThis survey shows it\u2019s not enough to just get a card in your pocket \u2014 the insurance has to work or it\u2019s not exactly coverage,\u201d said Karen Pollitz, the co-director for KFF\u2019s patient and consumer protections program.",
      "People have a hard time understanding their coverage and benefits, with 30 percent or more reporting difficulty figuring out what they will be required to pay for care or what exactly their insurance will cover.",
      "\u201cInsurances are way more complicated than they should be,\u201d said Amanda Parente, a 19-year-old college student in Nashville who is covered under her mother\u2019s employer plan. She was surprised to find that her out-of-pocket costs spiked recently when she sought treatment for strep throat. While she realized her co-payments would be higher, \u201cI guess we didn\u2019t know how drastic it was going to be,\u201d she said.",
      "Navigating the intricacies of coverage and benefits were similar regardless of what kind of insurance people had. At least half of those surveyed with private coverage, through an employer, those with an Obamacare plan, or a government program like Medicare or Medicaid, said they experienced difficulties.",
      "People might be unhappy with their coverage because they were already concerned about higher inflation and potential layoffs, said Christopher Lis, the managing director of global health care intelligence at J.D. Power, which found that consumer satisfaction with insurers had declined in a recent study. \u201cWe\u2019ve got economic conditions that set the stage for concern around coverage and benefits,\u201d he said.",
      "Insurers say people generally report being happy with their plan, and 81 percent of those surveyed by KFF gave their insurance high ratings. \u201cHealth insurance providers are committed to improving access, affordability and convenience for all Americans and will continue to find innovative solutions to work toward this common goal,\u201d said David Allen, a spokesman for AHIP, a trade group that represents insurers.",
      "Also striking among the survey\u2019s findings was how unaware people were about pursuing appeals of denied coverage and how to go about doing so.",
      "\u201cMost people don\u2019t know who to call,\u201d Ms. Pollitz said. Sixty percent of insured adults surveyed did not know they had a legal right to appeal, and about three-fourths said they did not know which government agency to contact for help, particularly respondents with private insurance.",
      "State insurance regulators oversee fully insured policies sold to individuals and small businesses, and the federal Department of Labor has jurisdiction over employer-sponsored insurance.",
      "Many of the problems people have with their insurance could be solved by enforcing existing rules, like federal regulations requiring private insurers to issue understandable explanations of benefits and to maintain accurate, current lists of doctors and hospitals within their networks."

      "About 60 percent of U.S. voters do not have a four-year college degree, and they live disproportionately in swing states. As a result, these voters \u2014 often described as the American working class \u2014 are crucial to winning elections. Yet many of them are deeply skeptical of today\u2019s Democratic Party.",
      "Republicans retook control of the House last year by winning most districts with below-median incomes. In nearly 20 Western and Southern states, Democrats are virtually shut out of statewide offices largely because of their weakness among the white working class. Since 2018, the party has also lost ground with Black, Asian and especially Latino voters.",
      "Unless the party improves its standing with blue-collar voters, \u201cthere\u2019s no way for progressive Democrats to advance their agenda in the Senate,\u201d according to a study that the Center for Working-Class Politics, a left-leaning research group, released this morning.",
      "The class inversion of American politics \u2014 with most professionals supporting Democrats and more working-class people backing Republicans \u2014 is one of the most consequential developments in American life (and, as regular readers know, a continuing theme of this newsletter).",
      "Today, I\u2019ll be writing about what Democrats might do about the problem, focusing on a new YouGov poll, conducted as part of the Center for Working-Class Politics study. In an upcoming newsletter, I\u2019ll examine the issue from a conservative perspective and specifically how Republicans might alter their economic agenda to better serve their new working-class base.",
      "A key point is that even modest shifts in the working-class vote can decide elections. If President Biden wins 50 percent of the non-college vote next year, he will almost certainly be re-elected. If he wins only 45 percent, he will probably lose.",
      "Elections can be tricky for social scientists to study. The sample sizes are small and idiosyncratic. Researchers can\u2019t conduct hundreds of elections in a laboratory, changing one variable at a time and analyzing how the results change. But researchers can conduct polls that pit hypothetical candidates against each other and see how the results change when the candidates\u2019 biographies, messages and policy proposals change.",
      "This approach, which has become more common among pollsters, is the one that YouGov used. It focused on swing voters \u2014 those who don\u2019t identify strongly with either party, many of whom are working class. The poll described a pair of Democratic candidates, each with a biography and a campaign platform, and asked respondents which one they preferred.",
      "Among the findings:",
      "I find the study\u2019s conclusions fascinating because they are both original and consistent with other evidence. Democrats who have won difficult recent elections, including both progressives and moderates, have often presented a blue-collar image.",
      "President Biden talks about growing up in a working-class neighborhood. Marie Gluesenkamp P\u00e9rez, who owns a car-repair shop, flipped a House district in Washington State partly by criticizing her own party for being elitist. Senator Sherrod Brown, the only Democrat to win statewide in Ohio since 2011, is a populist. So is John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, the only Senate candidate from either party to flip a seat last year.",
      "Many Americans are frustrated with the country\u2019s direction, and they want candidates who will promise to fight for their interests. One of the vulnerabilities of today\u2019s Democratic Party, as my colleague Nate Cohn has written, is that it has come to be associated with the establishment.",
