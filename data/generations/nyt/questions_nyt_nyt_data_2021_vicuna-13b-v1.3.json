    "context": "On Javier Mackey\u2019s second deployment to Afghanistan, one of his friends was shot in an ambush and bled to death in his arms. He saw high-ranking Afghan officers selling off equipment for personal gain and Afghan troops running away during firefights. And he started wondering what the United States could really achieve by sending thousands of troops to a distant land that seemed to have never known peace. That was in 2008.Mr. Mackey, an Army Special Forces soldier, deployed there five more times, was shot twice, and, he said, grew more cynical on each trip, until he decided the only sensible thing for the United States to do was cut its losses and leave.Even so, seeing the swift and chaotic collapse of the Afghan government in recent days hit him with the intensity of a bomb blast.\u201cIt\u2019s pain \u2014 pain I thought I had gotten used to,\u201d said Mr. Mackey, who retired as a sergeant first class in 2018 and now lives in Florida. \u201cI sacrificed a lot, I saw death every year. And the guys I served with, we knew it would probably come to an end like this. But to see it end in chaos, it makes us angry. After everything we gave, I just wish there had been a way to leave with honor.\u201dIn the 20 years that the United States military was in Afghanistan, more than 775,000 American troops deployed there, to citylike air bases and sandbag outposts on lonely mountaintops. As the Taliban swept into Kabul on Sunday, wiping away any gains made, veterans said in interviews that they watched with a roiling mix of sadness, rage and relief. Some were thankful that America\u2019s involvement in the country seemed to have ended, but were also dismayed that hard-won progress was squandered. Others were fearful for Afghan friends left behind.In interviews, text messages and on Facebook, men and women who collectively spent decades in Afghanistan said they were angry that despite a drawdown that has spanned years, the United States could not manage to exit the country with more dignity.The anguish can be especially raw because veterans often worked side by side with Afghans during the years of attempts at nation-building, and now in that nation\u2019s collapse they see the individual faces of friends who have been enveloped by the anarchy.\u201cMy heart breaks for the Afghan people,\u201d said Ginger Wallace, a retired Air Force colonel who in 2012 oversaw a program that retrained low-level Taliban fighters to clear land mines and work in other jobs that offered an alternative to combat.At the time, she thought that efforts to stabilize Afghanistan were succeeding, and that American troops would one day leave the country a better place. But her optimism slowly wore down as the Taliban gained ground.\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking, absolutely. I hate to see it end like this, but you don\u2019t know what else we could have done,\u201d she said in an interview from her home in Louisville, Ky. \u201cDo we have an expectation that U.S. service members should stay and fight the Taliban when the Afghan Army won\u2019t?\u201dMs. Wallace met her wife, Janet Holliday, while deployed in Afghanistan. The two normally watch the news each morning, but on Monday, as scenes of mayhem unfolded at the airport in Kabul, Ms. Holliday, a retired Army colonel, switched to the Food Channel.\u201cIt was too hard to watch,\u201d Ms. Holliday said, excusing herself as she became upset. \u201cI just can\u2019t help thinking about what a waste it is. I can\u2019t allow myself to think about how after all that blood and treasure, it ends like this.\u201dMore than with other wars in the nation\u2019s history, Americans have been mostly insulated from the fighting in Afghanistan. There was no draft or mass mobilization. Less than 1 percent of the nation served and a disproportionate number of troops came from rural counties in the South and West, far from the seats of power.But veterans have said in interviews over the years that they were cleareyed about the challenges posed by the war, perhaps more so than the rest of the nation. They saw firsthand the deeply ingrained traditional cultures, tribal allegiances and endemic corruption that continually hobbled American efforts.Mr. Mackey agreed with President Biden\u2019s decision to withdraw, but thought the way it was done was slapdash and unprofessional.\u201cWe train to have contingencies. The way it was handled was just irresponsible,\u201d Mr. Mackey said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to have another Vietnam, we wanted to do better.\u201dJake Wood was a 25-year-old Marine sniper deployed to a forgotten corner of Afghanistan in 2008 when he started to see how much daylight there was between the optimistic pronouncements of top American leaders and the reality of serving with Afghans on the ground.Villagers in the district center of Sangin, where he manned an outpost, seemed to have little allegiance to the Afghan government in Kabul or the American vision of democracy.\u201cWe had no idea what our mission was, even back then,\u201d said Mr. Wood, who now runs the nationwide veteran volunteering network Team Rubicon. \u201cWere we trying to defeat the Taliban?

That was in 2008.Mr. Mackey, an Army Special Forces soldier, deployed there five more times, was shot twice, and, he said, grew more cynical on each trip, until he decided the only sensible thing for the United States to do was cut its losses and leave.Even so, seeing the swift and chaotic collapse of the Afghan government in recent days hit him with the intensity of a bomb blast.\u201cIt\u2019s pain \u2014 pain I thought I had gotten used to,\u201d said Mr. Mackey, who retired as a sergeant first class in 2018 and now lives in Florida. \u201cI sacrificed a lot, I saw death every year. And the guys I served with, we knew it would probably come to an end like this. But to see it end in chaos, it makes us angry. After everything we gave, I just wish there had been a way to leave with honor.\u201dIn the 20 years that the United States military was in Afghanistan, more than 775,000 American troops deployed there, to citylike air bases and sandbag outposts on lonely mountaintops. As the Taliban swept into Kabul on Sunday, wiping away any gains made, veterans said in interviews that they watched with a roiling mix of sadness, rage and relief. Some were thankful that America\u2019s involvement in the country seemed to have ended, but were also dismayed that hard-won progress was squandered. Others were fearful for Afghan friends left behind.In interviews, text messages and on Facebook, men and women who collectively spent decades in Afghanistan said they were angry that despite a drawdown that has spanned years, the United States could not manage to exit the country with more dignity.The anguish can be especially raw because veterans often worked side by side with Afghans during the years of attempts at nation-building, and now in that nation\u2019s collapse they see the individual faces of friends who have been enveloped by the anarchy.\u201cMy heart breaks for the Afghan people,\u201d said Ginger Wallace, a retired Air Force colonel who in 2012 oversaw a program that retrained low-level Taliban fighters to clear land mines and work in other jobs that offered an alternative to combat.At the time, she thought that efforts to stabilize Afghanistan were succeeding, and that American troops would one day leave the country a better place. But her optimism slowly wore down as the Taliban gained ground.\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking, absolutely. I hate to see it end like this, but you don\u2019t know what else we could have done,\u201d she said in an interview from her home in Louisville, Ky. \u201cDo we have an expectation that U.S. service members should stay and fight the Taliban when the Afghan Army won\u2019t?\u201dMs. Wallace met her wife, Janet Holliday, while deployed in Afghanistan. The two normally watch the news each morning, but on Monday, as scenes of mayhem unfolded at the airport in Kabul, Ms. Holliday, a retired Army colonel, switched to the Food Channel.\u201cIt was too hard to watch,\u201d Ms. Holliday said, excusing herself as she became upset. \u201cI just can\u2019t help thinking about what a waste it is. I can\u2019t allow myself to think about how after all that blood and treasure, it ends like this.\u201dMore than with other wars in the nation\u2019s history, Americans have been mostly insulated from the fighting in Afghanistan. There was no draft or mass mobilization. Less than 1 percent of the nation served and a disproportionate number of troops came from rural counties in the South and West, far from the seats of power.But veterans have said in interviews over the years that they were cleareyed about the challenges posed by the war, perhaps more so than the rest of the nation. They saw firsthand the deeply ingrained traditional cultures, tribal allegiances and endemic corruption that continually hobbled American efforts.Mr. Mackey agreed with President Biden\u2019s decision to withdraw, but thought the way it was done was slapdash and unprofessional.\u201cWe train to have contingencies. The way it was handled was just irresponsible,\u201d Mr. Mackey said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to have another Vietnam, we wanted to do better.\u201dJake Wood was a 25-year-old Marine sniper deployed to a forgotten corner of Afghanistan in 2008 when he started to see how much daylight there was between the optimistic pronouncements of top American leaders and the reality of serving with Afghans on the ground.Villagers in the district center of Sangin, where he manned an outpost, seemed to have little allegiance to the Afghan government in Kabul or the American vision of democracy.\u201cWe had no idea what our mission was, even back then,\u201d said Mr. Wood, who now runs the nationwide veteran volunteering network Team Rubicon. \u201cWere we trying to defeat the Taliban? Were we nation-building? I don\u2019t think we knew.\u201dThe Afghans he served with seemed to accept the uncertainty with a weary fatalism foreign to young Marines. At one point over small cups of tea, he said, he spoke with a young Afghan he served with who said Afghanistan only knows war, and when the American war ended, another would come.\u201cHe told me that maybe the Americans would come back,\u201d Mr. Wood said. Then he recalled the Afghan saying, \u201cBut if you do, I can\u2019t tell you if we\u2019ll be friends or enemies.\u201dMr. Wood said the veterans he has been in touch with feel a mix of sadness and fury watching the fall of Kabul: sadness that the folly that seemed so obvious in the ranks took years and thousands of lives for top leaders to accept; fury that the result of that ignorance and hubris was playing out on cable television in a way that would tarnish the reputation of the nation and the hundreds of thousands of troops who fought.\u201cWe already knew we were losing the war,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now we are losing it live on TV in front of the rest of the world. That\u2019s what\u2019s so hard.\u201d",

    "context": "As travelers prepare for their next vacation, among the essentials to take along \u2014 like a toothbrush, wallet and phone charger \u2014 could be proof of vaccination for Covid-19, depending on where they are booked to sleep.As coronavirus cases surge again across the country, driven by the highly contagious Delta variant, a small number of hotels in the United States have announced that they will require proof of vaccination from guests and staff.Accommodations such as PUBLIC Hotel, Equinox Hotel and Wythe Hotel, all in New York City, Urban Cowboy Lodge in Big Indian, N.Y., a hamlet in the Catskill Mountains, and Pilgrim House in Provincetown, Mass., are among the first in the United States to announce that they will require evidence of vaccination, via a physical card or a digital verification, from their guests.The precedent for hotels requiring vaccination is already being set beyond the contiguous United States. In August, Puerto Rico issued an island-wide vaccine mandate that requires guests and staff at all hotels, guesthouses and short-term rentals, including Airbnb, to provide proof of vaccination or a negative PCR or antigen test taken within 72 hours before their visit. If a person is staying longer than a week, they will need to present negative tests to hotel staff on a weekly basis.Elite Island Resorts, a Florida-based company that runs a collection of all-inclusive Caribbean resorts stretching from Antigua to Panama, announced that all guests over the age of 12 would be required to show proof of Covid-19 vaccination upon arrival beginning on Sept. 1.\u201cIt\u2019s imperative for us to protect the hospitals of these smaller island nations, and while they have had a good track record so far with Covid-19, we must remain vigilant, and all do our part to become part of the solution,\u201d wrote Robert A. Barrett, the founder and chief executive of Elite Island Resorts, in the company\u2019s announcement.Although European destinations are rolling out various vaccine mandates, hotels are mostly not requiring proof of immunization. In Portugal, however, hotel guests need to show proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test.In the United States, PUBLIC Hotel, a boutique accommodation on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side owned by the hotel magnate Ian Schrager, earlier this month became one of the country\u2019s first hotels to mandate proof of vaccination from its guests and staff. The requirement will begin on Sept. 5, with only medical and religious exemptions.\u201cWe need to beat Covid-19 together,\u201d Mr. Schrager said in a news release that announced his decision. \u201cAfter all, looking after people is our business. We just didn\u2019t see how to fulfill this responsibility without taking action.\u201dAt Equinox Hotel New York, the first hotel by the luxury fitness company, guests will be required to show proof of first vaccination from Sept. 13. Equinox is also requiring on-site staff to be vaccinated.\u201cEquinox Hotels has always and will continue to listen to infectious disease experts as well as local governments to guide our decision making,\u201d said Chris Norton, the chief executive of Equinox Hotels, in an email.The American Hotel and Lodging Association, an industry trade group, issued safety guidelines based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which includes encouraging employees to get vaccinated.\u201cA.H.L.A. urges everyone who is eligible to be vaccinated as soon as possible, including industry employees,\u201d said Chip Rogers, president and chief executive of the association.While industry leaders may be encouraging vaccination, some hospitality experts aren\u2019t convinced that there will be a widespread movement of hotels requiring vaccination.\u201cAt the current stage, I don\u2019t think we will see broad vaccine requirements by hotels,\u201d said Christopher K. Anderson, a professor at the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration.\u201cAt present not even all major hotel brands are requiring their employees to be vaccinated \u2014 let alone guests,\u201d Mr. Anderson said in an email.

    "context": "WASHINGTON \u2014 With the Aug. 31 deadline for a U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan rapidly approaching, the Pentagon has sharply ramped up the speed of evacuations from the Kabul airport, flying out 21,600 people in 24 hours, Defense Department officials said Tuesday. But bottlenecks in the system, and President Biden\u2019s insistence that all troops leave the country by the end of the month, may prevent the military from keeping that pace.The race against time means that the 5,800 Marines and soldiers at Hamid Karzai International Airport must try to evacuate thousands more Americans and Afghan allies, and then get themselves out, somehow erasing the detritus of 20 years of war in Afghanistan in the next seven days.That process began on Tuesday, as John F. Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said that several hundred headquarters, maintenance and other support troops who were not essential to the escalating evacuation operation had left the country.Defense officials have been loath to say publicly, though, what seems increasingly clear: Some people will be left behind.Since Aug. 14, when Kabul fell to the Taliban, more than 70,700 people have been evacuated from Afghanistan as of Tuesday evening, Mr. Biden said.That is well below the number of American citizens, foreign nationals and Afghan allies who are trying to get out. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get as many out as we can,\u201d said Mr. Kirby. He said the American troops at the Kabul airport want to \u201ccontinue this pace as aggressively as we can.\u201dBut for all of Mr. Biden\u2019s insistence on sticking to his withdrawal deadline, neither the Department of Homeland Security nor the State Department has been able to ratchet up the vetting and processing times to the levels needed to meet demand.A U.S. official said it was taking as long as 12 hours for immigration officers at Al Udeid Air Base outside Doha, Qatar, to check arriving Afghans against the National Counterterrorism Center\u2019s watch list. The official said that vetting and screening processes needed to move faster to prevent the evacuee pipeline from clogging up again at Al Udeid, the largest base receiving Afghans, as it did for several hours last week.The Taliban have warned of \u201cconsequences\u201d if the U.S. military stays beyond the deadline. And on Tuesday, a Taliban spokesman said the group\u2019s fighters would physically block Afghans from going to the airport.The Pentagon has opened military bases in Virginia, Texas, Wisconsin and New Jersey to provide temporary housing for Afghan refugees, and will probably add more in the coming days, officials said.Mr. Kirby said Afghan allies of the United States, who fear reprisals from the Taliban, are still being processed at the Kabul airport, although the gates of the airport have been shuttered several times over the past week because of the surge of people.The United States will continue to evacuate Afghans until the last couple of days of its drawdown of troops and equipment, when flights are expected to be filled mostly with military troops and equipment, as well as any Americans desiring to leave. Dozens of Afghan commandos \u2014 trained by the United States \u2014 are also at the airport and must be evacuated.For the military, part of the problem is the sheer scale of moving so many people so quickly, with so little advanced notice. For instance, the C-17 military planes, which are transporting 400 people per load, have one or two bathrooms on them, and the flight from Kabul to Qatar is four hours.Once the flights arrive at Al Udeid in Qatar and other intermediate bases in the Middle East and Europe, evacuees are vetted by Homeland Security and State Department officials, who determine if they qualify to enter the United States.The military is treating the Taliban\u2019s red line on Aug. 31 seriously in part because, despite tough talk from Taliban spokesmen, some of the group\u2019s commanders have been cooperating with the U.S. military and allowing many people to get to the airport. In addition, the American military and the Taliban have cooperated against the threat of attacks from the Islamic State.But after Aug. 31, all bets are off, a senior U.S. official said.With so many people at the Kabul airport, in Doha and at other bases, concerns are rising about sanitation, food and water. The C-17 planes taking refugees out of Afghanistan are turning around and bringing in extra dumpsters, portable hand-washing stations, refrigerated trucks to keep water cool, and food and water.Over the past four days, Defense Department officials said, three babies were born to evacuees. One woman went into labor on Saturday during a flight landing at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, Air Force officials said. The aircraft commander descended to a lower altitude to increase air pressure in the jet, a decision that officials said saved the mother\u2019s life because she had low blood pressure. When the plane landed, medics rushed aboard and delivered the baby \u2014 a girl \u2014 in the cargo bay. All three babies are in good condition, Mr. Kirby said Tuesday.After receiving a classified briefing Monday night, Representative Adam B. Schiff, a California Democrat who heads the House Intelligence Committee, said the Aug. 31 deadline for withdrawing U.S. troops from Kabul was unrealistic.\u201cI think it\u2019s possible, but I think it\u2019s very unlikely,\u201d Mr. Schiff told reporters. Using the abbreviation for special immigrant visas, he added, \u201cGiven the number of Americans who still need to be evacuated, the number of S.I.V.s, the number of others who are members of the Afghan press, civil society leaders, women leaders \u2014 it\u2019s hard for me to imagine all of that can be accomplished between now and the end of the month.\u201d",

Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said that several hundred headquarters, maintenance and other support troops who were not essential to the escalating evacuation operation had left the country.Defense officials have been loath to say publicly, though, what seems increasingly clear: Some people will be left behind.Since Aug. 14, when Kabul fell to the Taliban, more than 70,700 people have been evacuated from Afghanistan as of Tuesday evening, Mr. Biden said.That is well below the number of American citizens, foreign nationals and Afghan allies who are trying to get out. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get as many out as we can,\u201d said Mr. Kirby. He said the American troops at the Kabul airport want to \u201ccontinue this pace as aggressively as we can.\u201dBut for all of Mr. Biden\u2019s insistence on sticking to his withdrawal deadline, neither the Department of Homeland Security nor the State Department has been able to ratchet up the vetting and processing times to the levels needed to meet demand.A U.S. official said it was taking as long as 12 hours for immigration officers at Al Udeid Air Base outside Doha, Qatar, to check arriving Afghans against the National Counterterrorism Center\u2019s watch list. The official said that vetting and screening processes needed to move faster to prevent the evacuee pipeline from clogging up again at Al Udeid, the largest base receiving Afghans, as it did for several hours last week.The Taliban have warned of \u201cconsequences\u201d if the U.S. military stays beyond the deadline. And on Tuesday, a Taliban spokesman said the group\u2019s fighters would physically block Afghans from going to the airport.The Pentagon has opened military bases in Virginia, Texas, Wisconsin and New Jersey to provide temporary housing for Afghan refugees, and will probably add more in the coming days, officials said.Mr. Kirby said Afghan allies of the United States, who fear reprisals from the Taliban, are still being processed at the Kabul airport, although the gates of the airport have been shuttered several times over the past week because of the surge of people.The United States will continue to evacuate Afghans until the last couple of days of its drawdown of troops and equipment, when flights are expected to be filled mostly with military troops and equipment, as well as any Americans desiring to leave. Dozens of Afghan commandos \u2014 trained by the United States \u2014 are also at the airport and must be evacuated.For the military, part of the problem is the sheer scale of moving so many people so quickly, with so little advanced notice. For instance, the C-17 military planes, which are transporting 400 people per load, have one or two bathrooms on them, and the flight from Kabul to Qatar is four hours.Once the flights arrive at Al Udeid in Qatar and other intermediate bases in the Middle East and Europe, evacuees are vetted by Homeland Security and State Department officials, who determine if they qualify to enter the United States.The military is treating the Taliban\u2019s red line on Aug. 31 seriously in part because, despite tough talk from Taliban spokesmen, some of the group\u2019s commanders have been cooperating with the U.S. military and allowing many people to get to the airport. In addition, the American military and the Taliban have cooperated against the threat of attacks from the Islamic State.But after Aug. 31, all bets are off, a senior U.S. official said.With so many people at the Kabul airport, in Doha and at other bases, concerns are rising about sanitation, food and water. The C-17 planes taking refugees out of Afghanistan are turning around and bringing in extra dumpsters, portable hand-washing stations, refrigerated trucks to keep water cool, and food and water.Over the past four days, Defense Department officials said, three babies were born to evacuees. One woman went into labor on Saturday during a flight landing at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, Air Force officials said. The aircraft commander descended to a lower altitude to increase air pressure in the jet, a decision that officials said saved the mother\u2019s life because she had low blood pressure. When the plane landed, medics rushed aboard and delivered the baby \u2014 a girl \u2014 in the cargo bay. All three babies are in good condition, Mr. Kirby said Tuesday.After receiving a classified briefing Monday night, Representative Adam B. Schiff, a California Democrat who heads the House Intelligence Committee, said the Aug. 31 deadline for withdrawing U.S. troops from Kabul was unrealistic.\u201cI think it\u2019s possible, but I think it\u2019s very unlikely,\u201d Mr. Schiff told reporters. Using the abbreviation for special immigrant visas, he added, \u201cGiven the number of Americans who still need to be evacuated, the number of S.I.V.s, the number of others who are members of the Afghan press, civil society leaders, women leaders \u2014 it\u2019s hard for me to imagine all of that can be accomplished between now and the end of the month.\u201d",

Mr. Hambali, who is Indonesian, is accused of allying himself with Osama bin Laden\u2019s global jihad, and sending Mr. Bin Amin and Mr. Bin Lep, former architecture students who met in college in Malaysia, to train in Qaeda camps in Afghanistan.Translation and technical issues were evident at the outset. One lawyer pointed out that a prisoner had mentioned \u201cGoogle\u201d in a remark in Malay for the judge, but the court interpreter did not mention the search engine in an English translation. The Indonesian translator turned \u201clegal training\u201d in English into \u201ctraining legal\u201d in Bahasa Indonesian.Defense lawyers said with alarm that all three defendants recognized a \u201cMr. Singh,\u201d a translator with whom they each had confidential conversations as they prepared to seek release through a review board hearing, sitting beside the lead prosecutor in court on Monday, now working for the prosecution.Lawyers for the three prisoners also told the judge that the court\u2019s official Indonesian translator had in 2020 offered the opinion that \u201cthe government is wasting money on these terrorists; they should have been killed a long time ago,\u201d and added that they had a sworn affidavit from a witness who heard the remark. Prosecutors are seeking life sentences in the case.Mr. Bin Lep\u2019s lawyer, Brian Bouffard, declared the Indonesian American contract translator \u201cirretrievably biased.\u201d Mr. Bin Amin\u2019s lawyer, Christine Funk, questioned why the prosecutors needed an interpreter at the arraignment hearing in the first place: \u201cAre they spying on us? I don\u2019t know.\u201dThe trial judge, Navy Cmdr. Hayes C. Larsen, tried to mend the problems. He gave the official court translation team 10-minute breaks every 20 minutes. He told defense lawyers to file legal motions if they believed there were interpretation problems that required remedies. And he postponed until Tuesday the reading of the charges, which was the reason for Monday\u2019s hearing.Defense lawyers, both civilian and military, and all paid by the Pentagon, described the case as still in its infancy. Prosecutors, they said, had provided perhaps 2 percent of the pretrial documents that could be used in the case, including accounts of interrogations the F.B.I. did in 2007 with the prisoners soon after their transfer to military custody from the C.I.A. Prosecutors declined to comment.Mr. Hambali\u2019s lawyer, James R. Hodes, called the case \u201cabsurd,\u201d in part because of the length of his client\u2019s detention and the nearly two-decade delay in bringing charges against him. He told reporters before the hearing that Mr. Hambali had been \u201cbrutalized\u201d and spent at least half of his detention in solitary confinement. He said the prisoner was owed \u201can apology\u201d and repatriation, \u201cnot to be held in a cage in a Caribbean island.\u201dHearings at Guant\u00e1namo have been mostly held between English and Arabic, but have also suffered translation problems.

The Senate study of the C.I.A.\u2019s interrogation program cited a January 2004 cable from a secret detention site that reported that Mr. Bin Lep\u2019s \u201cEnglish is very poor, and we do not have a Malay linguist.\u201d",

In August, Puerto Rico issued an island-wide vaccine mandate that requires guests and staff at all hotels, guesthouses and short-term rentals, including Airbnb, to provide proof of vaccination or a negative PCR or antigen test taken within 72 hours before their visit. If a person is staying longer than a week, they will need to present negative tests to hotel staff on a weekly basis.Elite Island Resorts, a Florida-based company that runs a collection of all-inclusive Caribbean resorts stretching from Antigua to Panama, announced that all guests over the age of 12 would be required to show proof of Covid-19 vaccination upon arrival beginning on Sept. 1.\u201cIt\u2019s imperative for us to protect the hospitals of these smaller island nations, and while they have had a good track record so far with Covid-19, we must remain vigilant, and all do our part to become part of the solution,\u201d wrote Robert A. Barrett, the founder and chief executive of Elite Island Resorts, in the company\u2019s announcement.Although European destinations are rolling out various vaccine mandates, hotels are mostly not requiring proof of immunization. In Portugal, however, hotel guests need to show proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test.In the United States, PUBLIC Hotel, a boutique accommodation on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side owned by the hotel magnate Ian Schrager, earlier this month became one of the country\u2019s first hotels to mandate proof of vaccination from its guests and staff. The requirement will begin on Sept. 5, with only medical and religious exemptions.\u201cWe need to beat Covid-19 together,\u201d Mr. Schrager said in a news release that announced his decision. \u201cAfter all, looking after people is our business. We just didn\u2019t see how to fulfill this responsibility without taking action.\u201dAt Equinox Hotel New York, the first hotel by the luxury fitness company, guests will be required to show proof of first vaccination from Sept. 13. Equinox is also requiring on-site staff to be vaccinated.\u201cEquinox Hotels has always and will continue to listen to infectious disease experts as well as local governments to guide our decision making,\u201d said Chris Norton, the chief executive of Equinox Hotels, in an email.The American Hotel and Lodging Association, an industry trade group, issued safety guidelines based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which includes encouraging employees to get vaccinated.\u201cA.H.L.A. urges everyone who is eligible to be vaccinated as soon as possible, including industry employees,\u201d said Chip Rogers, president and chief executive of the association.While industry leaders may be encouraging vaccination, some hospitality experts aren\u2019t convinced that there will be a widespread movement of hotels requiring vaccination.\u201cAt the current stage, I don\u2019t think we will see broad vaccine requirements by hotels,\u201d said Christopher K.

    "context": "Few people in Congress have stood as alone as Representative Barbara Lee did on Sept. 14, 2001. Three days earlier, the United States had endured the most devastating attack ever on its soil. Now Congress was called on to authorize the unleashing of American military power against Al Qaeda and its Taliban enablers in Afghanistan who were held responsible for what has eternally come to be called 9/11.In the House, 420 members voted to give the president that authority. The Senate agreed, 98-0. Only one lawmaker said no: Ms. Lee, a Democrat representing a district centered on Oakland and Berkeley, Calif. Her vote brought angry denunciations and even physical threats.\u201cPeople were calling me a traitor \u2014 \u2018she\u2019s got to go,\u2019 \u201d she told Retro Report. \u201cBut I knew then that it was going to set the stage for perpetual war.\u201dThat is exactly what it did.But after 20 years, that perpetual war has finally ended. With the United States-supported Afghan government gone and the Taliban once again in control, Ms. Lee is no longer a lonely skeptical voice in Washington, doubting America\u2019s capacity to reshape a distant and often hostile land. Lessons from the Afghanistan experience form the core of the accompanying video from Retro Report, whose mission is to examine the enduring impact of past events on present policies.A stiff measure of humility is in order, suggested Richard A. Boucher, who was the assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian Affairs during the administration of President George W. Bush.\u201cYou can\u2019t remake a country on the American image,\u201d Mr. Boucher said to Retro Report. \u201cYou can\u2019t win when you\u2019re fighting people for their own villages and their own territory. Those were lessons we thought we learned in Vietnam. And yet, 30 or 40 years later, we end up in Afghanistan repeating the same mistakes.\u201dHumility was not a hallmark of United States policy in Afghanistan, even though Mr. Bush and his advisers understood that the country was called \u201cthe graveyard of empires\u201d for good reason. Britain had a misadventure there in the 19th century. The Soviet Union had its own in the late 20th century. Somehow, Mr. Bush thought 21st-century America would be different.Addressing cadets at the Virginia Military Institute in April 2002, a few months after United States-led troops had routed the Taliban, Mr. Bush offered a vision of an Afghanistan reconstituted with Washington\u2019s guiding hand, much as devastated Europe had been after World War II through the Marshall Plan. \u201cTrue peace,\u201d he said, would not result from military force alone but rather from new networks of roads, hospitals and schools.Mr. Bush said he understood the history of military conflict in Afghanistan. \u201cIt\u2019s been one of initial success, followed by long years of floundering and ultimate failure,\u201d he said. But he added, with a fleeting, confident smile, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to repeat that mistake.\u201dMistakes, obviously, were nonetheless made. Among them, in the judgment of many analysts, was the Bush administration\u2019s expansion of its \u201cwar on terror\u201d to Iraq. And as the years passed, it became evident that the Afghan leaders on whom Washington had placed big bets would not be the hoped-for instruments of effective, corruption-free governance.\u201cI used to say to my guys on the Afghan desk, \u2018If we\u2019re winning, how come it don\u2019t look like we\u2019re winning?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Boucher told Retro Report.To complicate matters, the Taliban never disappeared. Slowly at first, and then with stunning speed, they regained control.\u201cThe people were not rejecting the Taliban,\u201d Mr. Boucher said. \u201cThat was, in the end, because the government couldn\u2019t deliver much for the people.\u201dWell before recent weeks, he said, \u201cwe should have at least asked ourselves whether it wasn\u2019t really time for us to leave, to say to the Afghans, \u2018It\u2019s your place. You run it as best as you can.\u2019\u201dNow the world is left to wonder whether the relatively moderate image that Taliban leaders have sought to project in recent days should be taken seriously. Or will they, instead, revert to the thuggery of the past, with dissidents killed, ancient monuments leveled, women denied jobs and compelled to wear burqas, and girls forced to leave school?What lasting lessons the United States has learned remain similarly unclear. For one thing, the congressional vote in 2001 that gave the president open-ended license to use military force is still in force; it has been used as a basis for the deployment of American soldiers to Ethiopia, Somalia, Yemen and many other countries.Across the years, Representative Lee has introduced legislation to revoke this blanket authorization for the White House. She managed to succeed in the House in 2019, but the effort then failed in the Senate.Her view 20 years ago, she told Retro Report, was that \u201cwe need to think through our military response, our national security response, and the possible impact on civilians.\u201dOn that score, she seems unchanged from when she rose in Congress in 2001 to say: \u201cHowever difficult this vote may be, some of us must urge the use of restraint. Our country is in a state of mourning. Some of us must say, \u2018Let\u2019s step back for a moment, let\u2019s just pause, just for a minute, and think through the implications of our actions today, so that this does not spiral out of control.\u2019\u201dAt the time, \u201csome of us\u201d ended up being \u201cone of us\u201d \u2014 just her.",

    "context": "Overweight adults should be screened for Type 2 diabetes and abnormally high blood sugar levels starting at age 35, five years earlier than currently advised, an expert task force recommended on Tuesday.The new recommendation, which does not apply to pregnant women, comes amid cresting rates of obesity and diabetes in the United States. It means that more than 40 percent of the adult population should now be screened, according to one estimate.The guideline was issued by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which makes recommendations for preventive services and screenings that insurance companies must completely cover, without out of pocket costs to the insured, under the Affordable Care Act.The task force\u2019s recommendation and a summary of the latest scientific evidence were published on Tuesday in the journal JAMA.Nearly one in seven American adults now has diabetes, the highest rate on record, a recent study found. There has been little improvement over the past decade in patients\u2019 ability to manage the condition, keeping in check their blood sugar levels, blood pressure and cholesterol.The increase is especially troubling amid the pandemic, as diabetes is one of the chronic medical conditions that increase the risk that a coronavirus infection will lead to severe illness, hospitalization or even death.Diabetes is linked to heart disease and liver disease, and it is the leading cause of kidney failure and new blindness in adults. The condition can lead to limb amputation, nerve damage and other complications.The task force said health care providers should consider screening some individuals even earlier than age 35 if they are at heightened risk. Those include people with a family history of diabetes or a personal history of conditions like gestational diabetes, and people who are Black, Hispanic, Native American, Alaska Native or Asian American.All of these groups have higher rates of diabetes than white Americans.\u201cThe Covid epidemic is really important, but we also have an epidemic of diabetes and pre-diabetes driven by the epidemic of obesity and lack of exercise,\u201d said Dr. Michael J. Barry, the vice chair of the task force who directs the informed medical decisions program at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. \u201cAll these conditions that we\u2019ve lived with for years are still out there.\u201dAbout one-third of U.S. adults have high blood sugar levels, a condition called pre-diabetes that often precedes Type 2 diabetes and can progress to full blown disease. Most are unaware they have the condition, which doesn\u2019t produce obvious symptoms and is why screening is essential, Dr. Barry said.Being overweight or obese is the most important risk factor for the most common type of diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, and for pre-diabetes. Lifestyle changes \u2014 including increasing physical activity, eating a healthier diet and losing even a modest amount of weight \u2014 can prevent the progression from pre-diabetes to full diabetes. (Drug treatment is also an option.)Screening generally involves a blood test to determine whether blood sugar (or glucose) is elevated. The task force called for lowering the age of first screening to 35 because that is when the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes starts to inch upward. Screening should be carried out every three years until age 70, the task force said.Dr. Tannaz Moin, an endocrinologist who co-wrote an editorial accompanying the new recommendations, said that lowering the age for screening was a step in the right direction, and that she was pleased that the guidelines emphasized the importance of detecting pre-diabetes.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more recognition that pre-diabetes is a big problem that often flies under the radar,\u201d she said. It is critical to detect pre-diabetes in younger adults, because they may live with diabetes for a long time if they develop it at a relatively young age, and will be at a greater risk of developing complications.Intensive lifestyle interventions that focus on moderate weight loss and include 150 minutes of physical activity per week can prevent or delay the onset of Type 2 diabetes in overweight or obese people with pre-diabetes. A drug, metformin, is also an option but is not as beneficial as lifestyle changes.\u201cWe have really good evidence that we can delay the onset of Type 2 diabetes if we get individuals who have pre-diabetes to do something about their risk,\u201d Dr. Moin said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same for people with Type 2 diabetes: Once we know they have it, we have a whole toolbox of things we can offer them.\u201dRates of diabetes and pre-diabetes have increased in recent years among younger populations, including children and teenagers. Studies have shown that almost one in four adults ages 18 to 44 has pre-diabetes.Another study published on Tuesday in JAMA reported that the prevalence of both Type 1 diabetes, often called juvenile diabetes, and Type 2 diabetes, which generally starts later in life, increased in children and teenagers from 2001 to 2017, with the greatest increases among those ages 16 and over.The rate of Type 2 diabetes nearly doubled, to 0.67 per 1,000 Americans ages 10 to 19 in 2017 from 0.34 per 1,000 young people in 2001. The greatest increases were reported among Black and Hispanic youngsters.The incidence of Type 1 diabetes also increased, to 2.15 per 1,000 children and teenagers under age 19 in 2017 from 1.48 per 1,000 in 2001, with the greatest increases among white and Black children and teenagers.",

    "context": "Overweight adults should be screened for Type 2 diabetes and abnormally high blood sugar levels starting at age 35, five years earlier than currently advised, an expert task force recommended on Tuesday.The new recommendation, which does not apply to pregnant women, comes amid cresting rates of obesity and diabetes in the United States. It means that more than 40 percent of the adult population should now be screened, according to one estimate.The guideline was issued by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which makes recommendations for preventive services and screenings that insurance companies must completely cover, without out of pocket costs to the insured, under the Affordable Care Act.The task force\u2019s recommendation and a summary of the latest scientific evidence were published on Tuesday in the journal JAMA.Nearly one in seven American adults now has diabetes, the highest rate on record, a recent study found. There has been little improvement over the past decade in patients\u2019 ability to manage the condition, keeping in check their blood sugar levels, blood pressure and cholesterol.The increase is especially troubling amid the pandemic, as diabetes is one of the chronic medical conditions that increase the risk that a coronavirus infection will lead to severe illness, hospitalization or even death.Diabetes is linked to heart disease and liver disease, and it is the leading cause of kidney failure and new blindness in adults. The condition can lead to limb amputation, nerve damage and other complications.The task force said health care providers should consider screening some individuals even earlier than age 35 if they are at heightened risk. Those include people with a family history of diabetes or a personal history of conditions like gestational diabetes, and people who are Black, Hispanic, Native American, Alaska Native or Asian American.All of these groups have higher rates of diabetes than white Americans.\u201cThe Covid epidemic is really important, but we also have an epidemic of diabetes and pre-diabetes driven by the epidemic of obesity and lack of exercise,\u201d said Dr. Michael J. Barry, the vice chair of the task force who directs the informed medical decisions program at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. \u201cAll these conditions that we\u2019ve lived with for years are still out there.\u201dAbout one-third of U.S. adults have high blood sugar levels, a condition called pre-diabetes that often precedes Type 2 diabetes and can progress to full blown disease. Most are unaware they have the condition, which doesn\u2019t produce obvious symptoms and is why screening is essential, Dr. Barry said.Being overweight or obese is the most important risk factor for the most common type of diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, and for pre-diabetes. Lifestyle changes \u2014 including increasing physical activity, eating a healthier diet and losing even a modest amount of weight \u2014 can prevent the progression from pre-diabetes to full diabetes. (Drug treatment is also an option.)Screening generally involves a blood test to determine whether blood sugar (or glucose) is elevated. The task force called for lowering the age of first screening to 35 because that is when the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes starts to inch upward. Screening should be carried out every three years until age 70, the task force said.Dr. Tannaz Moin, an endocrinologist who co-wrote an editorial accompanying the new recommendations, said that lowering the age for screening was a step in the right direction, and that she was pleased that the guidelines emphasized the importance of detecting pre-diabetes.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more recognition that pre-diabetes is a big problem that often flies under the radar,\u201d she said. It is critical to detect pre-diabetes in younger adults, because they may live with diabetes for a long time if they develop it at a relatively young age, and will be at a greater risk of developing complications.Intensive lifestyle interventions that focus on moderate weight loss and include 150 minutes of physical activity per week can prevent or delay the onset of Type 2 diabetes in overweight or obese people with pre-diabetes. A drug, metformin, is also an option but is not as beneficial as lifestyle changes.\u201cWe have really good evidence that we can delay the onset of Type 2 diabetes if we get individuals who have pre-diabetes to do something about their risk,\u201d Dr. Moin said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same for people with Type 2 diabetes: Once we know they have it, we have a whole toolbox of things we can offer them.\u201dRates of diabetes and pre-diabetes have increased in recent years among younger populations, including children and teenagers. Studies have shown that almost one in four adults ages 18 to 44 has pre-diabetes.Another study published on Tuesday in JAMA reported that the prevalence of both Type 1 diabetes, often called juvenile diabetes, and Type 2 diabetes, which generally starts later in life, increased in children and teenagers from 2001 to 2017, with the greatest increases among those ages 16 and over.The rate of Type 2 diabetes nearly doubled, to 0.67 per 1,000 Americans ages 10 to 19 in 2017 from 0.34 per 1,000 young people in 2001. The greatest increases were reported among Black and Hispanic youngsters.The incidence of Type 1 diabetes also increased, to 2.15 per 1,000 children and teenagers under age 19 in 2017 from 1.48 per 1,000 in 2001, with the greatest increases among white and Black children and teenagers.",

They were bracing for an influx of patients at a time when they are already strained by the coronavirus pandemic, which has swept across Louisiana with a renewed fury in recent weeks.

On Saturday, for example, nine patients in the hospital died, and eight of those were Covid-19 patients.Some patients were being kept on stretchers, and the ratio of nurses to patients has expanded.\u201cOur people are stretched, our devices are stretched,\u201d said Catherine O\u2019Neal, the hospital\u2019s chief medical officer. \u201cIt\u2019s not the level of care that we expect from our team or this hospital, but it is the level of care that we have been presented with and we\u2019ll do our best.\u201dThe hospital has received reinforcements from the state and from the U.S. Department of Defense, all supplementing a staff that has been worn thin as the pandemic flared.Hospital officials are expecting patients to be brought in from other facilities in the region that have been severely damaged by the storm. \u201cWe can take on more, we will take on more,\u201d said Stephanie Manson, the hospital\u2019s chief operating officer.Conditions may be less than perfect, she said, but \u201cit\u2019s still a much better situation than where they were.\u201dPublic health officials are also worried about how the hurricane will ultimately affect the pandemic in Louisiana, as people fleeing their homes pack in with relatives or into shelters with conditions conducive to the spread of the virus. Dr. O\u2019Neal said that similar concerns were raised last year after Hurricane Laura hit Southwest Louisiana, but those fears were not realized. \u201cWe were on the downswing when it hit,\u201d she said, \u201cand there was a great deal of testing that went on in those shelters.\u201dBut the outcome might be different this time. \u201cWe know that Delta is different and it\u2019s far more contagious,\u201d Dr. O\u2019Neal said. \u201cBut we have learned to be patient.\u201d",

    "context": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Trade Commission took new aim at Facebook on Thursday, beefing up its accusations that the company was a monopoly that illegally crushed competition, in an attempt to overcome the skepticism of a federal judge who threw out the agency\u2019s original case two months ago.The suit submitted Thursday contains the same overall arguments as the original, saying that Facebook\u2019s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were made to create a \u201cmoat\u201d around its monopoly in social networking and arguing that the social network should be broken up. But the updated suit is nearly twice as long and includes more facts and analysis that the agency says better support the government\u2019s allegations.\u201cFacebook lacked the business acumen and technical talent to survive the transition to mobile,\u201d Holly Vedova, the acting director of the bureau of competition at the agency, said in a statement. \u201cAfter failing to compete with new innovators, Facebook illegally bought or buried them when their popularity became an existential threat.\u201dFacebook responded: \u201cThere was no valid claim that Facebook was a monopolist \u2014 and that has not changed. Our acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were reviewed and cleared many years ago, and our platform policies were lawful.\u201dThe agency had to refile the case after the judge overseeing it said in June that the government had not provided enough evidence that Facebook was a monopoly in social networking. The judge\u2019s decision, and a similar one he made in a case against the company brought by more than 40 states, dealt a stunning blow to regulators\u2019 attempts to rein in Big Tech.His decision presented the first major test for Lina Khan, the F.T.C. chair, who was only days into her role at the time. Ms. Khan represents a wave of new thinking about the industry among administration officials and many lawmakers, arguing that the government needs to take far more aggressive action to stem the power of technology giants like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. President Biden has appointed multiple regulators with similar aims and lawmakers proposed updates to antitrust laws to target the power of technology companies.The criticisms of the first version of the Facebook case levied by the judge, James E. Boasberg of the District Court of the District of Columbia, showed the steep challenges regulators face. Although the companies dominate the markets they are in \u2014 social media, in the case of Facebook \u2014 the courts often look at whether prices are rising as an indication of monopolization. Facebook\u2019s most popular services are free.\u201cNo one who hears the title of the 2010 film \u2018The Social Network\u2019 wonders which company it is about,\u201d Judge Boasberg wrote. \u201cYet, whatever it may mean to the public, \u2018monopoly power\u2019 is a term of art under federal law with a precise economic meaning.\u201d He instructed the F.T.C. to back up claims that Facebook controlled 60 percent of the market for \u201cpersonal social networking\u201d and that it blocked competition.Ms. Khan then faced a choice on how to handle Judge Boasberg\u2019s decision. One option was to drop the case entirely, while another was to expand it with even broader accusations. Instead, she took more of a middle ground, resubmitting the suit with greater detail and a more sweeping narrative of the company and what the agency says is a pattern of anticompetitive behavior since Mark Zuckerberg co-founded it at Harvard in 2004.The revised suit was approved by the commission in a 3-2 vote, with the three Democrats on the commission voting in favor of it and the two Republican members dissenting.In the new complaint, the F.T.C. provides more details to support the government\u2019s claims that Facebook holds a monopoly in social networking. But the public version of the suit had many of the statistics redacted because the numbers are proprietary.The agency said that Facebook \u2014 the company\u2019s biggest service, known inside the company as Facebook Blue \u2014 and Instagram were the leading social networks in the U.S., far ahead of its next biggest competitor, Snapchat.The agency refuted Facebook\u2019s claims that it has many competitors in social networking, instant messaging and entertainment. The agency argued that Facebook\u2019s products were for \u201cpersonal social networking,\u201d distinguishing them from specialized social networks like the professional network LinkedIn or the neighborhood site NextDoor. The F.T.C. added that Facebook\u2019s products also were different from messaging services like Signal and iMessage because users don\u2019t typically use those services to send notes to big groups, nor do they use those services to find contacts.And the agency said Facebook differed from Twitter, YouTube and TikTok because content on those sites were typically created for the public and not directed at specific individuals in a social network.\u201cFacebook has today, and has maintained since 2011, a dominant share of the relevant market for U.S. personal social networking services, as measured using multiple metrics: time spent, daily active users, and monthly active users,\u201d the agency said in its complaint.The F.T.C.\u2019s core argument is that Facebook tried to maintain a monopoly over social networking through its acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. Slow to develop its app for mobile phones, the company sought to \u201cbuy or bury innovators threatening to out-compete Facebook in the new mobile environment,\u201d the agency said in its complaint.The lawsuit also says that, beginning in 2010, the company stifled competitors like Circle, a social network, and Vine, a short-video platform, by adding new limits for how outside developers whose products connected to Facebook could work with other social networks.\u201cFacebook beat competitors not by improving its own product but instead by imposing anticompetitive restrictions on developers,\u201d according to the lawsuit.Facebook has criticized the arguments as revisionist history, noting that the F.T.C. reviewed the mergers with Instagram and WhatsApp and didn\u2019t block the deals.\u201cThe F.T.C.\u2019s claims are an effort to rewrite antitrust laws and upend settled expectations of merger review, declaring to the business community that no sale is ever final,\u201d Facebook said on Thursday.The company has until Oct. 4 to respond to the new complaint or to file for Mr. Boasberg to dismiss the case. Last month, it filed a petition for Ms. Khan to recuse herself from the agency\u2019s case, saying her work on a House investigation into platform monopolies showed a bias against the company. The F.T.C. on Thursday said that it had dismissed that petition, saying that Facebook would receive \u201cthe appropriate constitutional due process protections\u201d because the case would be tried before a federal judge.Bill Kovacic, a former chairman of the F.T.C., said the agency did enough to \u201clive to fight another day.\u201d\u201cThe judge said \u2018show your work,\u2019 and it appears they did enough to satisfy that request,\u201d he said.But he warned the case would face a long and steep challenge. The F.T.C. has won fewer than 20 of its monopoly cases in the appeals court since the agency started more than 100 years ago, he said.\u201cFacebook will fight this ferociously,\u201d Mr. Kovacic added.",

Facebook\u2019s most popular services are free.\u201cNo one who hears the title of the 2010 film \u2018The Social Network\u2019 wonders which company it is about,\u201d Judge Boasberg wrote. \u201cYet, whatever it may mean to the public, \u2018monopoly power\u2019 is a term of art under federal law with a precise economic meaning.\u201d He instructed the F.T.C. to back up claims that Facebook controlled 60 percent of the market for \u201cpersonal social networking\u201d and that it blocked competition.Ms. Khan then faced a choice on how to handle Judge Boasberg\u2019s decision. One option was to drop the case entirely, while another was to expand it with even broader accusations. Instead, she took more of a middle ground, resubmitting the suit with greater detail and a more sweeping narrative of the company and what the agency says is a pattern of anticompetitive behavior since Mark Zuckerberg co-founded it at Harvard in 2004.The revised suit was approved by the commission in a 3-2 vote, with the three Democrats on the commission voting in favor of it and the two Republican members dissenting.In the new complaint, the F.T.C. provides more details to support the government\u2019s claims that Facebook holds a monopoly in social networking. But the public version of the suit had many of the statistics redacted because the numbers are proprietary.The agency said that Facebook \u2014 the company\u2019s biggest service, known inside the company as Facebook Blue \u2014 and Instagram were the leading social networks in the U.S., far ahead of its next biggest competitor, Snapchat.The agency refuted Facebook\u2019s claims that it has many competitors in social networking, instant messaging and entertainment. The agency argued that Facebook\u2019s products were for \u201cpersonal social networking,\u201d distinguishing them from specialized social networks like the professional network LinkedIn or the neighborhood site NextDoor. The F.T.C. added that Facebook\u2019s products also were different from messaging services like Signal and iMessage because users don\u2019t typically use those services to send notes to big groups, nor do they use those services to find contacts.And the agency said Facebook differed from Twitter, YouTube and TikTok because content on those sites were typically created for the public and not directed at specific individuals in a social network.\u201cFacebook has today, and has maintained since 2011, a dominant share of the relevant market for U.S. personal social networking services, as measured using multiple metrics: time spent, daily active users, and monthly active users,\u201d the agency said in its complaint.The F.T.C.\u2019s core argument is that Facebook tried to maintain a monopoly over social networking through its acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. Slow to develop its app for mobile phones, the company sought to \u201cbuy or bury innovators threatening to out-compete Facebook in the new mobile environment,\u201d the agency said in its complaint.The lawsuit also says that, beginning in 2010, the company stifled competitors like Circle, a social network, and Vine, a short-video platform, by adding new limits for how outside developers whose products connected to Facebook could work with other social networks.\u201cFacebook beat competitors not by improving its own product but instead by imposing anticompetitive restrictions on developers,\u201d according to the lawsuit.Facebook has criticized the arguments as revisionist history, noting that the F.T.C. reviewed the mergers with Instagram and WhatsApp and didn\u2019t block the deals.\u201cThe F.T.C.\u2019s claims are an effort to rewrite antitrust laws and upend settled expectations of merger review, declaring to the business community that no sale is ever final,\u201d Facebook said on Thursday.The company has until Oct. 4 to respond to the new complaint or to file for Mr. Boasberg to dismiss the case. Last month, it filed a petition for Ms. Khan to recuse herself from the agency\u2019s case, saying her work on a House investigation into platform monopolies showed a bias against the company. The F.T.C. on Thursday said that it had dismissed that petition, saying that Facebook would receive \u201cthe appropriate constitutional due process protections\u201d because the case would be tried before a federal judge.Bill Kovacic, a former chairman of the F.T.C., said the agency did enough to \u201clive to fight another day.\u201d\u201cThe judge said \u2018show your work,\u2019 and it appears they did enough to satisfy that request,\u201d he said.But he warned the case would face a long and steep challenge. The F.T.C. has won fewer than 20 of its monopoly cases in the appeals court since the agency started more than 100 years ago, he said.\u201cFacebook will fight this ferociously,\u201d Mr. Kovacic added.",
    "question": "4. How does the FTC's revised complaint against Facebook differ from the original one, and what additional details does it provide to support its claims?",
    "point_form_context": "1. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) submitted a new case against Facebook, aiming to prove that the company is a monopoly that illegally crushed competition.\n2. The updated suit contains the same overall arguments as the original case, but includes more facts and analysis to better support the government's allegations.\n3. Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were made to create a \"moat\" around its monopoly in social networking, according to the updated suit.\n4. The FTC argues that Facebook should be broken up, as the social network should be considered a monopoly in the personal social networking market.\n5. Facebook has criticized the FTC's arguments as revisionist history, noting that the FTC reviewed the mergers with Instagram and WhatsApp and didn't block the deals."

    "context": "A group of survivors and descendants of victims of the race massacre in Tulsa, Okla., has asked the Justice Department to take over the search for mass graves of Black residents who were killed during the rampage in 1921.The group, Justice for Greenwood, said it did not trust city officials to lead the search for the graves or to handle any remains that may be found.\u201cTo ensure the deaths of the massacre victims whose remains are found are properly and thoroughly investigated, we are calling on the Department of Justice to act as a neutral, third-party investigator and to take over the search,\u201d the group said in a letter that was signed by the three surviving victims of the massacre, as well as state legislators and community and city leaders.The Justice Department should investigate and \u201cprovide answers and findings that the massacre survivors and their descendants, and the rest of the public, can trust,\u201d they said in the letter, which was dated Friday.A spokeswoman said the Justice Department had received the letter but declined to comment.The city has been working with archaeologists and forensic anthropologists to search for and identify the remains.As many as 300 people died during the rampage, which was led by white looters who set fire to the businesses and homes of Black residents in the Greenwood neighborhood in June 1921. Greenwood, then a booming business district, comprised some 40 blocks of restaurants, hotels and theaters owned and run by Black entrepreneurs. The mob destroyed it in less than 24 hours.A spokeswoman for the city of Tulsa declined to comment on the letter because members of Justice for Greenwood have a pending lawsuit against the city demanding compensation for the losses that descendants of the victims and survivors endured.In 2018, Mayor G.T. Bynum announced that the city would conduct a search for bodies, focusing on four sites, including Oaklawn Cemetery, that had been identified as potential locations of mass graves of the victims.\u201cThe only way to move forward in our work to bring about reconciliation in Tulsa is by seeking the truth honestly,\u201d Mr. Bynum said in a statement posted on the city\u2019s website. \u201cWe are committed to exploring what happened in 1921 through a collective and transparent process.\u201dThe authors of the letter to the Justice Department contended that some of those involved in the search effort, whom they did not name, were the descendants of people who \u201cboth encouraged and actively participated in the violence that destroyed Greenwood in 1921 in the first place.\u201d\u201cThe city has an obvious conflict of interest,\u201d said Damario Solomon-Simmons, the executive director of Justice for Greenwood. \u201cWe do not believe the city has the moral authority or the desire to do the right thing in this situation.\u201dMr. Solomon-Simmons, a lawyer, is representing the three survivors and descendants of the victims in the lawsuit.The massacre followed a chance encounter between two teenagers \u2014 Dick Rowland, 19, a Black shoe shiner, and Sarah Page, 17, a white elevator operator. Mr. Rowland entered the elevator on May 31, 1921. A scream was heard from inside, and Mr. Rowland fled.Accused of sexually assaulting Ms. Page, he was arrested that morning and jailed in the Tulsa County Courthouse. A large group of armed Black people, fearful that Mr. Rowland would be lynched, rushed to the courthouse to ensure his safety.The charges against Mr. Rowland were later dropped, and the authorities eventually concluded that he had most likely tripped and stepped on Ms. Page\u2019s foot, according to a 2001 report from the Oklahoma Commission to Study the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921.But by June 1, the day after the arrest, a large mob of white Tulsans had begun setting fire to businesses in Greenwood. People were killed on the street or simply vanished.No one was ever charged. In the years and decades after the massacre, the city and the Chamber of Commerce tried to cover it up, distorting the narrative to present Black residents as the violent instigators.In June, Kary Stackelbeck, the state archaeologist, led a team that uncovered more than 30 unmarked graves at Oaklawn Cemetery.During a news conference that month, she told reporters that there were no dates or any documentation to help identify the bodies.Nineteen bodies were considered viable enough for a forensic analysis, she said.During the same news conference, Dr. Phoebe Stubblefield, a forensic anthropologist, said that only one of the bodies that had been examined showed signs of trauma \u2014 a Black male who was found with a bullet lodged in his shoulder.She said that the analysis of the bodies was preliminary and that a final report would eventually be presented to the city\u2019s public oversight committee during a public meeting.Dr. Stubblefield said the process of identifying the bodies or figuring out when and how they died was complicated in large part because there was no information about them.\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult project,\u201d Dr. Stubblefield said, adding that the part of the cemetery where the bodies were found was \u201cshockingly underdocumented.\u201dThe body of the man who was found with the bullet was well-preserved, she said, but the remains of the other bodies that had been examined were \u201cbrittle and falling apart,\u201d making it hard to determine signs of trauma.The city reburied the bodies after the analysis, infuriating the survivors and the descendants of the victims, Mr. Solomon-Simmons said.\u201cNone of those bodies have been properly identified,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the uproar.\u201dIn a letter to the City Council, Mr. Bynum said that the bodies had been \u201ctemporarily\u201d reburied as part of a plan that was approved and discussed at public meetings before the exhumation began.He said the goal was to determine whether any of the remains belonged to the victims of the massacre, a process that could take years, and to find available DNA to connect the remains with descendants.\u201cWe have been clear since we began this process a few years ago that the city of Tulsa is in this for the long haul,\u201d Mr. Bynum said. \u201cWhen you start searching for victims nearly a century after they were buried, there are not quick and easy answers.\u201d",

A large group of armed Black people, fearful that Mr. Rowland would be lynched, rushed to the courthouse to ensure his safety.The charges against Mr. Rowland were later dropped, and the authorities eventually concluded that he had most likely tripped and stepped on Ms. Page\u2019s foot, according to a 2001 report from the Oklahoma Commission to Study the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921.But by June 1, the day after the arrest, a large mob of white Tulsans had begun setting fire to businesses in Greenwood. People were killed on the street or simply vanished.No one was ever charged. In the years and decades after the massacre, the city and the Chamber of Commerce tried to cover it up, distorting the narrative to present Black residents as the violent instigators.In June, Kary Stackelbeck, the state archaeologist, led a team that uncovered more than 30 unmarked graves at Oaklawn Cemetery.During a news conference that month, she told reporters that there were no dates or any documentation to help identify the bodies.Nineteen bodies were considered viable enough for a forensic analysis, she said.During the same news conference, Dr. Phoebe Stubblefield, a forensic anthropologist, said that only one of the bodies that had been examined showed signs of trauma \u2014 a Black male who was found with a bullet lodged in his shoulder.She said that the analysis of the bodies was preliminary and that a final report would eventually be presented to the city\u2019s public oversight committee during a public meeting.Dr. Stubblefield said the process of identifying the bodies or figuring out when and how they died was complicated in large part because there was no information about them.\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult project,\u201d Dr. Stubblefield said, adding that the part of the cemetery where the bodies were found was \u201cshockingly underdocumented.\u201dThe body of the man who was found with the bullet was well-preserved, she said, but the remains of the other bodies that had been examined were \u201cbrittle and falling apart,\u201d making it hard to determine signs of trauma.The city reburied the bodies after the analysis, infuriating the survivors and the descendants of the victims, Mr. Solomon-Simmons said.\u201cNone of those bodies have been properly identified,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the uproar.\u201dIn a letter to the City Council, Mr. Bynum said that the bodies had been \u201ctemporarily\u201d reburied as part of a plan that was approved and discussed at public meetings before the exhumation began.He said the goal was to determine whether any of the remains belonged to the victims of the massacre, a process that could take years, and to find available DNA to connect the remains with descendants.\u201cWe have been clear since we began this process a few years ago that the city of Tulsa is in this for the long haul,\u201d Mr. Bynum said. \u201cWhen you start searching for victims nearly a century after they were buried, there are not quick and easy answers.\u201d",
    "question": "4. What is the role of the Justice Department in investigating the 1921 race massacre in Tulsa, Oklahoma?",
    "point_form_context": "1. A group of survivors and descendants of victims of the 1921 race massacre in Tulsa, Oklahoma have asked the Justice Department to take over the search for mass graves of Black residents who were killed during the rampage.\n2. The group, Justice for Greenwood, does not trust city officials to lead the search for the graves or to handle any remains that may be found.\n3. The Justice Department should investigate and provide answers and findings that the massacre survivors and their descendants, and the rest of the public, can trust.\n4. The city of Tulsa has been working with archaeologists and forensic anthropologists to search for and identify the remains.\n5. As many as 300 people died during the rampage, which was led by white looters who set fire to the businesses and homes of Black residents in the Greenwood neighborhood in June 1921."

    "context": "A wildfire that had burned through remote areas in the Sierra Nevada for two weeks crested a ridge on Monday and began descending toward the major population centers along Lake Tahoe.As the Caldor fire intensified amid dry and windy conditions, thousands of people along the lake\u2019s southern and western shores were ordered to evacuate. Crews of firefighters sped to put out spot fires only miles from South Lake Tahoe, Calif.Tourists normally swarm the lake on the California-Nevada border in the summer months for boating, fishing, hiking, eating and drinking. But by sunset on Monday, the community seemed to stand still.On streets that were clogged only hours earlier, shops and businesses \u2014 motels, restaurants, supermarkets \u2014 were deserted. Roads were empty except for fire engines and television reporters documenting the eerie calm.It was impossible to know when, if at all, the fire would reach the town. But people did not stay to test the fury of a blaze that fire officials estimate could threaten more than 20,000 structures.Public safety officials warned that the Caldor fire, the latest to grip California during a particularly unforgiving summer for fire crews in the West, showed no signs of relenting. It had scorched more than 186,000 acres and was 15 percent contained on Monday.The mandatory evacuation zone extended from Tahoma, Calif., on the western shore of the lake, to the Nevada border. \u201cIt was a tense few moments, I think, for our citizens in South Lake Tahoe today,\u201d David Stevenson, the city\u2019s police chief, said during a news conference on Monday evening.Beginning on Tuesday, almost all national forests in California will be closed through Sept. 17 for public safety reasons. The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning for the northern Sierra Nevada and the southern Cascades, meaning that extremely dry conditions and wind gusts of up to 35 miles per hour were likely to cause wildfires to spread in the mountains.The warning will remain in effect until 11 p.m. on Wednesday for the area, which was cloaked in haze on Monday. Smoke from the fire had deteriorated the air quality to unhealthy levels, the U.S. Forest Service said.Firefighters on Monday were battling blazes along a dozen-mile section of an old Pony Express route that connects Gold Rush towns along the thickly forested western slope of the Sierra Nevada. At points, crews drew water from the American River to extinguish spot fires and protect the cabins dotted along Highway 50.Even at 5,000 feet of elevation, temperatures in the midafternoon were in the 90s, unusually hot for the Sierra. Patches of fire burned on both sides of the road.In the heart of the fire, the skies were orange and the valleys a dense slate of impenetrable smoke.Along the granite cliffs that descend to the Lake Tahoe basin, firefighters chased down a spot fire that had ignited on the slopes in the direction of South Lake Tahoe. Firefighters and city officials had hoped that the wall of granite would serve as a protective shield for the communities along Lake Tahoe. But winds carried embers that leaped down the cliffs.Many evacuees grappled with bumper-to-bumper traffic after several major roads in the area were closed. Photographs showed cars at a standstill on Highway 50, the main artery along the southeastern shoreline of the lake.Chief Stevenson said he had been stuck for about three and a half hours on Highway 50 on Monday.\u201cI\u2019m so appreciative that our citizens listened to the warning and the order, and evacuated the city,\u201d he said.The lake, which is known for its sapphire waters and evergreen-surrounded coves, is particularly popular with vacationers from the Bay Area.

But people did not stay to test the fury of a blaze that fire officials estimate could threaten more than 20,000 structures.Public safety officials warned that the Caldor fire, the latest to grip California during a particularly unforgiving summer for fire crews in the West, showed no signs of relenting.

The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning for the northern Sierra Nevada and the southern Cascades, meaning that extremely dry conditions and wind gusts of up to 35 miles per hour were likely to cause wildfires to spread in the mountains.The warning will remain in effect until 11 p.m. on Wednesday for the area, which was cloaked in haze on Monday. Smoke from the fire had deteriorated the air quality to unhealthy levels, the U.S. Forest Service said.Firefighters on Monday were battling blazes along a dozen-mile section of an old Pony Express route that connects Gold Rush towns along the thickly forested western slope of the Sierra Nevada. At points, crews drew water from the American River to extinguish spot fires and protect the cabins dotted along Highway 50.Even at 5,000 feet of elevation, temperatures in the midafternoon were in the 90s, unusually hot for the Sierra. Patches of fire burned on both sides of the road.In the heart of the fire, the skies were orange and the valleys a dense slate of impenetrable smoke.Along the granite cliffs that descend to the Lake Tahoe basin, firefighters chased down a spot fire that had ignited on the slopes in the direction of South Lake Tahoe. Firefighters and city officials had hoped that the wall of granite would serve as a protective shield for the communities along Lake Tahoe. But winds carried embers that leaped down the cliffs.Many evacuees grappled with bumper-to-bumper traffic after several major roads in the area were closed.

It is home to several famous ski resorts and casinos, which are just over the border from South Lake Tahoe in Stateline, Nev. Several concerts that had been scheduled for this week at Harveys Lake Tahoe casino were postponed because of the fire threat.Although wildfires occur throughout the West every year, scientists see the influence of climate change in the extreme heat waves that have contributed to the intensity of fires this summer.

Now, after the Taliban\u2019s takeover, they are desperate to leave \u2014 but passage to the United States may prove elusive.More than 300,000 Afghan civilians have been affiliated with the American mission over its two-decade presence in the country, according to the International Rescue Committee, but a minority qualify for refugee protection in the United States.About 2,000 such people whose cases already had been approved have arrived in the United States on evacuation flights from Kabul, the capital, that began in July.  President Biden said on Monday while addressing the nation that there were plans to airlift more Afghan families in \u201ccoming days,\u201d though he provided no details.Refugee advocates said they feared that thousands of vulnerable people were likely to be left behind, at their peril, as militants tightened their grip on Afghanistan\u2019s territory.Since 2002, the United States has employed Afghans to assist U.S. troops, diplomats and aid workers. Many were threatened, kidnapped and attacked, and an unknown number killed, as a result of their association with the United States. In response, Congress created the special immigrant visa programs to give such workers a path to legal residency in the United States.But the programs, which enjoy broad bipartisan support, have been marred by processing delays.Applicants must show they have been employed for at least two years by the U.S. government or an associated entity. Among other paperwork, they must prove they performed valuable service by providing a recommendation from an American supervisor. They must also show that they have experienced, or are experiencing, a serious threat as a consequence of their work for the United States.More than 15,000 Afghan nationals, plus family members, have already been resettled in the United States with special immigrant visas, out of a total of 34,500 authorized visas.At least 18,000 people have applications pending, and that number is expected to increase considerably given the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan.Critics say that the U.S. government, going back several administrations, has delayed special immigrant visa approvals by demanding an extraordinary amount of documentation as part of an unwieldy 14-step process.Applicants have faced average wait times of three years, though Congress had specified that it should take no more than nine months. Many have been waiting as long as a decade for the outcome of their cases.Special immigrant visa recipients are eligible for the same resettlement benefits as refugees. They arrive with green cards, and can apply for U.S. citizenship after five years. But they are not classified as refugees, nor do they count against the number of refugees that the United States commits to admitting each year.The U.S. government since July has evacuated about 2,000 interpreters and their family members whose cases had already been approved. They were brought from Kabul to the Fort Lee military base south of Richmond, Va., and many have since been sent to cities across the country. But staff members from refugee resettlement agencies were notified after the latest flight landed on Sunday that plans to evacuate more Afghans had been suspended.Garry Reid, a civilian Pentagon official charged with handling the evacuations, said on Monday that 700 Afghan allies had been evacuated in the previous 48 hours. He said the United States would scale up by receiving more departing Afghans at U.S. military bases, but he did not offer a specific timeline.The Biden administration also had been negotiating with several countries in the Middle East and Central Asia to temporarily host some people until they can be resettled in the United States.

They must also show that they have experienced, or are experiencing, a serious threat as a consequence of their work for the United States.More than 15,000 Afghan nationals, plus family members, have already been resettled in the United States with special immigrant visas, out of a total of 34,500 authorized visas.At least 18,000 people have applications pending, and that number is expected to increase considerably given the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan.Critics say that the U.S. government, going back several administrations, has delayed special immigrant visa approvals by demanding an extraordinary amount of documentation as part of an unwieldy 14-step process.Applicants have faced average wait times of three years, though Congress had specified that it should take no more than nine months. Many have been waiting as long as a decade for the outcome of their cases.Special immigrant visa recipients are eligible for the same resettlement benefits as refugees. They arrive with green cards, and can apply for U.S. citizenship after five years. But they are not classified as refugees, nor do they count against the number of refugees that the United States commits to admitting each year.The U.S. government since July has evacuated about 2,000 interpreters and their family members whose cases had already been approved. They were brought from Kabul to the Fort Lee military base south of Richmond, Va., and many have since been sent to cities across the country. But staff members from refugee resettlement agencies were notified after the latest flight landed on Sunday that plans to evacuate more Afghans had been suspended.Garry Reid, a civilian Pentagon official charged with handling the evacuations, said on Monday that 700 Afghan allies had been evacuated in the previous 48 hours. He said the United States would scale up by receiving more departing Afghans at U.S. military bases, but he did not offer a specific timeline.The Biden administration also had been negotiating with several countries in the Middle East and Central Asia to temporarily host some people until they can be resettled in the United States. But it was not clear whether it would even be possible to evacuate more Afghan allies, at least for now, given the volatility on the ground.",
    "question": "4. Should the US government be doing more to expedite the processing of special immigrant visa applications for Afghan interpreters and their families, and if so, what steps can be taken to address the backlog?",
    "point_form_context": "1. Thousands of Afghan nationals who worked with the US military are desperate to leave Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover.\n2. More than 300,000 Afghan civilians have been affiliated with the American mission in Afghanistan over its two-decade presence.\n3. Only a minority of these people qualify for refugee protection in the United States.\n4. About 2,000 such people whose cases already had been approved have arrived in the United States on evacuation flights from Kabul.\n5. The US government has been employing Afghans to assist US troops, diplomats and aid workers since 2002."

American tourists flocked to the beaches of Spain and Greece, the countryside of Italy and the streets of Amsterdam and Paris.But on Monday, the European Union proposed new travel restrictions for unvaccinated visitors from the United States, a response to the alarming surge in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations across the Atlantic.In removing the United States from a \u201csafe list\u201d of countries whose residents can travel without requirements such as quarantine and testing, the European Council of the European Union, which represents governments of the bloc\u2019s 27 countries, signaled that potential restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus may remain in place for months. The new measures could deal a fresh blow to Europe\u2019s ailing tourism sector.Other countries removed from the \u201csafe list\u201d include Israel, Kosovo, Lebanon, Montenegro and North Macedonia, most which have reported a surge of cases in the past 14 days, according to a New York Times tracker.The suggested restrictions are not mandatory, and it remains up to each European Union member state to follow the guidelines. So it was not immediately clear which countries, if any, would reintroduce restrictions or when they might begin.If enforced, the new restrictions would apply to unvaccinated travelers only. The European Council already recommends that all visitors who have been inoculated with an E.U.-approved vaccine be allowed to travel. That includes the three vaccines available in the United States and manufactured by Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and Moderna, as well as AstraZeneca.Some countries have also implemented more stringent measures than others, even for visitors from a country on the safe list, yet once visitors have entered an E.U. country, they can move across the bloc freely.Under the current guidelines, unvaccinated travelers from countries on the European Council\u2019s safe list can visit E.U. countries without quarantining by showing a negative test. But a minority of countries have also kept self-isolation requirements in place, including, in some cases, for vaccinated visitors.Meanwhile, United States has remained closed to Europeans, who have expressed frustration at the lack of reciprocity.With more than 52 percent of Americans fully vaccinated, most were able to travel to Europe without hurdles this summer and can continue to do so. Yet the decision to remove the United States from the safe list could still create confusion among American tourists, said Marie Audren, the director of HOTREC, a lobbying group that represents the hospitality industry in Europe.\u201cEvery client at a hotel, a restaurant, a bar or a cafe was valuable to the tourism industry this summer,\u201d Ms. Audren said. \u201cAnd in recent years American tourists have become increasingly important to European countries.\u201dIn France, Greece and Spain, U.S. visitors make up the largest contingent of tourists from non-European countries, according to data provided by tourism ministries.

While figures for this summer aren\u2019t available yet, Ms. Audren said it would take years to return to prepandemic levels.Lu\u00eds Ara\u00fajo, the president of the European Travel Commission, said, \u201cFurther unjustified changes in regulations will undoubtedly negatively affect the tourism sector, which is slowly recovering from its worst crisis.\u201dIn Europe, the number of coronavirus cases has remained stable this month.

Workers at the airport, in Northern Virginia, then escorted many onto charter buses throughout the day, taking them to the nearby Dulles Expo Center, where families were being temporarily housed.Most refugees brought few belongings. Some children carried knapsacks over their shoulders. Parents held wailing babies and stacks of diapers. Others had only plastic bags stuffed with clothes.More than 6,000 Afghans have arrived in the Virginia area, Gov. Ralph Northam said on Tuesday. Many refugees are staying at the Expo Center before being shuttled to Fort Lee or Fort Pickett, where plans are made to release them in Virginia or other states.At least 1,500 American citizens and tens of thousands of Afghans who fear retribution from the Taliban remain in the country, and the Kabul airport has been a scene of chaos and violence with crowds of desperate people trying to escape as the U.S. military\u2019s Aug. 31 withdrawal deadline closes in.Those who have made it out said they were relieved to arrive in the United States, although many still feared for family members stuck in Kabul.Kamran, 23, arrived at Dulles at 4 a.m. on Wednesday with his sister and three cousins. After evacuating from Kabul and stopping in Bahrain, he said he felt good about landing in America.\u201cI feel safe here,\u201d he said before boarding one of the buses. \u201cI think it\u2019s a better place.\u201dKamran left for the Kabul airport five days ago, bringing only a small backpack with two shirts, two pairs of jeans, a pair of sneakers and his phone charger. While pushing his way through to get to the American side of the airport, Taliban members beat his head and shoulders with batons. He eventually made it through and spent two days at the airport, which he said were excruciating because the sun was \u201cburning\u201d hot and there was not enough water for everyone.Along with a group of other Afghans arriving in Virginia, Kamran took a bus to the Expo Center, where refugees were given food, drinks and a place to rest.Outside the center, refugees stepped off buses into the sweltering heat and were quickly taken inside. A row of buses lined the side of the building, which was blocked off by metal barriers and yellow police tape.Kamran said he did not yet know what he would do in America or where he would permanently live. For now, he hopes to end up in California, where one of his sisters lives.\u201cWe are just waiting and seeing what will happen,\u201d he said.Noah, a 31-year-old permanent resident who was visiting his family in Afghanistan, left the Expo Center on Wednesday afternoon with his wife, 9-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son. Heading to his home in Concord, Calif., he said he was happy to be back, although he was exhausted after passing through Qatar and Germany.On the air base in Doha, Qatar, he said, thousands of people were cramped together and there was \u201cnothing to eat.\u201d He had to leave two pieces of luggage with his clothes and documents on the plane there, and he is not sure how to retrieve them.He also expressed concern for his parents and siblings back in Kabul. His brother, who helped U.S. contractors in Afghanistan, is applying for a special immigrant visa. He is doubtful, though, that it will be granted. Although his brother went to the airport with him, Noah said he was denied a flight to America.Nadima, a 36-year-old former government employee in Afghanistan, fled Kabul the day the Taliban seized control. After her co-workers were stopped by Taliban members on their way to the office, they told her to get on a flight out of the country.Walking more than two hours to the airport, she saw cars \u201cbumper to bumper\u201d and felt a \u201csense of panic\u201d as people feared the return of the Taliban, she said.\u201cI felt heavy,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything I worked for, 20 years of work, crumbling in front of my eyes.\u201dShe eventually secured a flight to Ukraine that day and arrived at Dulles on Aug. 17. She is now staying with a friend in Arlington, Va., and she hopes to find a job soon.At the airport on Wednesday, the scene outside the processing center was tense. Anxious family members paced around, waiting for their loved ones to emerge. Many stopped airport workers to ask about flight arrival times.Joe, a 35-year-old hospitality worker who lives in Prince William County, Va., arrived at the airport at 8:30 a.m. to wait for his wife and two daughters to land. His wife left for Kabul with their children in early June to attend her brother\u2019s wedding, which was supposed to take place on Aug. 15, the day the Taliban took control of the capital.\u201cI\u2019m feeling a little more relieved knowing they\u2019re on a flight home, but I would be a lot happier if I saw them already,\u201d he said.",

    "context": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Biden administration, under pressure from families of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks, said on Monday that it intended to disclose some long-classified documents that the families think could detail connections between the government of Saudi Arabia and the hijackers who carried out the attacks.In a court filing in long-running litigation brought by the victims\u2019 families against Saudi Arabia, the Justice Department said that the F.B.I. \u201crecently\u201d closed a portion of its investigation into the terrorist attacks and was beginning a review of documents that it had previously said must remain secret with an eye toward disclosing more of them.\u201cThe F.B.I. has decided to review its prior privilege assertions to identify additional information appropriate for disclosure,\u201d the department said in a letter to two federal judges in Manhattan overseeing the case. \u201cThe F.B.I. will disclose such information on a rolling basis as expeditiously as possible.\u201dThe terse letter provided no further details about what additional information might become public, or when disclosures would begin.The decision came after a group representing more than 1,600 people directly affected by the attacks called last week for President Biden to not participate in any memorial events for the 20th anniversary of the attacks next month unless he fulfilled a campaign promise to review the documents for possible declassification and release.After the filing, the White House issued a statement from Mr. Biden expressing sympathy for the family members and invoking a 2009 policy, issued when he was vice president, that imposed limits on when the government may assert the state secrets privilege to block the disclosure of evidence in lawsuits for national security reasons.\u201cAs I promised during my campaign, my administration is committed to ensuring the maximum degree of transparency under the law, and to adhering to the rigorous guidance issued during the Obama-Biden administration on the invocation of the state secrets privilege,\u201d Mr. Biden said.He added, \u201cIn this vein, I welcome the Department of Justice\u2019s filing today, which commits to conducting a fresh review of documents where the government has previously asserted privileges, and to doing so as quickly as possible.\u201dIn a letter sent to a representative of the families before the presidential election last fall, Mr. Biden had said he would direct his attorney general to \u201cexamine the merits of all cases where the invocation of privilege is recommended, and to err on the side of disclosure in cases where, as here, the events in question occurred two decades or longer ago.\u201dMr. Biden had referred to a Trump-era decision that kept the documents classified on the grounds that they contained state secrets, and said his own administration would \u201cwork constructively on such cases.\u201dNearly 3,000 people died in the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. The organizers of the statement last week calling for Mr. Biden to release the documents said they were unsure how many victims were represented by its more than 1,600 signatures. Each name belongs to either a close relative of someone whose death was caused by the attacks, a person who became severely sick as a result of them or a survivor, they said.The Biden administration\u2019s decision to review the classified documents was the latest development in a nearly two-decade odyssey for some of the families. They have pushed four American presidents, with little success, to release more information about Saudi involvement in financing the attacks.The 9/11 Commission found \u201cno evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded\u201d Al Qaeda, which carried out the attacks. But the commission\u2019s phrasing left some to speculate that there might be evidence of involvement by other, lower-ranking officials.An investigation last year by The New York Times Magazine and ProPublica found that F.B.I. agents, who secretly investigated Saudi connections to the Sept. 11 attacks for more than a decade, had discovered circumstantial evidence of such support but no smoking gun.The families were stunned in 2019 when William P. Barr, who was the attorney general under President Donald J. Trump at the time, declared in a statement to a federal court that documents relating to the attacks should stay classified to protect national security.On Friday, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said that White House officials had met in recent weeks with groups representing families of victims, and that the document requests would \u201ccontinue to be a priority\u201d for Mr. Biden.In the statement last week, the families group said that it could not \u201cin good faith, and with veneration to those lost, sick and injured,\u201d welcome Mr. Biden to the commemorations next month if he did not follow through on his campaign promise.\u201cIt\u2019s 20 years; this has gone on for too long,\u201d Brett Eagleson, who was a 15-year-old sophomore in high school when his father, Bruce, died at the World Trade Center, said in an interview last week. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to release the documents and you\u2019re going to continue with the process of covering up the Saudi role in 9/11, we\u2019ll have to object to you coming.\u201dMr. Eagleson, who is now 35 and works in banking, said that seeing the documents might offer him and other victims\u2019 relatives some long-overdue closure.He said on Monday that the F.B.I.\u2019s review was a step in the right direction, but that it was not sufficient to assuage families\u2019 anxieties about the documents.\u201cIt sounds like it\u2019s promising, but let\u2019s see what they actually produce,\u201d he said.Another group of victims\u2019 families and survivors, 9/11 Community United, criticized the Biden administration\u2019s move, calling it a \u201chalfhearted, insufficient commitment to transparency\u201d in a statement and saying that it applied only to limited documents.\u201cThis announcement is a necessary but insufficient step towards transparency, accountability and above all, justice,\u201d a member of the group, Terry Strada, whose husband died in the attacks, said in a statement.Mr. Eagleson is among the thousands of victims\u2019 relatives who accused Saudi Arabia in a 2017 lawsuit of complicity in the attacks. They had successfully fought for years for the right to sue, gaining it in 2016 when Congress overrode a veto by President Barack Obama to pass into law a bill allowing such a lawsuit.The suit has languished in the courts as lawyers for the kingdom fought it.

    "context": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Biden administration, under pressure from families of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks, said on Monday that it intended to disclose some long-classified documents that the families think could detail connections between the government of Saudi Arabia and the hijackers who carried out the attacks.In a court filing in long-running litigation brought by the victims\u2019 families against Saudi Arabia, the Justice Department said that the F.B.I. \u201crecently\u201d closed a portion of its investigation into the terrorist attacks and was beginning a review of documents that it had previously said must remain secret with an eye toward disclosing more of them.\u201cThe F.B.I. has decided to review its prior privilege assertions to identify additional information appropriate for disclosure,\u201d the department said in a letter to two federal judges in Manhattan overseeing the case. \u201cThe F.B.I. will disclose such information on a rolling basis as expeditiously as possible.\u201dThe terse letter provided no further details about what additional information might become public, or when disclosures would begin.The decision came after a group representing more than 1,600 people directly affected by the attacks called last week for President Biden to not participate in any memorial events for the 20th anniversary of the attacks next month unless he fulfilled a campaign promise to review the documents for possible declassification and release.After the filing, the White House issued a statement from Mr. Biden expressing sympathy for the family members and invoking a 2009 policy, issued when he was vice president, that imposed limits on when the government may assert the state secrets privilege to block the disclosure of evidence in lawsuits for national security reasons.\u201cAs I promised during my campaign, my administration is committed to ensuring the maximum degree of transparency under the law, and to adhering to the rigorous guidance issued during the Obama-Biden administration on the invocation of the state secrets privilege,\u201d Mr. Biden said.He added, \u201cIn this vein, I welcome the Department of Justice\u2019s filing today, which commits to conducting a fresh review of documents where the government has previously asserted privileges, and to doing so as quickly as possible.\u201dIn a letter sent to a representative of the families before the presidential election last fall, Mr. Biden had said he would direct his attorney general to \u201cexamine the merits of all cases where the invocation of privilege is recommended, and to err on the side of disclosure in cases where, as here, the events in question occurred two decades or longer ago.\u201dMr. Biden had referred to a Trump-era decision that kept the documents classified on the grounds that they contained state secrets, and said his own administration would \u201cwork constructively on such cases.\u201dNearly 3,000 people died in the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. The organizers of the statement last week calling for Mr. Biden to release the documents said they were unsure how many victims were represented by its more than 1,600 signatures.

They have pushed four American presidents, with little success, to release more information about Saudi involvement in financing the attacks.The 9/11 Commission found \u201cno evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded\u201d Al Qaeda, which carried out the attacks. But the commission\u2019s phrasing left some to speculate that there might be evidence of involvement by other, lower-ranking officials.An investigation last year by The New York Times Magazine and ProPublica found that F.B.I. agents, who secretly investigated Saudi connections to the Sept. 11 attacks for more than a decade, had discovered circumstantial evidence of such support but no smoking gun.The families were stunned in 2019 when William P. Barr, who was the attorney general under President Donald J. Trump at the time, declared in a statement to a federal court that documents relating to the attacks should stay classified to protect national security.On Friday, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said that White House officials had met in recent weeks with groups representing families of victims, and that the document requests would \u201ccontinue to be a priority\u201d for Mr. Biden.In the statement last week, the families group said that it could not \u201cin good faith, and with veneration to those lost, sick and injured,\u201d welcome Mr. Biden to the commemorations next month if he did not follow through on his campaign promise.\u201cIt\u2019s 20 years; this has gone on for too long,\u201d Brett Eagleson, who was a 15-year-old sophomore in high school when his father, Bruce, died at the World Trade Center, said in an interview last week. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to release the documents and you\u2019re going to continue with the process of covering up the Saudi role in 9/11, we\u2019ll have to object to you coming.\u201dMr. Eagleson, who is now 35 and works in banking, said that seeing the documents might offer him and other victims\u2019 relatives some long-overdue closure.He said on Monday that the F.B.I.\u2019s review was a step in the right direction, but that it was not sufficient to assuage families\u2019 anxieties about the documents.\u201cIt sounds like it\u2019s promising, but let\u2019s see what they actually produce,\u201d he said.Another group of victims\u2019 families and survivors, 9/11 Community United, criticized the Biden administration\u2019s move, calling it a \u201chalfhearted, insufficient commitment to transparency\u201d in a statement and saying that it applied only to limited documents.\u201cThis announcement is a necessary but insufficient step towards transparency, accountability and above all, justice,\u201d a member of the group, Terry Strada, whose husband died in the attacks, said in a statement.Mr. Eagleson is among the thousands of victims\u2019 relatives who accused Saudi Arabia in a 2017 lawsuit of complicity in the attacks.

    "context": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Biden nominated Damian Williams as the U.S. attorney in Manhattan on Tuesday, naming the first African American to lead one of the most powerful prosecutor\u2019s offices in the country as part of a slate of picks for top law enforcement posts.Mr. Williams would lead the Southern District of New York after working as a prosecutor in the office for nearly a decade, most recently overseeing a unit that specializes in securities fraud. The office has handled some of the nation\u2019s most politically sensitive cases, including several inquiries of people close to former President Donald J. Trump.Mr. Biden also announced nominees to supervise two other offices that tend to investigate the Justice Department\u2019s more prominent cases, including Breon S. Peace, a former federal prosecutor, as the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn and Jessica D. Aber as the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, where she has worked since 2009. All three nominations would have to be confirmed by the Senate.The timing of the appointments is crucial to Mr. Biden\u2019s bid to curb gun violence and prosecute gun trafficking, the White House said in a statement announcing the nominations. The president pledged this summer to make federal tools available to the state and local authorities to combat an uptick of violent crime in big cities.\u201cThese individuals were chosen for their devotion to enforcing the law, their professionalism, their experience and credentials in this field, their dedication to pursuing equal justice for all, and their commitment to the independence of the Department of Justice,\u201d the White House said.Mr. Biden also tapped Carla B. Freedman, a prosecutor in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Northern District of New York, to lead the office, setting her up to be the first Senate-confirmed woman to fill the position. The other nominations include William J. Ihlenfeld II as the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of West Virginia, Christopher R. Kavanaugh as the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Virginia, Darcie N. McElwee as the U.S. attorney for the District of Maine, and William S. Thompson as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia.Many of the nominations were expected after senior lawmakers this year advised Mr. Biden on their picks for judges and U.S. attorneys. Presidents typically defer to such recommendations when selecting top prosecutors.In March, Senator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, asked Mr. Biden to nominate both Mr. Williams and Mr. Peace, who is also Black, after a year in which mass protests across the country cast attention on racist policing tactics.Mr. Williams, a graduate of Harvard University and Yale Law School, would take over an office that had a tumultuous four years under the Trump administration, including two U.S. attorneys, Preet Bharara and Geoffrey S. Berman, who were ousted.Among the associates of Mr. Trump prosecuted by the Southern District of New York were Stephen K. Bannon, a former chief strategist for Mr. Trump, and Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump\u2019s onetime fixer. In 2018, the office obtained a guilty plea from Mr. Cohen on campaign finance violations, including a charge that stemmed from a $130,000 hush-money payment to the pornographic film star Stormy Daniels.The office is currently investigating whether Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyers and a former U.S. attorney in Manhattan, broke lobbying laws in his dealings with Ukraine. Mr. Giuliani has denied wrongdoing.Mr. Williams, who clerked for Mr. Biden\u2019s attorney general, Merrick B. Garland, is likely to oversee major trials of Ghislaine Maxwell, the longtime companion of Jeffrey Epstein, who was accused of helping him recruit and sexually abuse minors; and Sayfullo Saipov, the Uzbek man charged in a 2017 truck attack that killed eight people on a Manhattan bike path. The government has said it will seek the death penalty if he is convicted. Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Saipov have both pleaded not guilty.Mr. Williams has experience investigating politically sensitive cases. In 2018, he helped secure a conviction on corruption charges of Sheldon Silver, the former Democratic speaker of the New York State Assembly, after an earlier conviction was overturned on appeal. Mr. Silver is serving a seven-year sentence.If confirmed, Mr. Peace would oversee an office that in 2019 secured the conviction of Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera, the Mexican drug lord known as El Chapo.In Virginia, Senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, both Democrats, recommended Ms. Aber oversee the Eastern District office. The office has prosecuted high-profile cases of leaks of government data, including that of Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, and Chelsea Manning, the former Army intelligence analyst convicted in 2013 of leaking archives of secret military and diplomatic documents to WikiLeaks.Mr. Kavanaugh, Mr. Biden\u2019s pick to lead the Western District of Virginia, has a background in domestic extremism, which Mr. Biden has described as a priority to combat. Mr. Kavanaugh helped lead the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into the 2017 white supremacist riots in Charlottesville, Va., as well as securing hate crime charges against a man convicted of killing a woman and injuring dozens when he rammed his car into a group of people protesting one of the rallies.",

All three nominations would have to be confirmed by the Senate.The timing of the appointments is crucial to Mr. Biden\u2019s bid to curb gun violence and prosecute gun trafficking, the White House said in a statement announcing the nominations. The president pledged this summer to make federal tools available to the state and local authorities to combat an uptick of violent crime in big cities.\u201cThese individuals were chosen for their devotion to enforcing the law, their professionalism, their experience and credentials in this field, their dedication to pursuing equal justice for all, and their commitment to the independence of the Department of Justice,\u201d the White House said.Mr. Biden also tapped Carla B.

Thompson as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia.Many of the nominations were expected after senior lawmakers this year advised Mr. Biden on their picks for judges and U.S. attorneys. Presidents typically defer to such recommendations when selecting top prosecutors.In March, Senator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, asked Mr. Biden to nominate both Mr. Williams and Mr. Peace, who is also Black, after a year in which mass protests across the country cast attention on racist policing tactics.Mr. Williams, a graduate of Harvard University and Yale Law School, would take over an office that had a tumultuous four years under the Trump administration, including two U.S. attorneys, Preet Bharara and Geoffrey S. Berman, who were ousted.Among the associates of Mr. Trump prosecuted by the Southern District of New York were Stephen K. Bannon, a former chief strategist for Mr. Trump, and Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump\u2019s onetime fixer. In 2018, the office obtained a guilty plea from Mr. Cohen on campaign finance violations, including a charge that stemmed from a $130,000 hush-money payment to the pornographic film star Stormy Daniels.The office is currently investigating whether Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyers and a former U.S. attorney in Manhattan, broke lobbying laws in his dealings with Ukraine. Mr. Giuliani has denied wrongdoing.Mr. Williams, who clerked for Mr. Biden\u2019s attorney general, Merrick B. Garland, is likely to oversee major trials of Ghislaine Maxwell, the longtime companion of Jeffrey Epstein, who was accused of helping him recruit and sexually abuse minors; and Sayfullo Saipov, the Uzbek man charged in a 2017 truck attack that killed eight people on a Manhattan bike path. The government has said it will seek the death penalty if he is convicted. Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Saipov have both pleaded not guilty.Mr. Williams has experience investigating politically sensitive cases. In 2018, he helped secure a conviction on corruption charges of Sheldon Silver, the former Democratic speaker of the New York State Assembly, after an earlier conviction was overturned on appeal. Mr. Silver is serving a seven-year sentence.If confirmed, Mr. Peace would oversee an office that in 2019 secured the conviction of Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera, the Mexican drug lord known as El Chapo.In Virginia, Senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, both Democrats, recommended Ms. Aber oversee the Eastern District office. The office has prosecuted high-profile cases of leaks of government data, including that of Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, and Chelsea Manning, the former Army intelligence analyst convicted in 2013 of leaking archives of secret military and diplomatic documents to WikiLeaks.Mr. Kavanaugh, Mr. Biden\u2019s pick to lead the Western District of Virginia, has a background in domestic extremism, which Mr. Biden has described as a priority to combat. Mr. Kavanaugh helped lead the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into the 2017 white supremacist riots in Charlottesville, Va., as well as securing hate crime charges against a man convicted of killing a woman and injuring dozens when he rammed his car into a group of people protesting one of the rallies.",

    "context": "GUANT\u00c1NAMO BAY, Cuba \u2014 Translation and interpretation problems on Monday delayed by one day military efforts to formally charge three Southeast Asian men \u2014 held by the United States for 18 years \u2014 with conspiring in deadly terrorist bombings in Indonesia in 2002 and 2003.Prosecutors accuse the three prisoners \u2014 Encep Nurjaman, who is known as Hambali; Mohammed Nazir Bin Lep; and Mohammed Farik Bin Amin \u2014 of murder, terrorism and conspiracy in the 2002 nightclub bombings in Bali, which killed 202 people, and the 2003 Marriott hotel bombing in Jakarta, which killed at least 11 people and wounded at least 80.Defense lawyers have called them torture victims who spent about three years in the secret C.I.A. prison network where agents used waterboarding, sleep deprivation, beatings, painful shackling and other now outlawed \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d techniques to extract information from their captives.In 2003, a C.I.A. interrogator told Mr. Hambali that he would never go to court, because \u201cwe can never let the world know what I have done to you,\u201d according to a study of the C.I.A. program that was released by the Senate Intelligence Committee in December 2014.Monday\u2019s formal charging was meant to be a crossroads of sorts, the start of proceedings in a case that was approved by a Trump administration appointee on Jan. 21, the first full day of President Biden\u2019s administration \u2014 and postponed by six months by pandemic restrictions.The proceedings ended up being the latest example of the delays that have plagued Guant\u00e1namo\u2019s justice system nearly 20 years after it was chosen to hold detainees captured after the Sept. 11 attacks and in the global effort to track down terrorists.All three men have been in the custody of the United States since 2003, and have been held at Guant\u00e1namo as members of Jemaah Islamiyah, a Southeast Asian extremist group. Mr. Hambali, who is Indonesian, is accused of allying himself with Osama bin Laden\u2019s global jihad, and sending Mr. Bin Amin and Mr. Bin Lep, former architecture students who met in college in Malaysia, to train in Qaeda camps in Afghanistan.Translation and technical issues were evident at the outset. One lawyer pointed out that a prisoner had mentioned \u201cGoogle\u201d in a remark in Malay for the judge, but the court interpreter did not mention the search engine in an English translation. The Indonesian translator turned \u201clegal training\u201d in English into \u201ctraining legal\u201d in Bahasa Indonesian.Defense lawyers said with alarm that all three defendants recognized a \u201cMr. Singh,\u201d a translator with whom they each had confidential conversations as they prepared to seek release through a review board hearing, sitting beside the lead prosecutor in court on Monday, now working for the prosecution.Lawyers for the three prisoners also told the judge that the court\u2019s official Indonesian translator had in 2020 offered the opinion that \u201cthe government is wasting money on these terrorists; they should have been killed a long time ago,\u201d and added that they had a sworn affidavit from a witness who heard the remark. Prosecutors are seeking life sentences in the case.Mr. Bin Lep\u2019s lawyer, Brian Bouffard, declared the Indonesian American contract translator \u201cirretrievably biased.\u201d Mr. Bin Amin\u2019s lawyer, Christine Funk, questioned why the prosecutors needed an interpreter at the arraignment hearing in the first place: \u201cAre they spying on us? I don\u2019t know.\u201dThe trial judge, Navy Cmdr. Hayes C. Larsen, tried to mend the problems. He gave the official court translation team 10-minute breaks every 20 minutes. He told defense lawyers to file legal motions if they believed there were interpretation problems that required remedies. And he postponed until Tuesday the reading of the charges, which was the reason for Monday\u2019s hearing.Defense lawyers, both civilian and military, and all paid by the Pentagon, described the case as still in its infancy. Prosecutors, they said, had provided perhaps 2 percent of the pretrial documents that could be used in the case, including accounts of interrogations the F.B.I. did in 2007 with the prisoners soon after their transfer to military custody from the C.I.A. Prosecutors declined to comment.Mr. Hambali\u2019s lawyer, James R. Hodes, called the case \u201cabsurd,\u201d in part because of the length of his client\u2019s detention and the nearly two-decade delay in bringing charges against him. He told reporters before the hearing that Mr. Hambali had been \u201cbrutalized\u201d and spent at least half of his detention in solitary confinement. He said the prisoner was owed \u201can apology\u201d and repatriation, \u201cnot to be held in a cage in a Caribbean island.\u201dHearings at Guant\u00e1namo have been mostly held between English and Arabic, but have also suffered translation problems. In 2015, one of the men accused of plotting the Sept. 11 attacks blurted out the name of a translator in court \u2014 and disclosed that the linguist had previously worked for the C.I.A. at a black site, exposing his identity and derailing a week of hearings.Finding U.S. translators with top-secret security clearances who speak Southeast Asian languages has apparently proved even more of a challenge. The Senate study of the C.I.A.\u2019s interrogation program cited a January 2004 cable from a secret detention site that reported that Mr. Bin Lep\u2019s \u201cEnglish is very poor, and we do not have a Malay linguist.\u201d",

    "context": "GUANT\u00c1NAMO BAY, Cuba \u2014 Translation and interpretation problems on Monday delayed by one day military efforts to formally charge three Southeast Asian men \u2014 held by the United States for 18 years \u2014 with conspiring in deadly terrorist bombings in Indonesia in 2002 and 2003.Prosecutors accuse the three prisoners \u2014 Encep Nurjaman, who is known as Hambali; Mohammed Nazir Bin Lep; and Mohammed Farik Bin Amin \u2014 of murder, terrorism and conspiracy in the 2002 nightclub bombings in Bali, which killed 202 people, and the 2003 Marriott hotel bombing in Jakarta, which killed at least 11 people and wounded at least 80.Defense lawyers have called them torture victims who spent about three years in the secret C.I.A. prison network where agents used waterboarding, sleep deprivation, beatings, painful shackling and other now outlawed \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d techniques to extract information from their captives.In 2003, a C.I.A. interrogator told Mr. Hambali that he would never go to court, because \u201cwe can never let the world know what I have done to you,\u201d according to a study of the C.I.A. program that was released by the Senate Intelligence Committee in December 2014.Monday\u2019s formal charging was meant to be a crossroads of sorts, the start of proceedings in a case that was approved by a Trump administration appointee on Jan. 21, the first full day of President Biden\u2019s administration \u2014 and postponed by six months by pandemic restrictions.The proceedings ended up being the latest example of the delays that have plagued Guant\u00e1namo\u2019s justice system nearly 20 years after it was chosen to hold detainees captured after the Sept. 11 attacks and in the global effort to track down terrorists.All three men have been in the custody of the United States since 2003, and have been held at Guant\u00e1namo as members of Jemaah Islamiyah, a Southeast Asian extremist group. Mr. Hambali, who is Indonesian, is accused of allying himself with Osama bin Laden\u2019s global jihad, and sending Mr. Bin Amin and Mr. Bin Lep, former architecture students who met in college in Malaysia, to train in Qaeda camps in Afghanistan.Translation and technical issues were evident at the outset. One lawyer pointed out that a prisoner had mentioned \u201cGoogle\u201d in a remark in Malay for the judge, but the court interpreter did not mention the search engine in an English translation. The Indonesian translator turned \u201clegal training\u201d in English into \u201ctraining legal\u201d in Bahasa Indonesian.Defense lawyers said with alarm that all three defendants recognized a \u201cMr. Singh,\u201d a translator with whom they each had confidential conversations as they prepared to seek release through a review board hearing, sitting beside the lead prosecutor in court on Monday, now working for the prosecution.Lawyers for the three prisoners also told the judge that the court\u2019s official Indonesian translator had in 2020 offered the opinion that \u201cthe government is wasting money on these terrorists; they should have been killed a long time ago,\u201d and added that they had a sworn affidavit from a witness who heard the remark. Prosecutors are seeking life sentences in the case.Mr. Bin Lep\u2019s lawyer, Brian Bouffard, declared the Indonesian American contract translator \u201cirretrievably biased.\u201d Mr. Bin Amin\u2019s lawyer, Christine Funk, questioned why the prosecutors needed an interpreter at the arraignment hearing in the first place: \u201cAre they spying on us? I don\u2019t know.\u201dThe trial judge, Navy Cmdr. Hayes C. Larsen, tried to mend the problems. He gave the official court translation team 10-minute breaks every 20 minutes. He told defense lawyers to file legal motions if they believed there were interpretation problems that required remedies. And he postponed until Tuesday the reading of the charges, which was the reason for Monday\u2019s hearing.Defense lawyers, both civilian and military, and all paid by the Pentagon, described the case as still in its infancy. Prosecutors, they said, had provided perhaps 2 percent of the pretrial documents that could be used in the case, including accounts of interrogations the F.B.I. did in 2007 with the prisoners soon after their transfer to military custody from the C.I.A. Prosecutors declined to comment.Mr. Hambali\u2019s lawyer, James R. Hodes, called the case \u201cabsurd,\u201d in part because of the length of his client\u2019s detention and the nearly two-decade delay in bringing charges against him. He told reporters before the hearing that Mr. Hambali had been \u201cbrutalized\u201d and spent at least half of his detention in solitary confinement. He said the prisoner was owed \u201can apology\u201d and repatriation, \u201cnot to be held in a cage in a Caribbean island.\u201dHearings at Guant\u00e1namo have been mostly held between English and Arabic, but have also suffered translation problems.
