      "If you had told me several months ago, immediately after Elon Musk bought Twitter and Ron DeSantis celebrated a thumping re-election victory, that DeSantis would launch his presidential campaign in conversation with Musk, I would have thought, intriguing: The rightward-trending billionaire whose rockets and cars stand out in an economy dominated by apps and financial instruments meets the Republican politician whose real-world victories contrast with the virtual populism of Donald Trump.",
      "The actual launch of DeSantis\u2019s presidential campaign, in a \u201cTwitter Spaces\u201d event that crashed repeatedly and played to a smaller audience than he would have claimed just by showing up on Fox, instead offered the political version of the lesson that we\u2019ve been taught repeatedly by Musk\u2019s stewardship of Twitter: The internet can be a trap.",
      "For the Tesla and SpaceX mogul, the trap was sprung because Musk wanted to attack the groupthink of liberal institutions, and seeing that groupthink manifest on his favorite social media site, he imagined that owning Twitter was the key to transforming public discourse.",
      "But for all its influence, social media is still downstream of other institutions \u2014 universities, newspapers, television channels, movie studios, other internet platforms. Twitter is real life, but only through its relationship to other realities; it doesn\u2019t have the capacity to be a hub of discourse, news gathering or entertainment on its own. And many of Musk\u2019s difficulties as the Twitter C.E.O. have reflected a simple overestimation of social media\u2019s inherent authority and influence.",
      "Thus he\u2019s tried to sell the privilege of verification, the famous \u201cblue checks,\u201d without recognizing that they were valued because of their connection to real-world institutions and lose value if they reflect a Twitter hierarchy alone. Or he\u2019s encouraged his favored journalists to publish their scoops and essays on his site when it isn\u2019t yet built out for that kind of publication. Or he\u2019s encouraged media figures like Tucker Carlson and now politicians like DeSantis to run shows or do interviews on his platform, without having the infrastructure in place to make all that work.",
      "It\u2019s entirely possible that Musk can build out that infrastructure eventually, and make Twitter more capacious than it is today. But there isn\u2019t some immediate social-media shortcut to the influence he\u2019s seeking. If you want Twitter to be the world\u2019s news hub, you probably need a Twitter newsroom. If you want Twitter to host presidential candidates, you probably need a Twitter channel that feels like a professional newscast. And while you\u2019re trying to build those things, you need to be careful that the nature of social media doesn\u2019t diminish you to the kind of caricatured role \u2014 troll instead of tycoon \u2014 that tempts everyone on Twitter.",
      "That kind of diminishment is what the Twitter event handed to DeSantis, whose choppy launch may be forgotten but who would be wise to learn from what went wrong. There\u2019s an emerging criticism of the Florida governor that suggests that his whole persona is too online \u2014 that his talk about wokeness, wokeness, wokeness is pitched to a narrow and internet-based faction within the G.O.P., that he\u2019s setting himself to be like Elizabeth Warren in 2020, whose promise of plans, plans, plans thrilled the wonk faction but fell flat with normal Democratic voters.",
      "I think this critique is overdrawn. If you look at polling of Republican primary voters, the culture war appears to be a general concern rather than an elite fixation, and there\u2019s a plausible argument that the conflict with the new progressivism is the main thing binding the G.O.P. coalition together.",
      "But it does seem true that the conflict with progressivism in the context of social media is a more boutique taste, and that lots of anti-woke conservatives aren\u2019t particularly invested in whether the previous Twitter regime was throttling such-and-such right-wing influencer or taking orders from such-and-such \u201cdisinformation\u201d specialist. And it\u2019s also true that DeSantis is running against a candidate who, at any moment, can return to Twitter and bestride its feeds like a colossus, no matter whatever Republican alternative the \u201cchief twit\u201d might prefer.",
      "So introducing himself in that online space made DeSantis look unnecessarily small \u2014 smaller than Musk\u2019s presence and Trump\u2019s absence, shrunk down to the scale of debates about shadow banning and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The Florida governor\u2019s best self-advertisement in a primary should be his promise to be more active in reality than Trump, with his claim to be better at actual governance made manifest through his advantage in flesh-pressing, campaign-trail-hitting energy.",
      "The good news for DeSantis is that he doesn\u2019t have billions invested in a social media company, so having endured a diminishing introduction, he can slip the trap and walk away \u2014 toward the crowds, klieg lights and the grass.",
      "For Musk, though, escape requires either the admission of defeat in this particular arena or else a long campaign of innovation that eventually makes Twitter as big as he wrongly imagined it to be."

And many of Musk\u2019s difficulties as the Twitter C.E.O. have reflected a simple overestimation of social media\u2019s inherent authority and influence.",
      "Thus he\u2019s tried to sell the privilege of verification, the famous \u201cblue checks,\u201d without recognizing that they were valued because of their connection to real-world institutions and lose value if they reflect a Twitter hierarchy alone. Or he\u2019s encouraged his favored journalists to publish their scoops and essays on his site when it isn\u2019t yet built out for that kind of publication. Or he\u2019s encouraged media figures like Tucker Carlson and now politicians like DeSantis to run shows or do interviews on his platform, without having the infrastructure in place to make all that work.",
      "It\u2019s entirely possible that Musk can build out that infrastructure eventually, and make Twitter more capacious than it is today. But there isn\u2019t some immediate social-media shortcut to the influence he\u2019s seeking. If you want Twitter to be the world\u2019s news hub, you probably need a Twitter newsroom. If you want Twitter to host presidential candidates, you probably need a Twitter channel that feels like a professional newscast. And while you\u2019re trying to build those things, you need to be careful that the nature of social media doesn\u2019t diminish you to the kind of caricatured role \u2014 troll instead of tycoon \u2014 that tempts everyone on Twitter.",
      "That kind of diminishment is what the Twitter event handed to DeSantis, whose choppy launch may be forgotten but who would be wise to learn from what went wrong. There\u2019s an emerging criticism of the Florida governor that suggests that his whole persona is too online \u2014 that his talk about wokeness, wokeness, wokeness is pitched to a narrow and internet-based faction within the G.O.P., that he\u2019s setting himself to be like Elizabeth Warren in 2020, whose promise of plans, plans, plans thrilled the wonk faction but fell flat with normal Democratic voters.",
      "I think this critique is overdrawn. If you look at polling of Republican primary voters, the culture war appears to be a general concern rather than an elite fixation, and there\u2019s a plausible argument that the conflict with the new progressivism is the main thing binding the G.O.P. coalition together.",
      "But it does seem true that the conflict with progressivism in the context of social media is a more boutique taste, and that lots of anti-woke conservatives aren\u2019t particularly invested in whether the previous Twitter regime was throttling such-and-such right-wing influencer or taking orders from such-and-such \u201cdisinformation\u201d specialist. And it\u2019s also true that DeSantis is running against a candidate who, at any moment, can return to Twitter and bestride its feeds like a colossus, no matter whatever Republican alternative the \u201cchief twit\u201d might prefer.",
      "So introducing himself in that online space made DeSantis look unnecessarily small \u2014 smaller than Musk\u2019s presence and Trump\u2019s absence, shrunk down to the scale of debates about shadow banning and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The Florida governor\u2019s best self-advertisement in a primary should be his promise to be more active in reality than Trump, with his claim to be better at actual governance made manifest through his advantage in flesh-pressing, campaign-trail-hitting energy.",
      "The good news for DeSantis is that he doesn\u2019t have billions invested in a social media company, so having endured a diminishing introduction, he can slip the trap and walk away \u2014 toward the crowds, klieg lights and the grass.",
      "For Musk, though, escape requires either the admission of defeat in this particular arena or else a long campaign of innovation that eventually makes Twitter as big as he wrongly imagined it to be."

      "The recent Federal Reserve's Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking highlights a job market that is doing relatively well, but Americans' perception of the national economy is quite bleak. This gap is likely due in part to negative media coverage, pessimistic economic outlooks from experts, and political polarization. While unemployment rates are currently at historic lows, many Americans are facing financial challenges due to inflation and healthcare costs. For instance, 66% of Americans are reducing their savings and 51% are using less of a product due to higher prices. Additionally, 42% of uninsured individuals are going without medical treatment because they cannot afford it, compared to 26% of insured individuals.",
      "One of the significant challenges that low-income Americans face when it comes to emergency expenses is the inability to afford necessary medical treatment or other unexpected expenses. This can have a severe impact on their financial stability and lead to long-term health problems. A recent survey found that 63% of people would pay for a $400 emergency expense using their savings, credit card or cash, while 37% would have to borrow, sell something, or not pay the expense. This further underscores the financial insecurity that many Americans are facing.",
      "Moreover, low-income Americans' limited access to affordable health insurance and healthcare services can exacerbate their financial challenges. For example, without proper coverage, they may struggle to pay for the cost of prescription drugs and medical treatments, which can quickly escalate and place a significant strain on their finances. This not only threatens their financial stability but also impacts their overall health and well-being.",
      "In conclusion, low-income Americans face significant challenges when it comes to emergency expenses, which can have long-lasting effects on their financial stability. The issues surrounding unaffordable healthcare and limited access to insurance are particularly concerning and require urgent attention."

Individuals who graduate with significant amounts of student debt or struggle to find well-paying jobs may be more likely to regret their choice. On the other hand, those who are able to secure stable job prospects that allow them to pay off their debt and achieve financial stability are less likely to regret their choice."

      "In an interview last month, Justice Samuel Alito complained about excessive criticism of the Supreme Court. To him, this criticism has not identified discrete problems to be solved but rather represent bad-faith efforts by critics to do nothing more than give the public a \u201creason to question our legitimacy.\u201d",
      "The not-so-subtle implication of what has become a regular talking point for conservatives is that the court isn\u2019t \u2014 and shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 responsive to public criticism. And if that\u2019s true, it must follow that public criticism doesn\u2019t serve a legitimate purpose, especially if it is unlikely to spur meaningful reform from Congress.",
      "Yet this attempt to delegitimize public criticism fails at its inception. Even if reform from Congress is not imminent, we ought not drop the focus on another potential vehicle for reforms: the court itself.",
      "There are both historical and recent examples of how the court, in response to mounting public pressure and criticism, has changed its ways, examples that underscore the value and opportunities provided by continued public pushback today.",
      "Perhaps the most famous example of the court\u2019s responding to public criticism came in 1937. After the 1936 election, in which President Franklin Roosevelt ran as much against the court \u2014 which was blocking economic measures meant to respond to the dire conditions of the Depression \u2014 as against Gov. Alf Landon of Kansas, Justice Owen Roberts made the switch in time that saved nine, a shift that historians debate was due to Roosevelt\u2019s proposal to add six seats to the court or, more generally, in response to the broader atmospherics of the president\u2019s re-election. Either way, the court\u2019s shift was precipitated by substantial public backlash against its recent behavior, and it opened the door to an era of greater judicial deference to economic regulation and greater judicial protection of civil rights.",
      "To similar effect (albeit in a different direction), the Supreme Court of the mid-1970s responded to public criticism on the issue of the death penalty. When the justices effectively imposed a nationwide moratorium on capital punishment in 1972, the political backlash was extraordinary \u2014 at both the state and the federal level. In exchange for adopting a series of procedures designed to make imposition of the death penalty less arbitrary (at least in appearance), dozens of states and Congress aggressively pushed the court to reauthorize capital punishment. On July 2, 1976, the court acquiesced.",
      "In the past 18 months, we\u2019ve seen a similar \u2014 if subtler \u2014 shift in the court\u2019s behavior that again closely correlates with public criticism and pushback. In this case, it has been related to how the justices issue unsigned and (usually) unexplained orders concerning applications for emergency relief, on what Will Baude, a University of Chicago law professor, first called \u201cthe shadow docket.\u201d",
      "Starting in 2017, there was a great shift in how the conservative majority used unsigned, unexplained orders, especially in the context of applications for emergency relief (to freeze or unfreeze lower-court rulings while a case works its way through the courts). Far more than ever before, the justices started using these orders in ways that had nationwide implications \u2014 allowing, for example, President Donald Trump to carry out a series of immigration policies that lower courts had struck down (and no court would ever uphold) and blocking a series of Covid mitigation measures in blue states on novel religious liberty grounds.",
      "By contrast, the court showed nowhere near the same appetite to intervene to protect President Biden\u2019s policies or to block controversial laws in red states \u2014 like Texas\u2019 six-week abortion ban, which the court, in September 2021, allowed to go into effect, nearly 10 months before it overruled Roe v. Wade. As Justice Elena Kagan charged in her short dissent on the court\u2019s refusal to intervene in the Texas case, the conservative majority\u2019s behavior on the shadow docket had become increasingly \u201cunreasoned, inconsistent and impossible to defend.\u201d",
      "But then something strange happened: In a little-noticed October 2021 ruling refusing to block Maine\u2019s Covid vaccine mandate for health care workers, Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote a cryptic concurrence (which Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined) suggesting that just because an applicant had made a case for emergency relief from the court didn\u2019t mean the justices had to intervene. Rather, the court should use its discretion, she argued, much as it does in deciding the cases to which it will give full consideration. She didn\u2019t say what would guide that discretion, but her brief concurrence was a turning point. To underscore that, in spring of 2022 in an emergency relief case involving environmental regulation, Chief Justice John Roberts strikingly joined a dissent by Justice Kagan, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, emphasizing concerns about the procedural shortcuts the other conservative justices had been taking.",
      "Since then, the court has intervened far less often and in ways that have looked far less partisan even when it has granted emergency relief.",
      "Consider the court\u2019s decision last month to preserve nationwide access to the abortion drug mifepristone \u2014 a ruling from which only Justices Clarence Thomas and Alito publicly dissented. What changed some of the conservative justices\u2019 minds? We\u2019ll never know for sure, but the biggest thing that happened between the rulings in the Texas abortion case on Sept. 1, 2021, and in the Maine vaccine case on Oct. 29, 2021, was the tremendous public reaction to the earlier one. The Texas ruling brought the shadow docket into the mainstream \u2014 and the mainstream media, as an article published by The Chicago Policy Review noted. The consequences of the court\u2019s shadow docket behavior became highly visible for nonexperts to see. And once the shadow docket went mainstream, public backlash followed.",
      "We will all disagree as to whether public criticism of the court in specific contexts is fair. But what can\u2019t be denied is that public pressure on the court has been, both historically and recently, a meaningful check on the institution\u2019s excesses \u2014 and an essential means by which the public is able to hold unelected and otherwise unaccountable judges and justices to account.",
      "In the case of the shadow docket, it has led the court to tamp down its aggressiveness and try to provide more explanations for its less justified interventions. In the hotly debated case of ethics reform going on now, all nine justices have already publicly committed to following at least broad ethical norms. The court can go further, and it can (and should) adopt formal internal mechanisms to enforce whatever rules the justices agree to bind themselves to \u2014 much in the way that internal inspectors general hold the executive and legislative branches to account.",
      "The point is not that any one set of reforms is a magic bullet. Rather, it is that a court whose legitimacy depends at least to some degree on public support is not, should not be and never has been immune to criticism and pressure from the same public."

      "The actual launch of DeSantis\u2019s presidential campaign, in a \u201cTwitter Spaces\u201d event that crashed repeatedly and played to a smaller audience than he would have claimed just by showing up on Fox, instead offered the political version of the lesson that we\u2019ve been taught repeatedly by Musk\u2019s stewardship of Twitter: The internet can be a trap.",
      "For the Tesla and SpaceX mogul, the trap was sprung because Musk wanted to attack the groupthink of liberal institutions, and seeing that groupthink manifest on his favorite social media site, he imagined that owning Twitter was the key to transforming public discourse.",
      "But for all its influence, social media is still downstream of other institutions \u2014 universities, newspapers, television channels, movie studios, other internet platforms. Twitter is real life, but only through its relationship to other realities; it doesn\u2019t have the capacity to be a hub of discourse, news gathering or entertainment on its own. And many of Musk\u2019s difficulties as the Twitter C.E.O. have reflected a simple overestimation of social media\u2019s inherent authority and influence.",
      "Thus he\u2019s tried to sell the privilege of verification, the famous \u201cblue checks,\u201d without recognizing that they were valued because of their connection to real-world institutions and lose value if they reflect a Twitter hierarchy alone. Or he\u2019s encouraged his favored journalists to publish their scoops and essays on his site when it isn\u2019t yet built out for that kind of publication. Or he\u2019s encouraged media figures like Tucker Carlson and now politicians like DeSantis to run shows or do interviews on his platform, without having the infrastructure in place to make all that work.",
      "It\u2019s entirely possible that Musk can build out that infrastructure eventually, and make Twitter more capacious than it is today. But there isn\u2019t some immediate social-media shortcut to the influence he\u2019s seeking. If you want Twitter to be the world\u2019s news hub, you probably need a Twitter newsroom. If you want Twitter to host presidential candidates, you probably need a Twitter channel that feels like a professional newscast. And while you\u2019re trying to build those things, you need to be careful that the nature of social media doesn\u2019t diminish you to the kind of caricatured role \u2014 troll instead of tycoon \u2014 that tempts everyone on Twitter.",
      "That kind of diminishment is what the Twitter event handed to DeSantis, whose choppy launch may be forgotten but who would be wise to learn from what went wrong. There\u2019s an emerging criticism of the Florida governor that suggests that his whole persona is too online \u2014 that his talk about wokeness, wokeness, wokeness is pitched to a narrow and internet-based faction within the G.O.P., that he\u2019s setting himself to be like Elizabeth Warren in 2020, whose promise of plans, plans, plans thrilled the wonk faction but fell flat with normal Democratic voters.",
      "I think this critique is overdrawn. If you look at polling of Republican primary voters, the culture war appears to be a general concern rather than an elite fixation, and there\u2019s a plausible argument that the conflict with the new progressivism is the main thing binding the G.O.P. coalition together.",
      "But it does seem true that the conflict with progressivism in the context of social media is a more boutique taste, and that lots of anti-woke conservatives aren\u2019t particularly invested in whether the previous Twitter regime was throttling such-and-such right-wing influencer or taking orders from such-and-such \u201cdisinformation\u201d specialist.

The Florida governor\u2019s best self-advertisement in a primary should be his promise to be more active in reality than Trump, with his claim to be better at actual governance made manifest through his advantage in flesh-pressing, campaign-trail-hitting energy.",

      "If you had told me several months ago, immediately after Elon Musk bought Twitter and Ron DeSantis celebrated a thumping re-election victory, that DeSantis would launch his presidential campaign in conversation with Musk, I would have thought, intriguing: The rightward-trending billionaire whose rockets and cars stand out in an economy dominated by apps and financial instruments meets the Republican politician whose real-world victories contrast with the virtual populism of Donald Trump.",
      "The actual launch of DeSantis\u2019s presidential campaign, in a \u201cTwitter Spaces\u201d event that crashed repeatedly and played to a smaller audience than he would have claimed just by showing up on Fox, instead offered the political version of the lesson that we\u2019ve been taught repeatedly by Musk\u2019s stewardship of Twitter: The internet can be a trap.",
      "For the Tesla and SpaceX mogul, the trap was sprung because Musk wanted to attack the groupthink of liberal institutions, and seeing that groupthink manifest on his favorite social media site, he imagined that owning Twitter was the key to transforming public discourse.",
      "But for all its influence, social media is still downstream of other institutions \u2014 universities, newspapers, television channels, movie studios, other internet platforms. Twitter is real life, but only through its relationship to other realities; it doesn\u2019t have the capacity to be a hub of discourse, news gathering or entertainment on its own. And many of Musk\u2019s difficulties as the Twitter C.E.O. have reflected a simple overestimation of social media\u2019s inherent authority and influence.",
      "Thus he\u2019s tried to sell the privilege of verification, the famous \u201cblue checks,\u201d without recognizing that they were valued because of their connection to real-world institutions and lose value if they reflect a Twitter hierarchy alone. Or he\u2019s encouraged his favored journalists to publish their scoops and essays on his site when it isn\u2019t yet built out for that kind of publication. Or he\u2019s encouraged media figures like Tucker Carlson and now politicians like DeSantis to run shows or do interviews on his platform, without having the infrastructure in place to make all that work.",
      "It\u2019s entirely possible that Musk can build out that infrastructure eventually, and make Twitter more capacious than it is today. But there isn\u2019t some immediate social-media shortcut to the influence he\u2019s seeking. If you want Twitter to be the world\u2019s news hub, you probably need a Twitter newsroom. If you want Twitter to host presidential candidates, you probably need a Twitter channel that feels like a professional newscast. And while you\u2019re trying to build those things, you need to be careful that the nature of social media doesn\u2019t diminish you to the kind of caricatured role \u2014 troll instead of tycoon \u2014 that tempts everyone on Twitter.",
      "That kind of diminishment is what the Twitter event handed to DeSantis, whose choppy launch may be forgotten but who would be wise to learn from what went wrong. There\u2019s an emerging criticism of the Florida governor that suggests that his whole persona is too online \u2014 that his talk about wokeness, wokeness, wokeness is pitched to a narrow and internet-based faction within the G.O.P., that he\u2019s setting himself to be like Elizabeth Warren in 2020, whose promise of plans, plans, plans thrilled the wonk faction but fell flat with normal Democratic voters.",
      "I think this critique is overdrawn. If you look at polling of Republican primary voters, the culture war appears to be a general concern rather than an elite fixation, and there\u2019s a plausible argument that the conflict with the new progressivism is the main thing binding the G.O.P. coalition together.",
      "But it does seem true that the conflict with progressivism in the context of social media is a more boutique taste, and that lots of anti-woke conservatives aren\u2019t particularly invested in whether the previous Twitter regime was throttling such-and-such right-wing influencer or taking orders from such-and-such \u201cdisinformation\u201d specialist. And it\u2019s also true that DeSantis is running against a candidate who, at any moment, can return to Twitter and bestride its feeds like a colossus, no matter whatever Republican alternative the \u201cchief twit\u201d might prefer.",
      "So introducing himself in that online space made DeSantis look unnecessarily small \u2014 smaller than Musk\u2019s presence and Trump\u2019s absence, shrunk down to the scale of debates about shadow banning and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The Florida governor\u2019s best self-advertisement in a primary should be his promise to be more active in reality than Trump, with his claim to be better at actual governance made manifest through his advantage in flesh-pressing, campaign-trail-hitting energy.",
      "The good news for DeSantis is that he doesn\u2019t have billions invested in a social media company, so having endured a diminishing introduction, he can slip the trap and walk away \u2014 toward the crowds, klieg lights and the grass.",

      "The actual launch of DeSantis\u2019s presidential campaign, in a \u201cTwitter Spaces\u201d event that crashed repeatedly and played to a smaller audience than he would have claimed just by showing up on Fox, instead offered the political version of the lesson that we\u2019ve been taught repeatedly by Musk\u2019s stewardship of Twitter: The internet can be a trap.",
      "For the Tesla and SpaceX mogul, the trap was sprung because Musk wanted to attack the groupthink of liberal institutions, and seeing that groupthink manifest on his favorite social media site, he imagined that owning Twitter was the key to transforming public discourse.",
      "But for all its influence, social media is still downstream of other institutions \u2014 universities, newspapers, television channels, movie studios, other internet platforms. Twitter is real life, but only through its relationship to other realities; it doesn\u2019t have the capacity to be a hub of discourse, news gathering or entertainment on its own. And many of Musk\u2019s difficulties as the Twitter C.E.O. have reflected a simple overestimation of social media\u2019s inherent authority and influence.",

Or he\u2019s encouraged his favored journalists to publish their scoops and essays on his site when it isn\u2019t yet built out for that kind of publication.

If I were sitting in the Oval Office right now, I would be concerned about the public\u2019s fairly gloomy answers.",

(The unemployment rate in April, 3.4 percent, tied for the lowest since 1969.) My Opinion colleague Paul Krugman speculated recently that negative media coverage, pessimism from economists and partisanship helped explain the divergence.",

The survey found that 66 percent of Americans stopped using a product or used less of it because of inflation, while 51 percent reduced their savings in response to higher prices.

Only 63 percent said they would pay for it using cash, savings or a credit card that they would fully pay off at the next statement. While that was better than the 50 percent who said in 2013 that they would do so, it\u2019s still a shockingly small share. The rest said they would have to borrow, sell something or simply not pay the expense. And remember that inflation has made $400 emergency expenses more common.",

Some may benefit from recent economic growth and job stability, leading to a perception that the national economy is doing well. However, others may experience a decline in their quality of life due to rising prices, causing them to view the national economy more negatively. Therefore, it is crucial for policymakers to address inflation, as it is an important determinant of Americans' economic well-being and spending habits."

The survey found that 66 percent of Americans stopped using a product or used less of it because of inflation, while 51 percent reduced their savings in response to higher prices. Among people without health insurance, 42 percent went without medical treatment because they couldn\u2019t afford it, versus 26 percent among the insured.",
      "A useful function of surveys such as this one is to remind us how many Americans struggle to get by even when the economy is growing. Numbers that are pointing in the right direction are still pretty bad. For example, the Fed survey asked people how they would cover an emergency expense of $400. Only 63 percent said they would pay for it using cash, savings or a credit card that they would fully pay off at the next statement. While that was better than the 50 percent who said in 2013 that they would do so, it\u2019s still a shockingly small share. The rest said they would have to borrow, sell something or simply not pay the expense. And remember that inflation has made $400 emergency expenses more common.",

Least likely to regret their choices were engineering majors. Here\u2019s the whole chart:",

      "The study by the Federal Reserve suggests that different fields of study can impact an individual's likelihood of regretting their educational choice. For instance, those who pursue degrees in fields deemed less practical or less profitable may regret their choice more often than those who pursue degrees in fields with greater job prospects. In addition, students who take on significant debt to fund their education may be more likely to regret their choice if they struggle to find employment or earn low wages.",
      "Other contributing factors to an individual's likelihood of regretting their educational choice include the quality of the education they received, the fit between their personal interests and the subject matter covered in their degree program, and the ability to find employment in their field after graduation. Furthermore, the current job market, with its focus on practical skills and technical knowledge, may also contribute to an individual's likelihood of regretting their choice if they feel their degree did not adequately prepare them for the job market."

In exchange for adopting a series of procedures designed to make imposition of the death penalty less arbitrary (at least in appearance), dozens of states and Congress aggressively pushed the court to reauthorize capital punishment.

Rather, the court should use its discretion, she argued, much as it does in deciding the cases to which it will give full consideration. She didn\u2019t say what would guide that discretion, but her brief concurrence was a turning point.

When the justices effectively imposed a nationwide moratorium on capital punishment in 1972, the political backlash was extraordinary \u2014 at both the state and the federal level. In exchange for adopting a series of procedures designed to make imposition of the death penalty less arbitrary (at least in appearance), dozens of states and Congress aggressively pushed the court to reauthorize capital punishment. On July 2, 1976, the court acquiesced.",
      "In the past 18 months, we\u2019ve seen a similar \u2014 if subtler \u2014 shift in the court\u2019s behavior that again closely correlates with public criticism and pushback. In this case, it has been related to how the justices issue unsigned and (usually) unexplained orders concerning applications for emergency relief, on what Will Baude, a University of Chicago law professor, first called \u201cthe shadow docket.\u201d",
      "Starting in 2017, there was a great shift in how the conservative majority used unsigned, unexplained orders, especially in the context of applications for emergency relief (to freeze or unfreeze lower-court rulings while a case works its way through the courts). Far more than ever before, the justices started using these orders in ways that had nationwide implications \u2014 allowing, for example, President Donald Trump to carry out a series of immigration policies that lower courts had struck down (and no court would ever uphold) and blocking a series of Covid mitigation measures in blue states on novel religious liberty grounds.",
      "By contrast, the court showed nowhere near the same appetite to intervene to protect President Biden\u2019s policies or to block controversial laws in red states \u2014 like Texas\u2019 six-week abortion ban, which the court, in September 2021, allowed to go into effect, nearly 10 months before it overruled Roe v. Wade. As Justice Elena Kagan charged in her short dissent on the court\u2019s refusal to intervene in the Texas case, the conservative majority\u2019s behavior on the shadow docket had become increasingly \u201cunreasoned, inconsistent and impossible to defend.\u201d",
      "But then something strange happened: In a little-noticed October 2021 ruling refusing to block Maine\u2019s Covid vaccine mandate for health care workers, Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote a cryptic concurrence (which Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined) suggesting that just because an applicant had made a case for emergency relief from the court didn\u2019t mean the justices had to intervene. Rather, the court should use its discretion, she argued, much as it does in deciding the cases to which it will give full consideration. She didn\u2019t say what would guide that discretion, but her brief concurrence was a turning point. To underscore that, in spring of 2022 in an emergency relief case involving environmental regulation, Chief Justice John Roberts strikingly joined a dissent by Justice Kagan, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, emphasizing concerns about the procedural shortcuts the other conservative justices had been taking.",
      "Since then, the court has intervened far less often and in ways that have looked far less partisan even when it has granted emergency relief.",

What changed some of the conservative justices\u2019 minds? We\u2019ll never know for sure, but the biggest thing that happened between the rulings in the Texas abortion case on Sept. 1, 2021, and in the Maine vaccine case on Oct. 29, 2021, was the tremendous public reaction to the earlier one. The Texas ruling brought the shadow docket into the mainstream \u2014 and the mainstream media, as an article published by The Chicago Policy Review noted. The consequences of the court\u2019s shadow docket behavior became highly visible for nonexperts to see. And once the shadow docket went mainstream, public backlash followed.",
      "We will all disagree as to whether public criticism of the court in specific contexts is fair. But what can\u2019t be denied is that public pressure on the court has been, both historically and recently, a meaningful check on the institution\u2019s excesses \u2014 and an essential means by which the public is able to hold unelected and otherwise unaccountable judges and justices to account.",
      "In the case of the shadow docket, it has led the court to tamp down its aggressiveness and try to provide more explanations for its less justified interventions. In the hotly debated case of ethics reform going on now, all nine justices have already publicly committed to following at least broad ethical norms. The court can go further, and it can (and should) adopt formal internal mechanisms to enforce whatever rules the justices agree to bind themselves to \u2014 much in the way that internal inspectors general hold the executive and legislative branches to account.",

      "This allowed for the implementation of controversial policies, such as President Trump's immigration policies and the blocking of Covid mitigation measures in blue states.",
      "However, the court did not intervene to protect President Biden's policies or block controversial laws in red states.",
      "In a 2021 ruling, Justice Barrett suggested that the court should use its discretion in deciding whether to grant emergency relief.",
      "Since then, the court has intervened less often and in ways that appear less partisan.",
      "In June 2021, the court granted emergency relief to preserve nationwide access to the abortion drug mifepristone, with only Justices Thomas and Alito dissenting.",
      "These recent developments indicate that the Supreme Court is responding to public criticism and pushback and taking steps to address concerns about partisanship and bias in its decision-making."

      "1. One factor that may affect the outcome of the upcoming election in Adiyaman is the government's response to the earthquakes that struck the region in February 2021. While some residents are hesitant to vote for President Erdogan's party due to the slow response and ongoing rebuilding efforts, the temporary housing and promises of aid from the government and opposition parties may sway some voters. The government's handling of the earthquake crisis could play a role in determining the outcome of the election.",
      "2. Another factor to consider is the personal experiences of individual residents in Adiyaman. For example, Zeynep, a housewife, favors the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party, HDP, in part due to her husband's involvement in the ongoing conflict with Kurdish insurgents. These personal experiences and connections to various issues may influence how residents vote.",
      "3. The diversity of political opinions and preferences among Adiyaman residents may also impact the election. For instance, Ekrem Abaci, a neighborhood representative, believes the government has taken care of the people, while Hakan, a graduate student with a broken arm, plans to vote against nepotism and bureaucratic rot that have left him unemployed. This demonstrates that not all residents in Adiyaman will vote in the same way and that the election may be influenced by a range of factors."

      "Almost a year has passed since the Bureau of Economic Analysis announced that the U.S. economy had contracted for two quarters in a row. Some people believe, wrongly, that two quarters of falling G.D.P. is the official definition of a recession. Economic negativity ran rampant, especially but not only on the political right.",
      "The interesting question now is why, at least according to some surveys, the public remains very negative on the economy \u2014 as negative as it has been in the past amid severe economic downturns \u2014 even though those recession calls were clearly a false alarm, and the economy is actually looking remarkably strong. Or maybe the question should be why people say that they\u2019re very negative on the economy.",
      "This is a touchy subject, albeit one I\u2019ve commented on before. You don\u2019t want to say that Americans are stupid; you certainly don\u2019t want to sound like that John McCain adviser who insisted that America was a \u201cnation of whiners\u201d who were experiencing only a \u201cmental recession.\u201d",
      "On the other hand, there are now huge gaps between what people say about the economy and both what the data says and what they say about their own experience. And we have some new information on what lies behind these gaps.",
      "First, about that much-hyped \u201cBiden recession.\u201d The actual definition of a recession involves several economic indicators, and aside from those G.D.P. numbers, nothing that has happened to the economy looks remotely like a recession.",
      "Since December 2021 the U.S. economy has added almost six million jobs while the unemployment rate has fallen from 3.9 percent to 3.4 percent, a level not seen since the 1960s. And no, unemployment isn\u2019t low because Americans have dropped out of the labor force: The percentage of adults either working or looking for a job has declined, but that\u2019s almost entirely a result of an aging population, and labor force participation is right back in line with prepandemic projections.",
      "And these are good jobs, according to workers themselves. According to the Conference Board, which has been surveying job satisfaction since 1987, \u201cU.S. workers have never been more content.\u201d",
      "To be sure, the return of serious inflation after decades of quiescence rattled everyone, and not just because it reduced real incomes. (Real wages fell during Ronald Reagan\u2019s second term, but people felt pretty good about the economy anyway.) One benefit of low inflation is that it gives people one less thing to worry about; according to the American Psychological Association, inflation was a major source of stress during 2022.",
      "But inflation, while still elevated, has come way down. The inflation rate over the past six months was 3.3 percent, compared with 9.6 percent last June. The price of gasoline, a major political talking point last year, is now more or less normal compared with average earnings.",
      "And people have noticed. In October, 20 percent of Americans named inflation as the most important problem facing the nation; that\u2019s now down to 9 percent.",
      "So what\u2019s going on? The general rule seems to be that Americans are feeling good about their personal situation but believe that bad things are happening to other people. A Federal Reserve study found that in late 2021 a record-high percentage of Americans were positive about their own finances while a record low were positive about the economy. We don\u2019t have results for 2022 yet, but my guess is that they\u2019ll look similar.",
      "Partisanship surely explains much of this divergence. A newly published study shows that who holds the White House has huge effects on views of the economy; this is true for supporters of both parties, although the effect appears to be about twice as strong for Republicans. The study also finds, however, that these changes in reported views don\u2019t appear to have any effect on actual spending \u2014 that they reflect \u201ccheerleading,\u201d as opposed to \u201cactual expectations.\u201d",
      "Beyond that, there\u2019s good reason to believe that media reports about the economy have had a strongly negative bias. One thing that has gone really, really right in America lately is job creation, yet the public consistently reports having heard more negative than positive news about employment.",
      "And let\u2019s not let economists off the hook. As Mark Zandi of Moody\u2019s Analytics points out, many economists have been predicting recession month after month for the past year. Sooner or later, a recession will no doubt happen, but as he says, \u201cIn my 30-plus years as a professional economist, I\u2019ve never seen such recession pessimism,\u201d even as the economy has remained resilient. And this pessimism has surely filtered through to the public.",
      "So where does all this leave us? America hasn\u2019t yet brought inflation back to prepandemic levels, and we may yet have an economic hard landing. But so far, at least, we\u2019ve had a stunningly successful recovery from the Covid shock.",
      "While many Americans tell surveys that things are terrible \u2014 which says something about how people respond to surveys and where they get their information \u2014 this doesn\u2019t contradict that positive assessment."

      "1. While the recent data on job growth and falling unemployment rates are encouraging, there are certain factors that contribute to the public's continued negative perception of the economy. Firstly, the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic has left a lasting impact on individuals and businesses, resulting in widespread job losses and financial distress. This has led to a lingering sense of uncertainty and skepticism about the economy's recovery.",
      "1. Additionally, the perceived lack of progress in addressing systemic economic issues, such as income inequality and wealth disparities, also contributes to the negative perception. Despite the positive economic data, many individuals may still be experiencing economic hardship, leading to a sense of disconnect between the national economic data and their personal experiences.",
      "1. Lastly, the return of serious inflation after decades of quiescence has rattled consumers and businesses alike. As prices rise, individuals may feel squeezed and unable to keep up with the cost of living, leading to a perception of economic instability. These factors, combined with the lingering effects of the pandemic, may be contributing to the public's continued negative perception of the economy, despite evidence of a strong recovery."

      "Political beliefs can significantly influence individuals' perceptions of the economy, as they can shape one's overall worldview and inform their interpretation of economic data. Political ideology can also play a role in shaping one's attitudes towards economic policies and their effectiveness.",
      "One possible reason why some people insist on labeling any economic downturn as a \"recession\" is due to their political beliefs. Labeling an economic downturn as a recession can be seen as a way to express concern and garner attention for the issue, particularly if one believes that the government or other institutions are not doing enough to address economic challenges. Moreover, labeling an economic downturn as a recession can also serve to reinforce one's political narrative about the economy and economic policy.",
      "Another possible reason why some people insist on labeling an economic downturn as a recession is due to their lack of understanding of economic terminology and concepts. Inaccurate or misunderstood economic terminology can lead to misconceptions and confusion about the state of the economy, and can contribute to negative perceptions of the economy, even when objective data suggests otherwise.",
      "Ultimately, individuals' perceptions of the economy are shaped by a complex interplay of factors, including political beliefs, subjective experiences, and cultural context. Understanding these factors is important for developing effective economic policies and promoting economic prosperity."

      "The media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion about the economy, and biased reporting can significantly contribute to negative perceptions. While economic indicators such as job growth and falling unemployment rates are positive, the public's perception of the economy remains negative. Biased reporting can create this disconnect by focusing only on the negative aspects of the economy, such as rising inflation, while ignoring the positive indicators. This can cause the public to overlook the progress made in the economy and focus solely on the negative aspects.",
      "Moreover, the media can create a sense of anxiety and uncertainty in the public by sensationalizing economic issues and presenting them as urgent problems that require immediate attention. This can lead to negative perceptions about the economy, even when economic indicators suggest otherwise. In addition, biased reporting can contribute to the reinforcement of negative stereotypes and beliefs about certain groups in the economy, such as workers or small business owners. This can create a cycle of negative perceptions about the economy that is difficult to break.",
      "To ensure that the media is not shaping public opinion in a negative way, it is important for journalists to be knowledgeable about the economy and to present a balanced view of the issues. They should also be careful not to sensationalize economic issues and should provide context and explanation to help the public understand complex economic concepts. This can help to create a more accurate and balanced view of the economy and reduce negative perceptions."

This can be achieved by using accessible language in its publications and public statements, and by engaging in more frequent and direct communication with the public through town hall meetings, social media platforms, and other channels. Additionally, the Fed could consider conducting surveys to gauge public sentiment and tailor its communication strategy based on the feedback received.",

The most recent innovation has been tamer: People have banged pots whenever the president has appeared. The cause? President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s measure raising the retirement age from 62 to 64.",
      "This might at first glance appear to be the work of a vibrant political left wing, fighting pro-business, anti-worker policies from a center-right technocratic government. Indeed, France\u2019s labor unions \u2014 though representing a smaller share of the work force than elsewhere in Western Europe \u2014 have been united in their opposition, making them a redoubtable force. Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, who leads the left-wing coalition NUPES, has been a central figure in the parliamentary fight against Mr. Macron, nearly bringing down his government with a no-confidence vote in March.",
      "And yet it is not France\u2019s left that has benefited from the popular rebellion. It is the far right.",
      "Recent polls showed that if last year\u2019s head-to-head presidential election were held now, Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right Rassemblement National, would beat Mr. Macron handily, 55 to 45 percent. Other polls that list all possible candidates have shown that Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, despite his and his group\u2019s support for the anti-Macron movement, has gained a mere percentage point since last year\u2019s elections, hovering at around a quarter of the votes and, in some scenarios, only 20 percent.",
      "In a situation that seems tailor-made for a resurgence of the left, how is it that, for the moment, at least, it is not just the right but the far right that has benefited?",
      "Hatred of the established order is no longer a marker of leftism, and France\u2019s recent history testifies to this. The Yellow Vests, France\u2019s last mass protest movement, which began in response to an eco-friendly hike in gas taxes in 2018, was a strange hodgepodge of positions and attitudes, and its political leanings varied from city to city and even differed from one roundabout to another where the protesters gathered.",
      "The movement rejected attempts by politicians to join them and very early developed a solid right-leaning conspiratorial element. Jacline Mouraud, whose October 2018 video helped spark the movement, later supported the far-right presidential candidate Eric Zemmour, a committed racist. A direct outgrowth of the Yellow Vests was the phenomenal popularity of the 2020 Covid conspiracy film \u201cHold Up,\u201d as was a vocal anti-mask movement.",
      "The right-wing populist current in the Yellow Vests from just a few years ago has not vanished, and it is making itself felt in the new polls. The Rassemblement National has been the face of the populist right since its beginnings, and its history has been one of growth. These polls are a sign that this move has continued, to the benefit of Ms. Le Pen.",

How the increase in retirement age was finally made law \u2014 bypassing a vote in the National Assembly \u2014 was seen as a confirmation of Mr. Macron\u2019s undemocratic, even authoritarian tendencies. The political center and center right have been neutralized by their support for the president\u2019s unpopular measure. In response, the center and center right are on the attack. It is their opponents, the centrists say, who are the true threat to democracy: the left for its support of violent protests and the far right by its very nature. Mr. Macron\u2019s ministers hammer away at this idea in the media.",
      "For its part, the left has been hampered by its own inadequacies. Mr. M\u00e9lenchon and his coalition, betting heavily that anti-Macron sentiment will benefit them, have lacked a coherent strategy, other than maintaining pressure through advocating increased mobilization while adopting disruptive tactics in the National Assembly. Last October, well before the current crisis, polls showed that their rowdiness during legislative sessions had already led many to think left-wing politicians were incapable of governing. This political mayhem has thus far helped only the Rassemblement National, which is no longer universally viewed as a political pariah.",
      "Ms. Le Pen and her party, remarkably, have become, in the eyes of many, the voice of la France profonde, the voice of reason.

      "The most recent ABC News/Washington Post poll found that 63 percent of those surveyed thought Biden didn\u2019t have the mental sharpness to serve effectively; 43 percent said the same of Donald Trump, even though their ages are only a few years apart.",
      "Let me say up front that a candidate\u2019s age and competency are always fair game in politics. It\u2019s not ageist to acknowledge the scientific reality that our bodies and minds decline in capacity as we age. It\u2019s not ageist for voters to factor that into their electoral decisions. And aging is individual: Some people appear vibrant at 80 and others worn at 50.",
      "But there are also other truths that must be considered. Headlines and polls don\u2019t just measure and reflect public sentiment; they also influence it. The persistence of a theme elevates and validates that theme.",
      "As Jocelyn Kiley, associate director of research at Pew Research Center, told me: \u201cAs with anything in journalism, more broadly, as there\u2019s a great deal of a spotlight on a topic, it raises the salience of that topic for the public, and people are more likely to consider things that are in the news as important.\u201d",
      "I also think that we as citizens and consumers of media like to think that we come to our opinions and beliefs completely on our own, and we resist the notion that those opinions have been influenced or manipulated by outside forces. But there is a growing body of research that demonstrates the opposite. We are, unquestionably, influenced by the media.",
      "This brings me to the coverage of Biden\u2019s age. It\u2019s true that if he\u2019s re-elected, Biden would be the oldest president we\u2019ve ever had. But he was already the oldest president the first time he was elected. What changed?",
      "I\u2019d argue that the biggest change wasn\u2019t the simple passage of time, but the decision of some Republican leaders to focus like a laser on Biden\u2019s age as the factor weighing against him. In an April interview, the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley said it was unlikely Biden would \u201cmake it\u201d through a second term. In this year\u2019s Republican response to the State of the Union address, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Arkansas noted that she\u2019s half Biden\u2019s age.",
      "Some observers contend that voting for Biden is essentially voting for Vice President Kamala Harris to be president, because Biden may not last another term. For Republicans, that notion offers the added benefit of allowing them to campaign against the trifecta of their disdain \u2014 a liberal who\u2019s a minority and a woman.",
      "Which brings us back to the web of influence: Campaigns elevate an issue, pollsters and journalists ask whether the issue is having an effect on a race, stories are written about that effect, and as a result of the coverage, the effect is often intensified. That is the chain of custody for a political attack, but far too often, that connection and context aren\u2019t made clear. It\u2019s often presented as if these types of concerns just spring forth in voters\u2019 minds and aren\u2019t influenced by campaigns and news coverage.",
      "This happens all the time in politics.",
      "Before the 2018 midterm elections, Trump decided once again to whip up Americans\u2019 xenophobia by harping on a caravan of migrants, an \u201cinvasion\u201d he called it, heading for our southern border.",
      "Less than a month before those midterms, The Times reported, \u201cFor the last two weeks, Mr. Trump and his conservative allies have operated largely in tandem on social media and elsewhere to push alarmist, conspiratorial warnings about the migrant caravan more than 2,000 miles from the border.\u201d The Times concluded that they had largely succeeded in animating Republican voters \u201caround the idea of these foreign nationals posing a dire threat to the country\u2019s security, stability and identity.\u201d",
      "This caravan drew headlines and consumed airtime. And there was at least one poll taken about the threats people thought the caravans posed. According to Politico, Trump \u201cseized\u201d on the caravan issue after his team reviewed polling from congressional districts that were competitive in the 2016 election and found that border issues resonated with voters in those districts.",
      "But when the midterms were over, Trump backburnered the caravan issue and so did the media, as Quartz reported. And as the publication pointed out, \u201cAttention from Trump and other Republicans helped drive the media coverage of the caravan, and cable news and newspapers either repeated the calls of alarm, or sought to ease concerns.\u201d",
      "If the caravans had been entirely of organic interest to the public, more robust coverage probably would have continued. Instead, in that case, we saw how a political party weaponized a topic and the media helped deploy the weapon.",
      "This doesn\u2019t mean that immigration and border security aren\u2019t independently newsworthy, but rather that the media doesn\u2019t simply cover campaigns; editorial decisions can be influenced by those campaigns and coverage can influence voters as much as it informs them.",
      "This is playing out again. The idea that voters are worried about Biden\u2019s age and capacity has been repeated so often that it no longer requires any proof beyond polling that reflects what respondents have consumed: reports that they\u2019re worried about Biden\u2019s age and capacity.",
      "There\u2019s a real chicken-egg conundrum here.",
      "And as Nate Silver, the founder of FiveThirtyEight, who generally believes media should \u201cfocus more and not less on the health and mental fitness of elected officials,\u201d told me via email, it\u2019s unclear how much the age issue will affect votes for Biden, anyway. As Silver put it: \u201cIn the abstract, voters raise high levels of concern but \u2014 they also did so in 2020 and he won both the primary and the general. And his approval ratings, while not great, are roughly in line with what you might expect given high polarization and high inflation.\u201d",
      "Breathless headlines have created a sense that worry about the president\u2019s age is common knowledge and common sense, when in fact it is, at least in part, fueled by political manipulation and media complicity."

Polls that show a majority of Americans view Biden's age as a factor in his performance also contribute to this perception.",
      "Republican leaders have also been successful in using the issue of Biden's age to their advantage, with some arguing that voting for Biden is equivalent to voting for Vice President Kamala Harris as the next president. The media amplifies these attacks, which can further sway public opinion against Biden.",
      "Moreover, media coverage that fails to clarify the campaigns and news coverage that influence public opinion about Biden's age can exacerbate the situation. By reporting on the effects of the media coverage without providing context, the media may inadvertently be contributing to a narrative that is being weaponized by political parties. This was seen in the 2018 midterm elections when Trump used the migrant caravan issue to whip up xenophobia with the help of conservative allies and media coverage. After the elections, the media and Trump moved on from the issue, but the damage to public opinion had already been done."

      "The relationship between political campaigns, the news media and the public isn\u2019t exactly an interplay between independent actors. It\u2019s a web of influence.",
      "This dynamic is particularly relevant when it comes to the avalanche of headlines and polls about President Biden\u2019s age.",
      "The most recent ABC News/Washington Post poll found that 63 percent of those surveyed thought Biden didn\u2019t have the mental sharpness to serve effectively; 43 percent said the same of Donald Trump, even though their ages are only a few years apart.",
      "Let me say up front that a candidate\u2019s age and competency are always fair game in politics. It\u2019s not ageist to acknowledge the scientific reality that our bodies and minds decline in capacity as we age. It\u2019s not ageist for voters to factor that into their electoral decisions. And aging is individual: Some people appear vibrant at 80 and others worn at 50.",
      "But there are also other truths that must be considered. Headlines and polls don\u2019t just measure and reflect public sentiment; they also influence it. The persistence of a theme elevates and validates that theme.",
      "As Jocelyn Kiley, associate director of research at Pew Research Center, told me: \u201cAs with anything in journalism, more broadly, as there\u2019s a great deal of a spotlight on a topic, it raises the salience of that topic for the public, and people are more likely to consider things that are in the news as important.\u201d",
      "I also think that we as citizens and consumers of media like to think that we come to our opinions and beliefs completely on our own, and we resist the notion that those opinions have been influenced or manipulated by outside forces. But there is a growing body of research that demonstrates the opposite. We are, unquestionably, influenced by the media.",
      "This brings me to the coverage of Biden\u2019s age. It\u2019s true that if he\u2019s re-elected, Biden would be the oldest president we\u2019ve ever had. But he was already the oldest president the first time he was elected. What changed?",
      "I\u2019d argue that the biggest change wasn\u2019t the simple passage of time, but the decision of some Republican leaders to focus like a laser on Biden\u2019s age as the factor weighing against him. In an April interview, the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley said it was unlikely Biden would \u201cmake it\u201d through a second term. In this year\u2019s Republican response to the State of the Union address, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Arkansas noted that she\u2019s half Biden\u2019s age.",
      "Some observers contend that voting for Biden is essentially voting for Vice President Kamala Harris to be president, because Biden may not last another term. For Republicans, that notion offers the added benefit of allowing them to campaign against the trifecta of their disdain \u2014 a liberal who\u2019s a minority and a woman.",
      "Which brings us back to the web of influence: Campaigns elevate an issue, pollsters and journalists ask whether the issue is having an effect on a race, stories are written about that effect, and as a result of the coverage, the effect is often intensified. That is the chain of custody for a political attack, but far too often, that connection and context aren\u2019t made clear. It\u2019s often presented as if these types of concerns just spring forth in voters\u2019 minds and aren\u2019t influenced by campaigns and news coverage.",
      "This happens all the time in politics.",
      "Before the 2018 midterm elections, Trump decided once again to whip up Americans\u2019 xenophobia by harping on a caravan of migrants, an \u201cinvasion\u201d he called it, heading for our southern border.",
      "Less than a month before those midterms, The Times reported, \u201cFor the last two weeks, Mr. Trump and his conservative allies have operated largely in tandem on social media and elsewhere to push alarmist, conspiratorial warnings about the migrant caravan more than 2,000 miles from the border.\u201d The Times concluded that they had largely succeeded in animating Republican voters \u201caround the idea of these foreign nationals posing a dire threat to the country\u2019s security, stability and identity.\u201d",
      "This caravan drew headlines and consumed airtime. And there was at least one poll taken about the threats people thought the caravans posed. According to Politico, Trump \u201cseized\u201d on the caravan issue after his team reviewed polling from congressional districts that were competitive in the 2016 election and found that border issues resonated with voters in those districts.",
      "But when the midterms were over, Trump backburnered the caravan issue and so did the media, as Quartz reported. And as the publication pointed out, \u201cAttention from Trump and other Republicans helped drive the media coverage of the caravan, and cable news and newspapers either repeated the calls of alarm, or sought to ease concerns.\u201d",
      "If the caravans had been entirely of organic interest to the public, more robust coverage probably would have continued. Instead, in that case, we saw how a political party weaponized a topic and the media helped deploy the weapon.",
      "This doesn\u2019t mean that immigration and border security aren\u2019t independently newsworthy, but rather that the media doesn\u2019t simply cover campaigns; editorial decisions can be influenced by those campaigns and coverage can influence voters as much as it informs them.",
      "This is playing out again. The idea that voters are worried about Biden\u2019s age and capacity has been repeated so often that it no longer requires any proof beyond polling that reflects what respondents have consumed: reports that they\u2019re worried about Biden\u2019s age and capacity.",
      "There\u2019s a real chicken-egg conundrum here.",
      "And as Nate Silver, the founder of FiveThirtyEight, who generally believes media should \u201cfocus more and not less on the health and mental fitness of elected officials,\u201d told me via email, it\u2019s unclear how much the age issue will affect votes for Biden, anyway. As Silver put it: \u201cIn the abstract, voters raise high levels of concern but \u2014 they also did so in 2020 and he won both the primary and the general. And his approval ratings, while not great, are roughly in line with what you might expect given high polarization and high inflation.\u201d",
      "Breathless headlines have created a sense that worry about the president\u2019s age is common knowledge and common sense, when in fact it is, at least in part, fueled by political manipulation and media complicity."

His past actions indicate a history of misinformation and polarizing discourse, and providing him with a platform to continue this behavior may normalize and perpetuate these harmful actions. Additionally, his leadership style and behavior could set a dangerous precedent for future political candidates, potentially legitimizing unethical and undemocratic practices.",
      "2. By allowing Donald Trump to participate in town hall events and giving him equal treatment as other candidates, the media may inadvertently be providing him with more exposure and free publicity. This could further boost his visibility and popularity among his supporters, potentially strengthening his position in the polls and prolonging his influence on the political scene. This could lead to negative consequences for the democratic process and the country as a whole, as Trump's brand of politics is known for being divisive, authoritarian, and in opposition to many of the norms and values that underpin a healthy democracy.",

The normalization of Donald Trump's behavior and political views through town hall events and media coverage may serve as a catalyst for further polarization and extremism in American politics. By giving him a platform to spew his rhetoric, the media may inadvertently be fueling a climate of hate and division, which could lead to more violence and social unrest. This could have long-term consequences for the political landscape, as well as for the social and economic stability of the country. As such, it is crucial for the media, democratic institutions, and voters to exercise their duty in a responsible and ethical manner, and to counteract the harmful effects of such exposure."

The news media has a responsibility to hold Trump accountable by pressing him on his past actions and exposing any potential lies or misinformation.",
      "It is important to note that Trump's participation in the town hall event does not mean that the news media is giving him a free pass. It is their duty to fact-check his statements and call him out when he spreads false information.

      "Title: Assessing Donald Trump's Candidacy Fairly: The Importance of Media and Institutional Responsibility",
      "The enduring appeal of Donald Trump to millions of Americans, despite his controversial past, presents a challenge in assessing his candidacy fairly and objectively. To tackle this issue, voters, the news media, and democratic institutions have a duty to treat Mr. Trump's candidacy critically and fairly.",
      "First, voters must carefully evaluate Mr. Trump's policies, track record, and character. The enduring appeal of his message cannot be dismissed, but it is crucial to separate his rhetoric from his actions. Political commentators argue that many Americans may be influenced by Mr. Trump's populist message, but this does not mean that his actions are beyond reproach. The key to assessing his candidacy fairly is to hold him accountable for his actions and not be swayed by his charisma or media presence.",
      "Second, the news media has an essential role in scrutinizing Mr. Trump's candidacy. It is important to recognize the media's responsibility in creating the platform for his rise to power. However, in reporting on Mr. Trump, the media must avoid giving him a free pass or sensationalizing his every move, which can create a false narrative of his appeal. Instead, the media should critically analyze his policies and privilege objective reporting over sensational headlines.",
      "Lastly, democratic institutions must be vigilant in holding Mr. Trump accountable for his actions. This includes ensuring a fair election process, legal due process when appropriate, and maintaining institutions that work for all Americans. The institutional check-and-balance role of Congress, the judiciary, and other governmental bodies must be exercised to promote a fair and objective assessment of Mr. Trump's candidacy.",
      "In conclusion, assessing Donald Trump's candidacy fairly and objectively is a collective responsibility of voters, the news media, and democratic institutions. By separating the messenger from the message, analyzing his policies, critically reporting on his actions, and upholding democratic principles, the public can make informed decisions based on facts, rather than hype or emotional appeal."

      "This is the least surprising move ever. Mr. Trump has always been a media creation. Without the \u201cfake news\u201d he so loves to bash, he\u2019d just be another failed real estate scion hawking mediocre steaks and worthless degrees from his \u201cuniversity.\u201d",
      "More specifically, Mr. Trump\u2019s people are flogging the idea that his willingness to play with the media is proof of his bravery and manliness. \u201cGoing outside the traditional Republican \u2018comfort zone\u2019 was a key to President Trump\u2019s success in 2016,\u201d one toady recently told The Hill. \u201cSome other candidates are too afraid to take this step in their quest to defeat Joe Biden and are afraid to do anything other than Fox News.\u201d",
      "Take that, \u201cPudding Fingers\u201d DeSantis.",
      "More targeted still: Mr. Trump\u2019s canoodling with CNN twists the knife in the gut of Fox News, which of late has not been obsequious enough for his taste. This isn\u2019t simply an issue of personal spite. Threatening/scaring/cajoling Fox News back into line is important to Mr. Trump\u2019s 2024 fortunes. Whatever the network\u2019s recent drama, there is no other conservative platform like it.",
      "It\u2019s hard to know how Mr. Trump\u2019s forays beyond his MAGA bubble will go, especially starting out. The guy was an appalling president, but he has always been a top-notch pitchman with a freaky sort of charisma. And a huge part of running for \u2014 and even being \u2014 president is compelling salesmanship. That said, he is out of practice interacting with people who aren\u2019t there simply to lick his boots. He has spent the past couple of years largely cocooned in a fantasyland of his own creation, which can be tough to come back from.",
      "That makes these early appearances all the more important. CNN has as much on the line on Wednesday as the candidate \u2014 maybe more. This is about more than real-time fact-checking the candidate, though it must be established early and firmly that no disinformation will go unrebutted. Mr. Trump cannot be allowed to grandstand or slither away from awkward topics: He needs to face tough and skeptical questioning from the get-go.",
      "I do wish that CNN had waited a bit longer before relaunching Mr. Trump. Firing up the prime-time campaign coverage machine this early in the cycle isn\u2019t healthy for the American psyche under normal circumstances, much less with this singularly toxic character in the mix.",
      "But now that the Trump Show is back, the media \u2014 everyone really \u2014 needs to be demanding more from this season than past ones. The former president should be expected to undergo the same vetting rituals as other candidates: debates, town halls, non-softball interviews, candidate cattle calls \u2014 the works. He cannot be left to the fuzzy realm of social media and schmoozing with Sean Hannity-style sycophants.",

Additionally, his age could be used against him by his opponents as a sign of a lack of fresh ideas and a change in leadership.",

      "Joe Biden is officially running for re-election, and his candidacy will put some Democratic voters \u2014 those not only skittish about his age but also about his passion for policy \u2014 in a vise: They recognize the threat from the leading Republican candidates, but they\u2019ve been underwhelmed by Biden, who\u2019d be 82 at the start of a second term.",
      "The age question is a major concern for Biden, according to political advisers I\u2019ve spoken to recently \u2014 and according to the chatter on cable news and online. And the sense that he has underwhelmed is particularly problematic for Biden when it comes to young voters. According to an Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School poll of 18-to 29-year-olds released Monday, just 36 percent of young Americans approve of Biden\u2019s job performance. That number has steadily dropped over the course of his presidency.",
      "Though young voters were only 17 percent of the 2020 electorate, they\u2019ll probably be a key to another Biden win, since he won about 60 percent of the 18-to-29 vote last time around. Younger voters can also be barometers of how much a candidate\u2019s passion factors into his appeal.",
      "I reached out to several voting rights advocates and political organizers to discuss Biden\u2019s bid, and the overall impression settles somewhere between cautious optimism and dampened enthusiasm not so much about Biden\u2019s age but about how voters, including younger voters, look at his policy priorities. As Clifford Albright, a co-founder and the executive director of the Black Voters Matter Fund, told me, although younger voters would generally like to see younger candidates, \u201cthe age thing can be overcome if you\u2019re talking about the right issues.\u201d",
      "Albright mentioned the presidential candidacies of Senator Bernie Sanders, who\u2019s about a year older than Biden. As a contender for the Democratic nomination, he said, Sanders was held aloft by young voters because he vociferously championed issues that they cared about. They felt that he was fighting for them.",
      "It\u2019s on those issues where some activists seemed to think Biden had left an opening for voter disappointment. They weren\u2019t na\u00efve about the structural obstacles in the way Congress operates that made legislative progress difficult, if not impossible, but they simply didn\u2019t believe that Biden went down fighting on some of the initiatives that younger Democratic voters cared about most.",
      "One that sticks in their craws, undoubtedly because they deal with voting rights, was a sense that Biden didn\u2019t fight hard enough for the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.",

      "The age question is a major concern for Biden, according to political advisers I\u2019ve spoken to recently \u2014 and according to the chatter on cable news and online. And the sense that he has underwhelmed is particularly problematic for Biden when it comes to young voters. According to an Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School poll of 18-to 29-year-olds released Monday, just 36 percent of young Americans approve of Biden\u2019s job performance. That number has steadily dropped over the course of his presidency.",

They felt that he was fighting for them.",

A half year later, these Democratic wins can feel like old news, but they were agenda items that Democratic voters, including young voters, cared deeply about.",

      "In their forthcoming book, \u201cBeyond Doubt: The Secularization of Society,\u201d the sociologists Isabella Kasselstrand, Phil Zuckerman and Ryan Cragun describe a change in the built environment of St. Louis that is \u201cemblematic\u201d of the ebb of organized religious observance in America. What was once a Gothic-style beauty of a Catholic church built in the 19th century by German immigrants had been turned into a skateboard park.",
      "\u201cIn the United States,\u201d the authors tell us, \u201csomewhere between 6,000 and 10,000 churches close down every year, either to be repurposed as apartments, laundries, laser-tag arenas, or skate parks, or to simply be demolished.\u201d (I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that my apartment was once the rectory of a church, also built in the 1800s and transformed, a couple of decades ago, into condos for yuppies who want dramatic windows and a hint of ecclesiastical flavor.)",
      "It\u2019s not just the frequency of churchgoing or temple membership that\u2019s declining in our country: Last month, The Wall Street Journal and NORC at the University of Chicago surveyed around 1,000 American adults about the importance of different values to Americans, including the importance of religion. In 2023, only 39 percent of respondents said religion was very important to them, compared to 62 percent who said that in 1998.",
      "When you look at the full results, the picture becomes a bit more complicated. Sixty percent of respondents said that religion was either somewhat or very important to them, and only 19 percent said religion was not important to them at all. The United States is still a more religiously observant country than our peer nations in Western Europe \u2014 according to Pew Research in 2018, for example, we are more likely to believe in God or some kind of higher power and more likely to pray daily.",
      "But two things can be true at the same time, said Mark Chaves, a professor of sociology at Duke Divinity School who directs the National Congregations Study: America can still be a comparatively observant nation and religious observance can be on the decline in various dimensions, happening at different paces, Chaves explains. \u201cThe decline in religious belief and interest is much slower than the decline in organizational participation,\u201d he said when we spoke.",
      "For example, few Americans say they don\u2019t believe in God at all, and while that minority has grown, it\u2019s still very small. According to NORC data, atheists only made up about 2 percent to 3 percent of the population from 1988 to 2012. By 2021, atheists were 7 percent of the population. In 1988, 17 percent of Americans said they never attended religious services. In 2021, that number was 31 percent.",
      "Religion\u2019s meaning to people goes well beyond regular attendance at a local church, temple or mosque, or trust in religious leaders. That\u2019s why polling questions don\u2019t always capture the whole picture of American religious observance. There\u2019s been a lot of coverage about the rise of what pollsters sometimes call \u201cnones\u201d \u2014 people who say they have no religion in particular, which, according to Gallup, went from 0 percent to 2 percent of the population in the early 1950s to plateauing at around 20 percent of the population from 2017 to 2022.",
      "But it would be incorrect to say that nones don\u2019t retain any trappings of religious observance, like belief in a higher power or performing certain rituals. It doesn\u2019t even mean they never attend church. As Zuckerman, one of the authors of \u201cBeyond Doubt\u201d and a professor at Pitzer College, explained to me over the phone, when social scientists talk about religion, they do it in terms of \u201cthe three B\u2019s: belief, behavior and belonging.\u201d If someone asks you about your religion and you say you don\u2019t have any, Zuckerman said, \u201cthat tells me nothing about your beliefs, and that tells me nothing about your behavior. It just tells me how you identify.\u201d",
      "Since I started reporting this story, I\u2019ve been asking members of my unobservant family what they\u2019d say if a pollster asked them what their religious affiliations are. (Aware of the caveat that both sociologists I talked to noted: Responses are often shaped by how the question is asked.)",
      "None of us have set foot in a temple or church in years. My mother and I both said we would identify as Jewish. My father \u2014 who has two Jewish parents and was bar mitzvahed \u2014 said he\u2019d identify as \u201cnothing\u201d and instead likes to joke about erecting a statue of Athena in his yard. My husband, who was baptized Episcopalian but didn\u2019t always go to church regularly growing up, said he would identify as Christian. My 10-year-old said she didn\u2019t know what she would say. These responses, especially my dad\u2019s and my husband\u2019s, were surprising to me.",
      "Because this topic is so much more complicated than \u201cAmericans used to be religious and now we\u2019re not,\u201d I\u2019m making this the first newsletter in a series where I\u2019ll explore the contours of our current relationship with religion, and try to unpack how we got here and what\u2019s changed over the past several decades.",
      "My goal: to inject some nuance and specificity into this discussion, since I feel like it can be and sometimes is dominated by partisans who want to argue that the decline in religiosity is either uniformly good or bad for society. My own feeling is one of profound ambivalence. I have no interest in going back to temple and little trust or appetite for organized religion. But I feel passionately about being Jewish, and a little heartsick about not knowing quite how to pass along my ritual and history to my children. I do wonder about what may be lost by not having a community connected by belief, but I\u2019m not quite sure what that is, or if replacing it is possible, or even desirable.",

      "\u201cIn the United States,\u201d the authors tell us, \u201csomewhere between 6,000 and 10,000 churches close down every year, either to be repurposed as apartments, laundries, laser-tag arenas, or skate parks, or to simply be demolished.\u201d (I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that my apartment was once the rectory of a church, also built in the 1800s and transformed, a couple of decades ago, into condos for yuppies who want dramatic windows and a hint of ecclesiastical flavor.)",
      "It\u2019s not just the frequency of churchgoing or temple membership that\u2019s declining in our country: Last month, The Wall Street Journal and NORC at the University of Chicago surveyed around 1,000 American adults about the importance of different values to Americans, including the importance of religion. In 2023, only 39 percent of respondents said religion was very important to them, compared to 62 percent who said that in 1998.",
      "When you look at the full results, the picture becomes a bit more complicated. Sixty percent of respondents said that religion was either somewhat or very important to them, and only 19 percent said religion was not important to them at all. The United States is still a more religiously observant country than our peer nations in Western Europe \u2014 according to Pew Research in 2018, for example, we are more likely to believe in God or some kind of higher power and more likely to pray daily.",
      "But two things can be true at the same time, said Mark Chaves, a professor of sociology at Duke Divinity School who directs the National Congregations Study: America can still be a comparatively observant nation and religious observance can be on the decline in various dimensions, happening at different paces, Chaves explains. \u201cThe decline in religious belief and interest is much slower than the decline in organizational participation,\u201d he said when we spoke.",
      "For example, few Americans say they don\u2019t believe in God at all, and while that minority has grown, it\u2019s still very small. According to NORC data, atheists only made up about 2 percent to 3 percent of the population from 1988 to 2012. By 2021, atheists were 7 percent of the population. In 1988, 17 percent of Americans said they never attended religious services. In 2021, that number was 31 percent.",
      "Religion\u2019s meaning to people goes well beyond regular attendance at a local church, temple or mosque, or trust in religious leaders. That\u2019s why polling questions don\u2019t always capture the whole picture of American religious observance. There\u2019s been a lot of coverage about the rise of what pollsters sometimes call \u201cnones\u201d \u2014 people who say they have no religion in particular, which, according to Gallup, went from 0 percent to 2 percent of the population in the early 1950s to plateauing at around 20 percent of the population from 2017 to 2022.",
      "But it would be incorrect to say that nones don\u2019t retain any trappings of religious observance, like belief in a higher power or performing certain rituals. It doesn\u2019t even mean they never attend church. As Zuckerman, one of the authors of \u201cBeyond Doubt\u201d and a professor at Pitzer College, explained to me over the phone, when social scientists talk about religion, they do it in terms of \u201cthe three B\u2019s: belief, behavior and belonging.\u201d If someone asks you about your religion and you say you don\u2019t have any, Zuckerman said, \u201cthat tells me nothing about your beliefs, and that tells me nothing about your behavior. It just tells me how you identify.\u201d",
      "Since I started reporting this story, I\u2019ve been asking members of my unobservant family what they\u2019d say if a pollster asked them what their religious affiliations are. (Aware of the caveat that both sociologists I talked to noted: Responses are often shaped by how the question is asked.)",
      "None of us have set foot in a temple or church in years. My mother and I both said we would identify as Jewish. My father \u2014 who has two Jewish parents and was bar mitzvahed \u2014 said he\u2019d identify as \u201cnothing\u201d and instead likes to joke about erecting a statue of Athena in his yard. My husband, who was baptized Episcopalian but didn\u2019t always go to church regularly growing up, said he would identify as Christian. My 10-year-old said she didn\u2019t know what she would say. These responses, especially my dad\u2019s and my husband\u2019s, were surprising to me.",
      "Because this topic is so much more complicated than \u201cAmericans used to be religious and now we\u2019re not,\u201d I\u2019m making this the first newsletter in a series where I\u2019ll explore the contours of our current relationship with religion, and try to unpack how we got here and what\u2019s changed over the past several decades.",
      "My goal: to inject some nuance and specificity into this discussion, since I feel like it can be and sometimes is dominated by partisans who want to argue that the decline in religiosity is either uniformly good or bad for society. My own feeling is one of profound ambivalence. I have no interest in going back to temple and little trust or appetite for organized religion. But I feel passionately about being Jewish, and a little heartsick about not knowing quite how to pass along my ritual and history to my children. I do wonder about what may be lost by not having a community connected by belief, but I\u2019m not quite sure what that is, or if replacing it is possible, or even desirable.",

      "The repurposing of former religious buildings in American cities has had a significant impact on the built environment. According to the Wall Street Journal and NORC survey, between 6,000 and 10,000 churches close down each year in the United States, often repurposed or demolished. The transformation of a 19th-century Catholic church in St. Louis into a skateboard park serves as an emblematic example of the decline of organized religious observance in America. While this decline may be seen as a sign of secularization, it also represents a loss of cultural and architectural heritage.",
      "The repurposing of religious buildings often leads to their demolition or significant modifications, resulting in the loss of historic structures. For instance, former churches that have been repurposed as condominiums, restaurants, or offices may lose their original character and historical significance. Additionally, these structures often occupy valuable real estate in urban areas, leading to debates on the best use of the space. In some cases, the repurposing of former religious buildings may contribute to the revitalization of urban neighborhoods, but in other cases, it may lead to the displacement of communities.",
      "Despite the potential drawbacks, the repurposing of former religious buildings also has the potential to breathe new life into urban areas and to create new spaces for social and cultural engagement. For example, the transformation of a former church into a community center or a museum can serve as a catalyst for neighborhood revitalization and can provide opportunities for community engagement and cultural exchange. Furthermore, the reuse of former religious buildings can contribute to sustainable development by preserving existing structures and minimizing the need for new construction.",
      "In conclusion, the repurposing of former religious buildings in American cities has had a multifaceted impact on the built environment. While it represents a loss of cultural and architectural heritage, it also provides opportunities for urban revitalization and creative reuse of historic structures. As such, it is important to consider the broader social and cultural implications of such repurposing in the context of the ongoing process of secularization in American society."

This may increase the likelihood of DeSantis winning the nomination and potentially the presidency.",

      "2. Another consequence of not running could be a missed opportunity for DeSantis to establish himself as a national figure and leader of the conservative movement. By opting out of the race, he could cede the spotlight to other potential candidates and lose valuable exposure that could benefit him in future elections.",
      "3. Finally, if DeSantis does not run in 2024, he may miss the chance to capitalize on the upswing in his political fortunes due to the current uncertainty surrounding the Trump campaign. Given the unpredictability of politics, it is impossible to say when another opportunity like this will arise, and if he does not seize it now, he may regret it in the future."

      "1. Fortune plays a significant role in the decision of a politician to run for president, as political luck can significantly impact the likelihood of success.

This rare political good fortune allowed him to gain momentum and support, raising his chances of becoming the next US president.",
      "2. However, fortune is not the only factor that determines a politician's success. Skill and preparation are also crucial. DeSantis has been strategically building a record of conservative accomplishments in his home state, positioning himself to be a viable candidate for potential future runs. This preparation indicates his political acumen and his willingness to invest in his political future, increasing his likelihood of success in the long run.",
      "3. Overall, the role of fortune in the decision of a politician to run for president is significant but not decisive. While luck can create opportunities and shape political careers, it is ultimately the skill, preparation, and vision of the politician that determine whether they capitalize on these opportunities and succeed. In the case of DeSantis, his combination of political skill and luck has put him in a strong position to run for president in 2024. However, the unpredictable nature of time and chance means that his success is not guaranteed."
