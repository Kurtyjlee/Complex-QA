      "And the guys I served with, we knew it would probably come to an end like this.",

      "Others were fearful for Afghan friends left behind.In interviews, text messages and on Facebook, men and women who collectively spent decades in Afghanistan said they were angry that despite a drawdown that has spanned years, the United States could not manage to exit the country with more dignity.The anguish can be especially raw because veterans often worked side by side with Afghans during the years of attempts at nation-building, and now in that nation\u2019s collapse they see the individual faces of friends who have been enveloped by the anarchy.\u201cMy heart breaks for the Afghan people,\u201d said Ginger Wallace, a retired Air Force colonel who in 2012 oversaw a program that retrained low-level Taliban fighters to clear land mines and work in other jobs that offered an alternative to combat.At the time, she thought that efforts to stabilize Afghanistan were succeeding, and that American troops would one day leave the country a better place.",
      "But her optimism slowly wore down as the Taliban gained ground.\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking, absolutely.",
      "I hate to see it end like this, but you don\u2019t know what else we could have done,\u201d she said in an interview from her home in Louisville, Ky. \u201cDo we have an expectation that U.S. service members should stay and fight the Taliban when the Afghan Army won\u2019t?\u201dMs.",

      "There was no draft or mass mobilization.",
      "Less than 1 percent of the nation served and a disproportionate number of troops came from rural counties in the South and West, far from the seats of power.But veterans have said in interviews over the years that they were cleareyed about the challenges posed by the war, perhaps more so than the rest of the nation.",
      "They saw firsthand the deeply ingrained traditional cultures, tribal allegiances and endemic corruption that continually hobbled American efforts.Mr.",

      "Firstly, the war in Afghanistan was characterized by a more limited and targeted use of military force, as compared to past conflicts such as the Vietnam War or the Gulf War.",
      "This was reflected in the fact that the U.S. relied more heavily on special operations forces, drone strikes, and other forms of covert action rather than a large-scale ground invasion.",
      "Secondly, the war in Afghanistan was also marked by a stronger emphasis on counter-terrorism objectives, as compared to past conflicts.",
      "This was reflected in the fact that the U.S. sought to target and eliminate senior leadership of al-Qaeda and other extremist groups operating in the region, rather than having a broader strategic objective to achieve victory over a specific state or government.",
      "Finally, the war in Afghanistan was characterized by a greater emphasis on nation-building and development, as compared to past conflicts.",

    "question": "2. What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of requiring vaccination for guests at hotels?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "Vaccination requirements for guests at hotels have the potential to offer several benefits, including protecting public health and reducing the spread of infectious diseases.",
      "By mandating vaccination, hotels can create a safer environment for guests and employees, particularly during outbreaks of diseases such as measles and COVID-19.",
      "Additionally, vaccination requirements can help to build trust and credibility among guests, as they perceive the hotel as taking a proactive approach to their health and safety.",
      "On the other hand, implementing vaccination requirements may also have several drawbacks.",
      "For instance, some guests may be hesitant or refuse to comply with the requirements due to concerns about vaccine safety or personal beliefs.",
      "Additionally, vaccination requirements may discourage some guests from visiting the hotel or may lead to decreased bookings.",
      "Moreover, there may be legal implications to consider, as mandating vaccination could potentially violate individuals' privacy and personal choice.",
      "In conclusion, while requiring vaccination for guests at hotels may offer several benefits, such as safeguarding public health and building trust among guests, it also comes with potential drawbacks, such as concerns over personal choice and potential legal issues.",
      "Therefore, it is essential to weigh the benefits and drawbacks carefully before implementing such requirements, and explore alternative measures to protect public health."

    "question": "4. How effective do you think vaccine mandates are in preventing the spread of COVID-19 in the hospitality industry?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "Vaccine mandates have been implemented by many governments as a way to control the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "These mandates require individuals to either receive a COVID-19 vaccine or participate in certain other public health measures, such as wearing masks or staying home from work.",
      "In the hospitality industry, vaccine mandates have been put in place to protect both customers and employees from the spread of the virus.",
      "One argument in favor of vaccine mandates in the hospitality industry is that they can greatly reduce the transmission of COVID-19.",
      "Vaccinated individuals are less likely to contract and spread the virus, leading to a decline in cases within the industry.",
      "This is supported by studies that have shown the high efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing severe disease and hospitalization.",
      "Another argument in support of vaccine mandates is that they can help to reassure customers who may be hesitant to dine or stay in a hotel due to concerns about COVID-19.",
      "By displaying vaccination proof or wearing a mask, hospitality workers can show that they are taking steps to protect their customers, which can increase customer confidence and help to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic.",
      "On the other hand, some critics argue that vaccine mandates are an infringement on individual freedom and could lead to an increase in discrimination against unvaccinated individuals.",
      "Additionally, mandates may be difficult to enforce, particularly for small businesses with limited resources.",
      "There may also be logistical challenges in getting all employees vaccinated in a timely manner."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 With the Aug. 31 deadline for a U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan rapidly approaching, the Pentagon has sharply ramped up the speed of evacuations from the Kabul airport, flying out 21,600 people in 24 hours, Defense Department officials said Tuesday.",
      "But bottlenecks in the system, and President Biden\u2019s insistence that all troops leave the country by the end of the month, may prevent the military from keeping that pace.The race against time means that the 5,800 Marines and soldiers at Hamid Karzai International Airport must try to evacuate thousands more Americans and Afghan allies, and then get themselves out, somehow erasing the detritus of 20 years of war in Afghanistan in the next seven days.That process began on Tuesday, as John F. Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said that several hundred headquarters, maintenance and other support troops who were not essential to the escalating evacuation operation had left the country.Defense officials have been loath to say publicly, though, what seems increasingly clear: Some people will be left behind.Since Aug. 14, when Kabul fell to the Taliban, more than 70,700 people have been evacuated from Afghanistan as of Tuesday evening, Mr. Biden said.That is well below the number of American citizens, foreign nationals and Afghan allies who are trying to get out.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get as many out as we can,\u201d said Mr. Kirby.",
      "He said the American troops at the Kabul airport want to \u201ccontinue this pace as aggressively as we can.\u201dBut for all of Mr. Biden\u2019s insistence on sticking to his withdrawal deadline, neither the Department of Homeland Security nor the State Department has been able to ratchet up the vetting and processing times to the levels needed to meet demand.A U.S. official said it was taking as long as 12 hours for immigration officers at Al Udeid Air Base outside Doha, Qatar, to check arriving Afghans against the National Counterterrorism Center\u2019s watch list.",
      "The official said that vetting and screening processes needed to move faster to prevent the evacuee pipeline from clogging up again at Al Udeid, the largest base receiving Afghans, as it did for several hours last week.The Taliban have warned of \u201cconsequences\u201d if the U.S. military stays beyond the deadline.",
      "And on Tuesday, a Taliban spokesman said the group\u2019s fighters would physically block Afghans from going to the airport.The Pentagon has opened military bases in Virginia, Texas, Wisconsin and New Jersey to provide temporary housing for Afghan refugees, and will probably add more in the coming days, officials said.Mr.",
      "Kirby said Afghan allies of the United States, who fear reprisals from the Taliban, are still being processed at the Kabul airport, although the gates of the airport have been shuttered several times over the past week because of the surge of people.The United States will continue to evacuate Afghans until the last couple of days of its drawdown of troops and equipment, when flights are expected to be filled mostly with military troops and equipment, as well as any Americans desiring to leave.",
      "Dozens of Afghan commandos \u2014 trained by the United States \u2014 are also at the airport and must be evacuated.For the military, part of the problem is the sheer scale of moving so many people so quickly, with so little advanced notice.",
      "For instance, the C-17 military planes, which are transporting 400 people per load, have one or two bathrooms on them, and the flight from Kabul to Qatar is four hours.Once the flights arrive at Al Udeid in Qatar and other intermediate bases in the Middle East and Europe, evacuees are vetted by Homeland Security and State Department officials, who determine if they qualify to enter the United States.The military is treating the Taliban\u2019s red line on Aug. 31 seriously in part because, despite tough talk from Taliban spokesmen, some of the group\u2019s commanders have been cooperating with the U.S. military and allowing many people to get to the airport.",
      "In addition, the American military and the Taliban have cooperated against the threat of attacks from the Islamic State.But after Aug. 31, all bets are off, a senior U.S. official said.With so many people at the Kabul airport, in Doha and at other bases, concerns are rising about sanitation, food and water.",
      "The C-17 planes taking refugees out of Afghanistan are turning around and bringing in extra dumpsters, portable hand-washing stations, refrigerated trucks to keep water cool, and food and water.Over the past four days, Defense Department officials said, three babies were born to evacuees.",
      "One woman went into labor on Saturday during a flight landing at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, Air Force officials said.",
      "The aircraft commander descended to a lower altitude to increase air pressure in the jet, a decision that officials said saved the mother\u2019s life because she had low blood pressure.",
      "When the plane landed, medics rushed aboard and delivered the baby \u2014 a girl \u2014 in the cargo bay.",
      "All three babies are in good condition, Mr. Kirby said Tuesday.After receiving a classified briefing Monday night, Representative Adam B. Schiff, a California Democrat who heads the House Intelligence Committee, said the Aug. 31 deadline for withdrawing U.S. troops from Kabul was unrealistic.\u201cI think it\u2019s possible, but I think it\u2019s very unlikely,\u201d Mr. Schiff told reporters.",
      "Using the abbreviation for special immigrant visas, he added, \u201cGiven the number of Americans who still need to be evacuated, the number of S.I.V.s, the number of others who are members of the Afghan press, civil society leaders, women leaders \u2014 it\u2019s hard for me to imagine all of that can be accomplished between now and the end of the month.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 With the Aug. 31 deadline for a U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan rapidly approaching, the Pentagon has sharply ramped up the speed of evacuations from the Kabul airport, flying out 21,600 people in 24 hours, Defense Department officials said Tuesday.",
      "But bottlenecks in the system, and President Biden\u2019s insistence that all troops leave the country by the end of the month, may prevent the military from keeping that pace.The race against time means that the 5,800 Marines and soldiers at Hamid Karzai International Airport must try to evacuate thousands more Americans and Afghan allies, and then get themselves out, somehow erasing the detritus of 20 years of war in Afghanistan in the next seven days.That process began on Tuesday, as John F. Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said that several hundred headquarters, maintenance and other support troops who were not essential to the escalating evacuation operation had left the country.Defense officials have been loath to say publicly, though, what seems increasingly clear: Some people will be left behind.Since Aug. 14, when Kabul fell to the Taliban, more than 70,700 people have been evacuated from Afghanistan as of Tuesday evening, Mr. Biden said.That is well below the number of American citizens, foreign nationals and Afghan allies who are trying to get out.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get as many out as we can,\u201d said Mr. Kirby.",
      "He said the American troops at the Kabul airport want to \u201ccontinue this pace as aggressively as we can.\u201dBut for all of Mr. Biden\u2019s insistence on sticking to his withdrawal deadline, neither the Department of Homeland Security nor the State Department has been able to ratchet up the vetting and processing times to the levels needed to meet demand.A U.S. official said it was taking as long as 12 hours for immigration officers at Al Udeid Air Base outside Doha, Qatar, to check arriving Afghans against the National Counterterrorism Center\u2019s watch list.",
      "The official said that vetting and screening processes needed to move faster to prevent the evacuee pipeline from clogging up again at Al Udeid, the largest base receiving Afghans, as it did for several hours last week.The Taliban have warned of \u201cconsequences\u201d if the U.S. military stays beyond the deadline.",
      "And on Tuesday, a Taliban spokesman said the group\u2019s fighters would physically block Afghans from going to the airport.The Pentagon has opened military bases in Virginia, Texas, Wisconsin and New Jersey to provide temporary housing for Afghan refugees, and will probably add more in the coming days, officials said.Mr.",
      "Kirby said Afghan allies of the United States, who fear reprisals from the Taliban, are still being processed at the Kabul airport, although the gates of the airport have been shuttered several times over the past week because of the surge of people.The United States will continue to evacuate Afghans until the last couple of days of its drawdown of troops and equipment, when flights are expected to be filled mostly with military troops and equipment, as well as any Americans desiring to leave.",
      "Dozens of Afghan commandos \u2014 trained by the United States \u2014 are also at the airport and must be evacuated.For the military, part of the problem is the sheer scale of moving so many people so quickly, with so little advanced notice.",
      "For instance, the C-17 military planes, which are transporting 400 people per load, have one or two bathrooms on them, and the flight from Kabul to Qatar is four hours.Once the flights arrive at Al Udeid in Qatar and other intermediate bases in the Middle East and Europe, evacuees are vetted by Homeland Security and State Department officials, who determine if they qualify to enter the United States.The military is treating the Taliban\u2019s red line on Aug. 31 seriously in part because, despite tough talk from Taliban spokesmen, some of the group\u2019s commanders have been cooperating with the U.S. military and allowing many people to get to the airport.",
      "In addition, the American military and the Taliban have cooperated against the threat of attacks from the Islamic State.But after Aug. 31, all bets are off, a senior U.S. official said.With so many people at the Kabul airport, in Doha and at other bases, concerns are rising about sanitation, food and water.",
      "The C-17 planes taking refugees out of Afghanistan are turning around and bringing in extra dumpsters, portable hand-washing stations, refrigerated trucks to keep water cool, and food and water.Over the past four days, Defense Department officials said, three babies were born to evacuees.",
      "One woman went into labor on Saturday during a flight landing at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, Air Force officials said.",
      "The aircraft commander descended to a lower altitude to increase air pressure in the jet, a decision that officials said saved the mother\u2019s life because she had low blood pressure.",
      "When the plane landed, medics rushed aboard and delivered the baby \u2014 a girl \u2014 in the cargo bay.",
      "All three babies are in good condition, Mr. Kirby said Tuesday.After receiving a classified briefing Monday night, Representative Adam B. Schiff, a California Democrat who heads the House Intelligence Committee, said the Aug. 31 deadline for withdrawing U.S. troops from Kabul was unrealistic.\u201cI think it\u2019s possible, but I think it\u2019s very unlikely,\u201d Mr. Schiff told reporters.",
      "Using the abbreviation for special immigrant visas, he added, \u201cGiven the number of Americans who still need to be evacuated, the number of S.I.V.s, the number of others who are members of the Afghan press, civil society leaders, women leaders \u2014 it\u2019s hard for me to imagine all of that can be accomplished between now and the end of the month.\u201d"

    "question": "4. How is the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the State Department handling the vetting and processing of arriving Afghans at Al Udeid Air Base?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "Given the complex nature of the situation in Afghanistan, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) along with the State Department are working together to ensure the safe and orderly arrival of Afghan nationals at Al Udeid Air Base.",
      "Their approach involves a multi-faceted vetting process, aimed at identifying and screening individuals for security threats and potential maintenance issues.",
      "Throughout this process, the DHS and State Department are committed to ensuring transparency and accountability in their actions.",
      "One key component of this vetting process is the use of biometric technology, which allows for efficient and accurate identification of individuals.",
      "This technology is crucial in preventing terrorist infiltration and ensuring the safety of the American people.",
      "Additionally, a thorough screening of the documents and backgrounds of each individual is conducted to identify potential risks.",
      "These checks aim to evaluate the individual's history, any criminal records, and their immigration and security status.",
      "Ultimately, this helps to ensure that any individuals who make it onto the base are properly vetted and pose no threats to the United States.",
      "Another aspect of the DHS and State Department's approach is addressing any potential maintenance issues that may arise.",
      "By conducting a thorough assessment of each individual's skills and qualifications, the DHS and State Department are able to identify and assign tasks to individuals based on their abilities.",
      "This helps to minimize any potential strain on base operations and maximize the effectiveness of the mission.",
      "In doing so, the U.S. government is able to strike a balance between maintaining security and ensuring the continued success of operations at Al Udeid Air Base.",
      "In conclusion, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the State Department are working diligently to handle the vetting and processing of arriving Afghans at Al Udeid Air Base.",

      "Mr. Hambali, who is Indonesian, is accused of allying himself with Osama bin Laden\u2019s global jihad, and sending Mr. Bin Amin and Mr. Bin Lep, former architecture students who met in college in Malaysia, to train in Qaeda camps in Afghanistan.Translation and technical issues were evident at the outset.",

      "From a critical perspective, it is essential to recognize that vaccine mandates are just one piece of a larger public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Firstly, vaccine mandates can be effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19 in the hospitality industry, particularly if they are combined with other measures such as mask-wearing, social distancing, and adequate ventilation.",
      "Such a comprehensive approach would help to create a culture of safety in the industry and reduce the risk of transmission of the virus.",
      "Secondly, mandatory vaccination can help to ensure that all staff are protected, regardless of their individual opinions or circumstances.",
      "In the hospitality industry, where staff are often required to work in close proximity to one another, this can be particularly important in preventing the spread of COVID-19.",
      "However, it is also important to consider the potential drawbacks of vaccine mandates.",
      "For example, mandates may create resentment and resistance among employees who feel that their freedom is being violated.",
      "Additionally, mandates may not be effective if they are not adequately enforced or if adequate resources are not provided to support vaccination programs.",
      "In conclusion, while vaccine mandates may contribute to preventing the spread of COVID-19 in the hospitality industry, it is essential to view them as one piece of a broader public health response.",
      "Comprehensive measures that combine vaccine mandates with other preventive measures such as mask-wearing, social distancing, and ventilation, should be implemented in parallel to ensure maximum effectiveness.",

      "As travelers prepare for their next vacation, among the essentials to take along \u2014 like a toothbrush, wallet and phone charger \u2014 could be proof of vaccination for Covid-19, depending on where they are booked to sleep.As coronavirus cases surge again across the country, driven by the highly contagious Delta variant, a small number of hotels in the United States have announced that they will require proof of vaccination from guests and staff.Accommodations such as PUBLIC Hotel, Equinox Hotel and Wythe Hotel, all in New York City, Urban Cowboy Lodge in Big Indian, N.Y., a hamlet in the Catskill Mountains, and Pilgrim House in Provincetown, Mass., are among the first in the United States to announce that they will require evidence of vaccination, via a physical card or a digital verification, from their guests.The precedent for hotels requiring vaccination is already being set beyond the contiguous United States.",
      "In August, Puerto Rico issued an island-wide vaccine mandate that requires guests and staff at all hotels, guesthouses and short-term rentals, including Airbnb, to provide proof of vaccination or a negative PCR or antigen test taken within 72 hours before their visit.",
      "If a person is staying longer than a week, they will need to present negative tests to hotel staff on a weekly basis.Elite Island Resorts, a Florida-based company that runs a collection of all-inclusive Caribbean resorts stretching from Antigua to Panama, announced that all guests over the age of 12 would be required to show proof of Covid-19 vaccination upon arrival beginning on Sept. 1.\u201cIt\u2019s imperative for us to protect the hospitals of these smaller island nations, and while they have had a good track record so far with Covid-19, we must remain vigilant, and all do our part to become part of the solution,\u201d wrote Robert A. Barrett, the founder and chief executive of Elite Island Resorts, in the company\u2019s announcement.Although European destinations are rolling out various vaccine mandates, hotels are mostly not requiring proof of immunization.",
      "In Portugal, however, hotel guests need to show proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test.In the United States, PUBLIC Hotel, a boutique accommodation on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side owned by the hotel magnate Ian Schrager, earlier this month became one of the country\u2019s first hotels to mandate proof of vaccination from its guests and staff.",
      "The requirement will begin on Sept. 5, with only medical and religious exemptions.\u201cWe need to beat Covid-19 together,\u201d Mr. Schrager said in a news release that announced his decision.",
      "\u201cAfter all, looking after people is our business.",
      "We just didn\u2019t see how to fulfill this responsibility without taking action.\u201dAt Equinox Hotel New York, the first hotel by the luxury fitness company, guests will be required to show proof of first vaccination from Sept. 13.",
      "Equinox is also requiring on-site staff to be vaccinated.\u201cEquinox Hotels has always and will continue to listen to infectious disease experts as well as local governments to guide our decision making,\u201d said Chris Norton, the chief executive of Equinox Hotels, in an email.The American Hotel and Lodging Association, an industry trade group, issued safety guidelines based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which includes encouraging employees to get vaccinated.\u201cA.H.L.A.",
      "urges everyone who is eligible to be vaccinated as soon as possible, including industry employees,\u201d said Chip Rogers, president and chief executive of the association.While industry leaders may be encouraging vaccination, some hospitality experts aren\u2019t convinced that there will be a widespread movement of hotels requiring vaccination.\u201cAt the current stage, I don\u2019t think we will see broad vaccine requirements by hotels,\u201d said Christopher K. Anderson, a professor at the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration.\u201cAt present not even all major hotel brands are requiring their employees to be vaccinated \u2014 let alone guests,\u201d Mr. Anderson said in an email.",
      "He added that boutique hotels are likely to find controlling vaccine mandates easier than the larger chains.As of late August, the larger U.S. hotel chains, including Marriott International, Hyatt and Hilton, are not requiring guests to be vaccinated.While guests at Marriott hotels are not required to be vaccinated, proof of vaccine verification may be required by local jurisdictions, according to Sarah Brown, a spokeswoman of Marriott International.",
      "And the company is offering incentives for its employees to get vaccinated.\u201cIn March, Marriott announced the creation of the Vaccination Care Program, which provides a financial award to U.S. and Canadian associates at its managed properties who get vaccinated for Covid-19, the flexibility for vaccination appointments and education on the benefits of vaccination,\u201d Ms. Brown said in an email.",
      "\u201cEmployees receive the equivalent of four hours of pay upon completion of the vaccination.\u201dAfter being closed for more than a year, PUBLIC reopened in early June and has seen a significant boom in business, Mr. Schrager said.Recognizing the risk to business by mandating vaccines, he said the decision was about his responsibility to protect his staff and guests, as well as the future reputation of his hotel.\u201cThere are some people that are not going to be happy with it,\u201d Mr. Schrager said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not looking to force them to do anything they don\u2019t want to do.",

      "Overweight adults should be screened for Type 2 diabetes and abnormally high blood sugar levels starting at age 35, five years earlier than currently advised, an expert task force recommended on Tuesday.The new recommendation, which does not apply to pregnant women, comes amid cresting rates of obesity and diabetes in the United States.",
      "It means that more than 40 percent of the adult population should now be screened, according to one estimate.The guideline was issued by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which makes recommendations for preventive services and screenings that insurance companies must completely cover, without out of pocket costs to the insured, under the Affordable Care Act.The task force\u2019s recommendation and a summary of the latest scientific evidence were published on Tuesday in the journal JAMA.Nearly one in seven American adults now has diabetes, the highest rate on record, a recent study found.",
      "There has been little improvement over the past decade in patients\u2019 ability to manage the condition, keeping in check their blood sugar levels, blood pressure and cholesterol.The increase is especially troubling amid the pandemic, as diabetes is one of the chronic medical conditions that increase the risk that a coronavirus infection will lead to severe illness, hospitalization or even death.Diabetes is linked to heart disease and liver disease, and it is the leading cause of kidney failure and new blindness in adults.",
      "The condition can lead to limb amputation, nerve damage and other complications.The task force said health care providers should consider screening some individuals even earlier than age 35 if they are at heightened risk.",
      "Those include people with a family history of diabetes or a personal history of conditions like gestational diabetes, and people who are Black, Hispanic, Native American, Alaska Native or Asian American.All of these groups have higher rates of diabetes than white Americans.\u201cThe Covid epidemic is really important, but we also have an epidemic of diabetes and pre-diabetes driven by the epidemic of obesity and lack of exercise,\u201d said Dr. Michael J. Barry, the vice chair of the task force who directs the informed medical decisions program at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.",
      "\u201cAll these conditions that we\u2019ve lived with for years are still out there.\u201dAbout one-third of U.S. adults have high blood sugar levels, a condition called pre-diabetes that often precedes Type 2 diabetes and can progress to full blown disease.",
      "Most are unaware they have the condition, which doesn\u2019t produce obvious symptoms and is why screening is essential, Dr. Barry said.Being overweight or obese is the most important risk factor for the most common type of diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, and for pre-diabetes.",
      "Lifestyle changes \u2014 including increasing physical activity, eating a healthier diet and losing even a modest amount of weight \u2014 can prevent the progression from pre-diabetes to full diabetes.",
      "(Drug treatment is also an option.",
      ")Screening generally involves a blood test to determine whether blood sugar (or glucose) is elevated.",
      "The task force called for lowering the age of first screening to 35 because that is when the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes starts to inch upward.",
      "Screening should be carried out every three years until age 70, the task force said.Dr.",
      "Tannaz Moin, an endocrinologist who co-wrote an editorial accompanying the new recommendations, said that lowering the age for screening was a step in the right direction, and that she was pleased that the guidelines emphasized the importance of detecting pre-diabetes.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more recognition that pre-diabetes is a big problem that often flies under the radar,\u201d she said.",
      "It is critical to detect pre-diabetes in younger adults, because they may live with diabetes for a long time if they develop it at a relatively young age, and will be at a greater risk of developing complications.Intensive lifestyle interventions that focus on moderate weight loss and include 150 minutes of physical activity per week can prevent or delay the onset of Type 2 diabetes in overweight or obese people with pre-diabetes.",
      "A drug, metformin, is also an option but is not as beneficial as lifestyle changes.\u201cWe have really good evidence that we can delay the onset of Type 2 diabetes if we get individuals who have pre-diabetes to do something about their risk,\u201d Dr. Moin said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the same for people with Type 2 diabetes: Once we know they have it, we have a whole toolbox of things we can offer them.\u201dRates of diabetes and pre-diabetes have increased in recent years among younger populations, including children and teenagers.",
      "Studies have shown that almost one in four adults ages 18 to 44 has pre-diabetes.Another study published on Tuesday in JAMA reported that the prevalence of both Type 1 diabetes, often called juvenile diabetes, and Type 2 diabetes, which generally starts later in life, increased in children and teenagers from 2001 to 2017, with the greatest increases among those ages 16 and over.The rate of Type 2 diabetes nearly doubled, to 0.67 per 1,000 Americans ages 10 to 19 in 2017 from 0.34 per 1,000 young people in 2001.",

      "It means that more than 40 percent of the adult population should now be screened, according to one estimate.The guideline was issued by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which makes recommendations for preventive services and screenings that insurance companies must completely cover, without out of pocket costs to the insured, under the Affordable Care Act.The task force\u2019s recommendation and a summary of the latest scientific evidence were published on Tuesday in the journal JAMA.Nearly one in seven American adults now has diabetes, the highest rate on record, a recent study found.",
      "There has been little improvement over the past decade in patients\u2019 ability to manage the condition, keeping in check their blood sugar levels, blood pressure and cholesterol.The increase is especially troubling amid the pandemic, as diabetes is one of the chronic medical conditions that increase the risk that a coronavirus infection will lead to severe illness, hospitalization or even death.Diabetes is linked to heart disease and liver disease, and it is the leading cause of kidney failure and new blindness in adults.",
      "The condition can lead to limb amputation, nerve damage and other complications.The task force said health care providers should consider screening some individuals even earlier than age 35 if they are at heightened risk.",

Barry, the vice chair of the task force who directs the informed medical decisions program at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.",
      "\u201cAll these conditions that we\u2019ve lived with for years are still out there.\u201dAbout one-third of U.S. adults have high blood sugar levels, a condition called pre-diabetes that often precedes Type 2 diabetes and can progress to full blown disease.",
      "Most are unaware they have the condition, which doesn\u2019t produce obvious symptoms and is why screening is essential, Dr. Barry said.Being overweight or obese is the most important risk factor for the most common type of diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, and for pre-diabetes.",
      "Lifestyle changes \u2014 including increasing physical activity, eating a healthier diet and losing even a modest amount of weight \u2014 can prevent the progression from pre-diabetes to full diabetes.",

      "Screening should be carried out every three years until age 70, the task force said.Dr.",
      "Tannaz Moin, an endocrinologist who co-wrote an editorial accompanying the new recommendations, said that lowering the age for screening was a step in the right direction, and that she was pleased that the guidelines emphasized the importance of detecting pre-diabetes.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more recognition that pre-diabetes is a big problem that often flies under the radar,\u201d she said.",
      "It is critical to detect pre-diabetes in younger adults, because they may live with diabetes for a long time if they develop it at a relatively young age, and will be at a greater risk of developing complications.Intensive lifestyle interventions that focus on moderate weight loss and include 150 minutes of physical activity per week can prevent or delay the onset of Type 2 diabetes in overweight or obese people with pre-diabetes.",
      "A drug, metformin, is also an option but is not as beneficial as lifestyle changes.\u201cWe have really good evidence that we can delay the onset of Type 2 diabetes if we get individuals who have pre-diabetes to do something about their risk,\u201d Dr. Moin said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the same for people with Type 2 diabetes: Once we know they have it, we have a whole toolbox of things we can offer them.\u201dRates of diabetes and pre-diabetes have increased in recent years among younger populations, including children and teenagers.",
      "Studies have shown that almost one in four adults ages 18 to 44 has pre-diabetes.Another study published on Tuesday in JAMA reported that the prevalence of both Type 1 diabetes, often called juvenile diabetes, and Type 2 diabetes, which generally starts later in life, increased in children and teenagers from 2001 to 2017, with the greatest increases among those ages 16 and over.The rate of Type 2 diabetes nearly doubled, to 0.67 per 1,000 Americans ages 10 to 19 in 2017 from 0.34 per 1,000 young people in 2001.",

      "Having an ample supply of clean water is a top priority during extreme weather like Hurricane Ida, which can disrupt normal water systems in several ways.\u201cYou don\u2019t know what is necessarily going to happen due to the storm\u2019s impact,\u201d said Stefanie Arcangelo, an American Red Cross spokeswoman.",
      "\u201cThe storm could impact the public water system.\u201dOften during or immediately after a storm, a boil-water advisory will be issued, meaning there may be contaminants in the water that could make it unsafe to drink, she said.That\u2019s why the American Red Cross and the Federal Emergency Management Agency recommend that people store a gallon of water per person per day, just in case a storm damages the local water system or knocks out electricity, making pumps inoperable and keeping people with electric stoves from being able to boil water readily.The average person drinks about a half-gallon of water a day, and needs additional water for food preparation and hygiene, FEMA noted.\u201cTo prepare the safest and most reliable emergency supply of water, it is recommended that you purchase commercially bottled water,\u201d FEMA said.",
      "\u201cKeep bottled water in its original container, and do not open it until you need to use it.\u201dIf people don\u2019t want to buy water that way, they can put regular tap water in clean, tightly sealed containers or bottles, FEMA said.If water supplies run low, drink the amount needed that day and then try to find more the next day, the agency advises, adding that reducing activity and staying cool can minimize the amount of water the body needs."

      "For many individuals, purchasing commercially bottled water is the primary method for storing emergency water supplies.",
      "However, there are alternative methods that can be more cost-effective and sustainable.",
      "One option is to obtain large water storage containers and fill them with tap water.",
      "This allows for the storage of a significant amount of water while also reducing the environmental impact of disposable plastic bottles.",
      "It is important to note that the water should be properly treated and filtered to ensure purity and safety.",
      "Another method is to collect rainwater and store it in covered containers.",
      "This can be done by installing gutters and downspouts on the roof and directing the water into a large container.",
      "This method is particularly effective during periods of heavy rainfall, but care should be taken to ensure that the water is free from contaminants.",
      "Finally, emergency water storage can also be achieved through the use of water purification tablets and portable water filters.",
      "These devices can be used to treat water from natural sources, such as rivers and lakes, and provide a means of obtaining clean drinking water in the event of an emergency.",
      "Overall, while purchasing commercially bottled water is a convenient option, there are several alternative methods for storing emergency water supplies that are more sustainable and can be more cost-effective in the long run.",
      "It is important to consider the pros and cons of each method and choose the one that best suits individual needs and circumstances."

Boasberg of the District Court of the District of Columbia, showed the steep challenges regulators face.",
      "Although the companies dominate the markets they are in \u2014 social media, in the case of Facebook \u2014 the courts often look at whether prices are rising as an indication of monopolization.",

      "Corruption has led to a lack of trust in the government and has fueled support for the insurgency.",

      "One benefit of the special immigrant visa programs for Afghan interpreters is that they provide a direct route to safety and security for those who have put themselves in harm's way by working with American forces.",
      "These individuals have often faced violence and persecution from extremist groups in Afghanistan, and the threat to their lives and well-being remains high.",
      "By providing a pathway for them to immigrate to the United States, the special immigrant visa programs offer a chance for these individuals and their families to start a new life in a country with greater protections and opportunities.",
      "Another benefit of the special immigrant visa programs is that they help to foster greater cooperation and collaboration between the United States and Afghanistan.",
      "By demonstrating a commitment to the well-being and safety of Afghan interpreters and their families, the United States sends a strong message of support and partnership to the Afghan people.",
      "This can help to build trust and strengthen relationships between the two countries, which can have important implications for ongoing efforts to stabilize and rebuild Afghanistan.",

      "One limitation is that the programs have been slow and bureaucratic, leading to lengthy wait times and frustration for many applicants.",
      "Additionally, the programs are limited in scope and may not be able to accommodate all of the individuals who have worked with American forces in Afghanistan.",
      "Finally, there are concerns about the long-term sustainability of these programs and the extent to which they may be subject to changes in U.S. immigration policies.",

      "BRUSSELS \u2014 Back in June, the European Union urged its member countries to reopen their borders to travelers from the United States, hoping to give a boost to the continent\u2019s ailing tourism sector in the crucial summer season.It worked.",
      "American tourists flocked to the beaches of Spain and Greece, the countryside of Italy and the streets of Amsterdam and Paris.But on Monday, the European Union proposed new travel restrictions for unvaccinated visitors from the United States, a response to the alarming surge in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations across the Atlantic.In removing the United States from a \u201csafe list\u201d of countries whose residents can travel without requirements such as quarantine and testing, the European Council of the European Union, which represents governments of the bloc\u2019s 27 countries, signaled that potential restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus may remain in place for months.",
      "The new measures could deal a fresh blow to Europe\u2019s ailing tourism sector.Other countries removed from the \u201csafe list\u201d include Israel, Kosovo, Lebanon, Montenegro and North Macedonia, most which have reported a surge of cases in the past 14 days, according to a New York Times tracker.The suggested restrictions are not mandatory, and it remains up to each European Union member state to follow the guidelines.",
      "So it was not immediately clear which countries, if any, would reintroduce restrictions or when they might begin.If enforced, the new restrictions would apply to unvaccinated travelers only.",
      "The European Council already recommends that all visitors who have been inoculated with an E.U.-approved vaccine be allowed to travel.",
      "That includes the three vaccines available in the United States and manufactured by Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and Moderna, as well as AstraZeneca.Some countries have also implemented more stringent measures than others, even for visitors from a country on the safe list, yet once visitors have entered an E.U.",
      "country, they can move across the bloc freely.Under the current guidelines, unvaccinated travelers from countries on the European Council\u2019s safe list can visit E.U.",
      "countries without quarantining by showing a negative test.",
      "But a minority of countries have also kept self-isolation requirements in place, including, in some cases, for vaccinated visitors.Meanwhile, United States has remained closed to Europeans, who have expressed frustration at the lack of reciprocity.With more than 52 percent of Americans fully vaccinated, most were able to travel to Europe without hurdles this summer and can continue to do so.",
      "Yet the decision to remove the United States from the safe list could still create confusion among American tourists, said Marie Audren, the director of HOTREC, a lobbying group that represents the hospitality industry in Europe.\u201cEvery client at a hotel, a restaurant, a bar or a cafe was valuable to the tourism industry this summer,\u201d Ms. Audren said.",

      "Many refugees are unfamiliar with the American legal system and struggle to understand the process for applying for asylum or other forms of protection.",

      "Another challenge that refugees face is finding adequate housing and employment opportunities.",
      "Refugees often arrive in the United States with limited resources and must quickly find a place to live and a way to support themselves and their families.",
      "This can be especially difficult in certain parts of the country where housing costs are high and job opportunities are limited.",
      "Finally, refugees often face social and cultural barriers upon arrival in the United States.",
      "This can include language barriers, cultural differences, and discrimination or xenophobia from members of the local community.",
      "These barriers can make it difficult for refugees to integrate into American society and find a sense of belonging and community."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Biden administration, under pressure from families of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks, said on Monday that it intended to disclose some long-classified documents that the families think could detail connections between the government of Saudi Arabia and the hijackers who carried out the attacks.In a court filing in long-running litigation brought by the victims\u2019 families against Saudi Arabia, the Justice Department said that the F.B.I.",
      "\u201crecently\u201d closed a portion of its investigation into the terrorist attacks and was beginning a review of documents that it had previously said must remain secret with an eye toward disclosing more of them.\u201cThe F.B.I.",
      "has decided to review its prior privilege assertions to identify additional information appropriate for disclosure,\u201d the department said in a letter to two federal judges in Manhattan overseeing the case.",
      "\u201cThe F.B.I.",
      "will disclose such information on a rolling basis as expeditiously as possible.\u201dThe terse letter provided no further details about what additional information might become public, or when disclosures would begin.The decision came after a group representing more than 1,600 people directly affected by the attacks called last week for President Biden to not participate in any memorial events for the 20th anniversary of the attacks next month unless he fulfilled a campaign promise to review the documents for possible declassification and release.After the filing, the White House issued a statement from Mr. Biden expressing sympathy for the family members and invoking a 2009 policy, issued when he was vice president, that imposed limits on when the government may assert the state secrets privilege to block the disclosure of evidence in lawsuits for national security reasons.\u201cAs I promised during my campaign, my administration is committed to ensuring the maximum degree of transparency under the law, and to adhering to the rigorous guidance issued during the Obama-Biden administration on the invocation of the state secrets privilege,\u201d Mr. Biden said.He added, \u201cIn this vein, I welcome the Department of Justice\u2019s filing today, which commits to conducting a fresh review of documents where the government has previously asserted privileges, and to doing so as quickly as possible.\u201dIn a letter sent to a representative of the families before the presidential election last fall, Mr. Biden had said he would direct his attorney general to \u201cexamine the merits of all cases where the invocation of privilege is recommended, and to err on the side of disclosure in cases where, as here, the events in question occurred two decades or longer ago.\u201dMr.",

      "The organizers of the statement last week calling for Mr. Biden to release the documents said they were unsure how many victims were represented by its more than 1,600 signatures.",

      "They have pushed four American presidents, with little success, to release more information about Saudi involvement in financing the attacks.The 9/11 Commission found \u201cno evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded\u201d Al Qaeda, which carried out the attacks.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Biden administration, under pressure from families of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks, said on Monday that it intended to disclose some long-classified documents that the families think could detail connections between the government of Saudi Arabia and the hijackers who carried out the attacks.In a court filing in long-running litigation brought by the victims\u2019 families against Saudi Arabia, the Justice Department said that the F.B.I.",
      "\u201crecently\u201d closed a portion of its investigation into the terrorist attacks and was beginning a review of documents that it had previously said must remain secret with an eye toward disclosing more of them.\u201cThe F.B.I.",
      "has decided to review its prior privilege assertions to identify additional information appropriate for disclosure,\u201d the department said in a letter to two federal judges in Manhattan overseeing the case.",
      "\u201cThe F.B.I.",
      "will disclose such information on a rolling basis as expeditiously as possible.\u201dThe terse letter provided no further details about what additional information might become public, or when disclosures would begin.The decision came after a group representing more than 1,600 people directly affected by the attacks called last week for President Biden to not participate in any memorial events for the 20th anniversary of the attacks next month unless he fulfilled a campaign promise to review the documents for possible declassification and release.After the filing, the White House issued a statement from Mr. Biden expressing sympathy for the family members and invoking a 2009 policy, issued when he was vice president, that imposed limits on when the government may assert the state secrets privilege to block the disclosure of evidence in lawsuits for national security reasons.\u201cAs I promised during my campaign, my administration is committed to ensuring the maximum degree of transparency under the law, and to adhering to the rigorous guidance issued during the Obama-Biden administration on the invocation of the state secrets privilege,\u201d Mr. Biden said.He added, \u201cIn this vein, I welcome the Department of Justice\u2019s filing today, which commits to conducting a fresh review of documents where the government has previously asserted privileges, and to doing so as quickly as possible.\u201dIn a letter sent to a representative of the families before the presidential election last fall, Mr. Biden had said he would direct his attorney general to \u201cexamine the merits of all cases where the invocation of privilege is recommended, and to err on the side of disclosure in cases where, as here, the events in question occurred two decades or longer ago.\u201dMr.",
      "Biden had referred to a Trump-era decision that kept the documents classified on the grounds that they contained state secrets, and said his own administration would \u201cwork constructively on such cases.\u201dNearly 3,000 people died in the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.",
      "The organizers of the statement last week calling for Mr. Biden to release the documents said they were unsure how many victims were represented by its more than 1,600 signatures.",
      "Each name belongs to either a close relative of someone whose death was caused by the attacks, a person who became severely sick as a result of them or a survivor, they said.The Biden administration\u2019s decision to review the classified documents was the latest development in a nearly two-decade odyssey for some of the families.",
      "They have pushed four American presidents, with little success, to release more information about Saudi involvement in financing the attacks.The 9/11 Commission found \u201cno evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded\u201d Al Qaeda, which carried out the attacks.",
      "But the commission\u2019s phrasing left some to speculate that there might be evidence of involvement by other, lower-ranking officials.An investigation last year by The New York Times Magazine and ProPublica found that F.B.I.",
      "agents, who secretly investigated Saudi connections to the Sept. 11 attacks for more than a decade, had discovered circumstantial evidence of such support but no smoking gun.The families were stunned in 2019 when William P. Barr, who was the attorney general under President Donald J. Trump at the time, declared in a statement to a federal court that documents relating to the attacks should stay classified to protect national security.On Friday, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said that White House officials had met in recent weeks with groups representing families of victims, and that the document requests would \u201ccontinue to be a priority\u201d for Mr. Biden.In the statement last week, the families group said that it could not \u201cin good faith, and with veneration to those lost, sick and injured,\u201d welcome Mr. Biden to the commemorations next month if he did not follow through on his campaign promise.\u201cIt\u2019s 20 years; this has gone on for too long,\u201d Brett Eagleson, who was a 15-year-old sophomore in high school when his father, Bruce, died at the World Trade Center, said in an interview last week.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to release the documents and you\u2019re going to continue with the process of covering up the Saudi role in 9/11, we\u2019ll have to object to you coming.\u201dMr.",
      "Eagleson, who is now 35 and works in banking, said that seeing the documents might offer him and other victims\u2019 relatives some long-overdue closure.He said on Monday that the F.B.I.\u2019s review was a step in the right direction, but that it was not sufficient to assuage families\u2019 anxieties about the documents.\u201cIt sounds like it\u2019s promising, but let\u2019s see what they actually produce,\u201d he said.Another group of victims\u2019 families and survivors, 9/11 Community United, criticized the Biden administration\u2019s move, calling it a \u201chalfhearted, insufficient commitment to transparency\u201d in a statement and saying that it applied only to limited documents.\u201cThis announcement is a necessary but insufficient step towards transparency, accountability and above all, justice,\u201d a member of the group, Terry Strada, whose husband died in the attacks, said in a statement.Mr.",
      "Eagleson is among the thousands of victims\u2019 relatives who accused Saudi Arabia in a 2017 lawsuit of complicity in the attacks.",
      "They had successfully fought for years for the right to sue, gaining it in 2016 when Congress overrode a veto by President Barack Obama to pass into law a bill allowing such a lawsuit.The suit has languished in the courts as lawyers for the kingdom fought it.",
      "On Friday, James P. Kreindler, one of the lawyers representing the families, said that 20 Saudi officials were recently questioned under oath, and added that a judge would decide next year whether the case advances."

      "The accuracy of the translation can be instrumental in ensuring a fair trial, and any errors in the translation could negatively impact the accused's case.",
      "Another technical issue that occurred during the formal charging of the three men was the collection and preservation of evidence.",
      "In the case, there were concerns about the chain of custody of the evidence collected from the crime scene and the individuals involved.",

      "He told reporters before the hearing that Mr. Hambali had been \u201cbrutalized\u201d and spent at least half of his detention in solitary confinement.",
      "He said the prisoner was owed \u201can apology\u201d and repatriation, \u201cnot to be held in a cage in a Caribbean island.\u201dHearings at Guant\u00e1namo have been mostly held between English and Arabic, but have also suffered translation problems.",
