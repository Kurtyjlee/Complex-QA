      "If you had told me several months ago, immediately after Elon Musk bought Twitter and Ron DeSantis celebrated a thumping re-election victory, that DeSantis would launch his presidential campaign in conversation with Musk, I would have thought, intriguing: The rightward-trending billionaire whose rockets and cars stand out in an economy dominated by apps and financial instruments meets the Republican politician whose real-world victories contrast with the virtual populism of Donald Trump.",
      "The actual launch of DeSantis\u2019s presidential campaign, in a \u201cTwitter Spaces\u201d event that crashed repeatedly and played to a smaller audience than he would have claimed just by showing up on Fox, instead offered the political version of the lesson that we\u2019ve been taught repeatedly by Musk\u2019s stewardship of Twitter: The internet can be a trap.",
      "For the Tesla and SpaceX mogul, the trap was sprung because Musk wanted to attack the groupthink of liberal institutions, and seeing that groupthink manifest on his favorite social media site, he imagined that owning Twitter was the key to transforming public discourse.",
      "But for all its influence, social media is still downstream of other institutions \u2014 universities, newspapers, television channels, movie studios, other internet platforms. Twitter is real life, but only through its relationship to other realities; it doesn\u2019t have the capacity to be a hub of discourse, news gathering or entertainment on its own. And many of Musk\u2019s difficulties as the Twitter C.E.O. have reflected a simple overestimation of social media\u2019s inherent authority and influence.",
      "Thus he\u2019s tried to sell the privilege of verification, the famous \u201cblue checks,\u201d without recognizing that they were valued because of their connection to real-world institutions and lose value if they reflect a Twitter hierarchy alone. Or he\u2019s encouraged his favored journalists to publish their scoops and essays on his site when it isn\u2019t yet built out for that kind of publication. Or he\u2019s encouraged media figures like Tucker Carlson and now politicians like DeSantis to run shows or do interviews on his platform, without having the infrastructure in place to make all that work.",
      "It\u2019s entirely possible that Musk can build out that infrastructure eventually, and make Twitter more capacious than it is today. But there isn\u2019t some immediate social-media shortcut to the influence he\u2019s seeking. If you want Twitter to be the world\u2019s news hub, you probably need a Twitter newsroom. If you want Twitter to host presidential candidates, you probably need a Twitter channel that feels like a professional newscast. And while you\u2019re trying to build those things, you need to be careful that the nature of social media doesn\u2019t diminish you to the kind of caricatured role \u2014 troll instead of tycoon \u2014 that tempts everyone on Twitter.",
      "That kind of diminishment is what the Twitter event handed to DeSantis, whose choppy launch may be forgotten but who would be wise to learn from what went wrong. There\u2019s an emerging criticism of the Florida governor that suggests that his whole persona is too online \u2014 that his talk about wokeness, wokeness, wokeness is pitched to a narrow and internet-based faction within the G.O.P., that he\u2019s setting himself to be like Elizabeth Warren in 2020, whose promise of plans, plans, plans thrilled the wonk faction but fell flat with normal Democratic voters.",
      "I think this critique is overdrawn. If you look at polling of Republican primary voters, the culture war appears to be a general concern rather than an elite fixation, and there\u2019s a plausible argument that the conflict with the new progressivism is the main thing binding the G.O.P. coalition together.",
      "But it does seem true that the conflict with progressivism in the context of social media is a more boutique taste, and that lots of anti-woke conservatives aren\u2019t particularly invested in whether the previous Twitter regime was throttling such-and-such right-wing influencer or taking orders from such-and-such \u201cdisinformation\u201d specialist. And it\u2019s also true that DeSantis is running against a candidate who, at any moment, can return to Twitter and bestride its feeds like a colossus, no matter whatever Republican alternative the \u201cchief twit\u201d might prefer.",
      "So introducing himself in that online space made DeSantis look unnecessarily small \u2014 smaller than Musk\u2019s presence and Trump\u2019s absence, shrunk down to the scale of debates about shadow banning and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The Florida governor\u2019s best self-advertisement in a primary should be his promise to be more active in reality than Trump, with his claim to be better at actual governance made manifest through his advantage in flesh-pressing, campaign-trail-hitting energy.",
      "The good news for DeSantis is that he doesn\u2019t have billions invested in a social media company, so having endured a diminishing introduction, he can slip the trap and walk away \u2014 toward the crowds, klieg lights and the grass.",

      "Firstly, social media platforms are designed to keep users engaged and on the platform for as long as possible, which can make it difficult for users to focus on the task at hand, which is to influence public discourse.",
      "Secondly, the algorithms used by social media platforms prioritize content that is most likely to generate engagement, such as likes, comments, and shares, which can result in users only seeing content that confirms their existing beliefs and opinions, rather than exposing them to diverse perspectives.",
      "Finally, the echo chambers that are created by social media algorithms can make it difficult for users to encounter and engage with opposing viewpoints, which can make it difficult for them to influence public discourse in a meaningful way.",
      "Overall, the article suggests that social media can be a powerful tool for influencing public discourse, but it requires users to be mindful of the potential traps and take steps to overcome them.."

And it\u2019s also true that DeSantis is running against a candidate who, at any moment, can return to Twitter and bestride its feeds like a colossus, no matter whatever Republican alternative the \u201cchief twit\u201d might prefer.",
      "So introducing himself in that online space made DeSantis look unnecessarily small \u2014 smaller than Musk\u2019s presence and Trump\u2019s absence, shrunk down to the scale of debates about shadow banning and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The Florida governor\u2019s best self-advertisement in a primary should be his promise to be more active in reality than Trump, with his claim to be better at actual governance made manifest through his advantage in flesh-pressing, campaign-trail-hitting energy.",
      "The good news for DeSantis is that he doesn\u2019t have billions invested in a social media company, so having endured a diminishing introduction, he can slip the trap and walk away \u2014 toward the crowds, klieg lights and the grass.",
      "For Musk, though, escape requires either the admission of defeat in this particular arena or else a long campaign of innovation that eventually makes Twitter as big as he wrongly imagined it to be."

    "answer": [
      "In his campaign launch on Twitter, DeSantis faced several challenges, including low name recognition and skepticism from the public about his political experience. To overcome these challenges, the author suggests that DeSantis can take several steps, such modesty, being himself, and taking the time to build relationships with Floridians.",
      "Firstly, the author suggests that DeSantis should practice modesty and avoid being arrogant or condescending towards his opponents. By doing so, he can win over skeptical voters and build a positive reputation.",
      "Secondly, the author suggests that DeSantis should be himself and avoid trying to be someone he is not. This means that he should not try to imitate his opponents or adopt a political persona that is not authentic to him. By being true to himself, he can build a genuine connection with voters and establish his authenticity.",
      "Finally, the author suggests that DeSantis should take the time to build relationships with Floridians. This means that he should engage with the public and listen to their concerns, rather than simply trying to sell his message. By building trust and establishing relationships with voters, he can overcome the challenges he faced during his campaign launch and win their support."

      "Every year the Federal Reserve takes a financial snapshot of America. It tells us how people are making ends meet, or not. Whether they\u2019re (still) living with their parents, if they\u2019ve saved money for retirement, whether they wish they had chosen a different major in college and so on.",
      "Last year\u2019s Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking, as the Fed calls it, covered 11,667 U.S. adults and was conducted online from Oct. 21 through Nov. 1. There are breakdowns by age, income, race and gender. Considering that there are no anecdotes and the writing is reserved, the Fed\u2019s report on the survey, \u201cEconomic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2022,\u201d is a surprisingly human document.",
      "The report, which was released on Monday, portrays a nation that is enjoying a strong job market but is unhappy about inflation. Most people feel at least OK about their personal situations but are down on the national economic situation. If I were sitting in the Oval Office right now, I would be concerned about the public\u2019s fairly gloomy answers.",
      "I\u2019ll start with the chart that has the most political valence. It shows that the share of people who say they\u2019re doing \u201cat least OK\u201d financially has been remarkably stable since 2017, at around three-quarters. The pandemic recession isn\u2019t visible in the numbers. In contrast to that self-assessment, the share who say the national economy is good or excellent has fallen sharply, to just 18 percent last year from 41 percent in 2017.",
      "True, some people may perceive \u201cgood or excellent\u201d to be a tougher standard than \u201cat least OK,\u201d so you might expect the numbers on the national economy to be lower. What\u2019s surprising (and bad for incumbent politicians) is that the gap in perceptions between the personal and the national has widened so much, to 55 percentage points last year from 25 percentage points in 2019.",
      "People are comparison machines \u2014 we compare ourselves with others and with ourselves at different times \u2014 so maybe one reason for the gloomy appraisal of the national situation is that people feel things have been going in the wrong direction lately. When asked about their financial situations compared with 12 months earlier, the percentage who said \u201cworse off\u201d zoomed last year to 35 percent from just 13 percent as recently as 2018.",
      "The Fed report is consistent with other recent surveys showing a pessimism that\u2019s somewhat surprising, given the recent reduction in the (still high) inflation rate, as well as the continued strength of the job market. (The unemployment rate in April, 3.4 percent, tied for the lowest since 1969.) My Opinion colleague Paul Krugman speculated recently that negative media coverage, pessimism from economists and partisanship helped explain the divergence.",
      "Yet inflation, albeit down from its peak, can\u2019t be dismissed as a source of Americans\u2019 unhappiness. The survey found that 66 percent of Americans stopped using a product or used less of it because of inflation, while 51 percent reduced their savings in response to higher prices. Among people without health insurance, 42 percent went without medical treatment because they couldn\u2019t afford it, versus 26 percent among the insured.",
      "A useful function of surveys such as this one is to remind us how many Americans struggle to get by even when the economy is growing. Numbers that are pointing in the right direction are still pretty bad. For example, the Fed survey asked people how they would cover an emergency expense of $400. Only 63 percent said they would pay for it using cash, savings or a credit card that they would fully pay off at the next statement. While that was better than the 50 percent who said in 2013 that they would do so, it\u2019s still a shockingly small share. The rest said they would have to borrow, sell something or simply not pay the expense. And remember that inflation has made $400 emergency expenses more common.",
      "I don\u2019t want to deluge you with statistics, but I would like to finish with one interesting survey question, which is whether people would choose a different field of study if they had a chance to do things over again. People whose most recent educational program was in the humanities or arts were the most likely to say they would pick a different field, at 49 percent. Least likely to regret their choices were engineering majors. Here\u2019s the whole chart:",
      "In Monday\u2019s newsletter I wrote that work requirements for social welfare programs don\u2019t necessarily boost employment much. A reader pointed me to a 2022 study saying the same thing is true of the earned-income tax credit, which is intended to make work more rewarding for low- and moderate-income workers by reducing their taxes or increasing refunds. \u201cApart from the federal 1993 reform, E.I.T.C. expansions have not had any clear and significant effects on employment,\u201d Henrik Kleven, a Princeton economist, wrote. That\u2019s meaningful because the E.I.T.C. \u201cdwarfs cash welfare by a factor of about 27 in terms of the number of recipients,\u201d he wrote.",
      "\u201cBut on principle, it is quite wrong to try founding a theory on observable magnitudes alone. In reality the very opposite happens. It is the theory which decides what we can observe.\u201d",

    "question": "1. How does the strong job market affect people's financial situation?",
    "answer": [
      "1. The strong job market can positively affect people's financial situation by providing them with better job opportunities, higher salaries, and improved working conditions. This can lead to increased income, which can help people achieve financial stability and improve their overall standard of living. Additionally, a strong job market can also create a sense of security and confidence in the economy, leading to increased spending and investment.",
      "2. However, the strong job market can also negatively affect people's financial situation by leading to increased competition for jobs, higher living costs, and reduced job security. This can put pressure on people to work longer hours or accept lower pay to maintain their financial stability, leading to decreased quality of life and reduced job satisfaction. Furthermore, a strong job market can also lead to inflation, which can erode the purchasing power of people's income over time.",
      "3. In conclusion, the strong job market can have both positive and negative effects on people's financial situation. While it can provide opportunities for better employment and income, it can also lead to increased competition and reduced job security. Therefore, it is important for individuals and policymakers to carefully consider the potential impacts of a strong job market on the overall financial well-being of the population."

    "answer": [
      "The main reason for the widening gap between people's perception of their personal financial situation and the national economic situation is due to the lack of understanding of economic indicators and the role they play in determining the overall financial health of a country. People tend to focus on their own personal financial situation, such as their income, savings, and expenses, without considering the larger economic picture. This can lead to a misperception of their financial situation compared to the national economic situation, as they may not understand how their personal financial situation is affected by the broader economic factors.",
      "Additionally, the media's portrayal of economic indicators and statistics can also contribute to this misperception. The media often focuses on negative news stories, such as unemployment rates and economic recessions, which can create a sense of pessimism and fear among the general public. This can lead to a negative perception of the national economic situation, even if the overall economy is actually improving.",
      "Finally, the lack of access to accurate and reliable economic information can also contribute to the widening gap between people's perception of their personal financial situation and the national economic situation. Many people do not have the knowledge or resources to understand economic indicators and how they affect their personal financial situation. This can lead to a lack of confidence in their ability to make informed financial decisions and can further contribute to a misperception of their financial situation compared to the national economic situation."

      "In an interview last month, Justice Samuel Alito complained about excessive criticism of the Supreme Court. To him, this criticism has not identified discrete problems to be solved but rather represent bad-faith efforts by critics to do nothing more than give the public a \u201creason to question our legitimacy.\u201d",
      "The not-so-subtle implication of what has become a regular talking point for conservatives is that the court isn\u2019t \u2014 and shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 responsive to public criticism. And if that\u2019s true, it must follow that public criticism doesn\u2019t serve a legitimate purpose, especially if it is unlikely to spur meaningful reform from Congress.",
      "Yet this attempt to delegitimize public criticism fails at its inception. Even if reform from Congress is not imminent, we ought not drop the focus on another potential vehicle for reforms: the court itself.",
      "There are both historical and recent examples of how the court, in response to mounting public pressure and criticism, has changed its ways, examples that underscore the value and opportunities provided by continued public pushback today.",
      "Perhaps the most famous example of the court\u2019s responding to public criticism came in 1937. After the 1936 election, in which President Franklin Roosevelt ran as much against the court \u2014 which was blocking economic measures meant to respond to the dire conditions of the Depression \u2014 as against Gov. Alf Landon of Kansas, Justice Owen Roberts made the switch in time that saved nine, a shift that historians debate was due to Roosevelt\u2019s proposal to add six seats to the court or, more generally, in response to the broader atmospherics of the president\u2019s re-election. Either way, the court\u2019s shift was precipitated by substantial public backlash against its recent behavior, and it opened the door to an era of greater judicial deference to economic regulation and greater judicial protection of civil rights.",
      "To similar effect (albeit in a different direction), the Supreme Court of the mid-1970s responded to public criticism on the issue of the death penalty. When the justices effectively imposed a nationwide moratorium on capital punishment in 1972, the political backlash was extraordinary \u2014 at both the state and the federal level. In exchange for adopting a series of procedures designed to make imposition of the death penalty less arbitrary (at least in appearance), dozens of states and Congress aggressively pushed the court to reauthorize capital punishment. On July 2, 1976, the court acquiesced.",
      "In the past 18 months, we\u2019ve seen a similar \u2014 if subtler \u2014 shift in the court\u2019s behavior that again closely correlates with public criticism and pushback. In this case, it has been related to how the justices issue unsigned and (usually) unexplained orders concerning applications for emergency relief, on what Will Baude, a University of Chicago law professor, first called \u201cthe shadow docket.\u201d",
      "Starting in 2017, there was a great shift in how the conservative majority used unsigned, unexplained orders, especially in the context of applications for emergency relief (to freeze or unfreeze lower-court rulings while a case works its way through the courts). Far more than ever before, the justices started using these orders in ways that had nationwide implications \u2014 allowing, for example, President Donald Trump to carry out a series of immigration policies that lower courts had struck down (and no court would ever uphold) and blocking a series of Covid mitigation measures in blue states on novel religious liberty grounds.",
      "By contrast, the court showed nowhere near the same appetite to intervene to protect President Biden\u2019s policies or to block controversial laws in red states \u2014 like Texas\u2019 six-week abortion ban, which the court, in September 2021, allowed to go into effect, nearly 10 months before it overruled Roe v. Wade. As Justice Elena Kagan charged in her short dissent on the court\u2019s refusal to intervene in the Texas case, the conservative majority\u2019s behavior on the shadow docket had become increasingly \u201cunreasoned, inconsistent and impossible to defend.\u201d",
      "But then something strange happened: In a little-noticed October 2021 ruling refusing to block Maine\u2019s Covid vaccine mandate for health care workers, Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote a cryptic concurrence (which Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined) suggesting that just because an applicant had made a case for emergency relief from the court didn\u2019t mean the justices had to intervene. Rather, the court should use its discretion, she argued, much as it does in deciding the cases to which it will give full consideration. She didn\u2019t say what would guide that discretion, but her brief concurrence was a turning point. To underscore that, in spring of 2022 in an emergency relief case involving environmental regulation, Chief Justice John Roberts strikingly joined a dissent by Justice Kagan, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, emphasizing concerns about the procedural shortcuts the other conservative justices had been taking.",
      "Since then, the court has intervened far less often and in ways that have looked far less partisan even when it has granted emergency relief.",
      "Consider the court\u2019s decision last month to preserve nationwide access to the abortion drug mifepristone \u2014 a ruling from which only Justices Clarence Thomas and Alito publicly dissented. What changed some of the conservative justices\u2019 minds? We\u2019ll never know for sure, but the biggest thing that happened between the rulings in the Texas abortion case on Sept. 1, 2021, and in the Maine vaccine case on Oct. 29, 2021, was the tremendous public reaction to the earlier one. The Texas ruling brought the shadow docket into the mainstream \u2014 and the mainstream media, as an article published by The Chicago Policy Review noted. The consequences of the court\u2019s shadow docket behavior became highly visible for nonexperts to see. And once the shadow docket went mainstream, public backlash followed.",
      "We will all disagree as to whether public criticism of the court in specific contexts is fair. But what can\u2019t be denied is that public pressure on the court has been, both historically and recently, a meaningful check on the institution\u2019s excesses \u2014 and an essential means by which the public is able to hold unelected and otherwise unaccountable judges and justices to account.",
      "In the case of the shadow docket, it has led the court to tamp down its aggressiveness and try to provide more explanations for its less justified interventions. In the hotly debated case of ethics reform going on now, all nine justices have already publicly committed to following at least broad ethical norms. The court can go further, and it can (and should) adopt formal internal mechanisms to enforce whatever rules the justices agree to bind themselves to \u2014 much in the way that internal inspectors general hold the executive and legislative branches to account.",
      "The point is not that any one set of reforms is a magic bullet. Rather, it is that a court whose legitimacy depends at least to some degree on public support is not, should not be and never has been immune to criticism and pressure from the same public."

And if that\u2019s true, it must follow that public criticism doesn\u2019t serve a legitimate purpose, especially if it is unlikely to spur meaningful reform from Congress.",
      "Yet this attempt to delegitimize public criticism fails at its inception. Even if reform from Congress is not imminent, we ought not drop the focus on another potential vehicle for reforms: the court itself.",
      "There are both historical and recent examples of how the court, in response to mounting public pressure and criticism, has changed its ways, examples that underscore the value and opportunities provided by continued public pushback today.",
      "Perhaps the most famous example of the court\u2019s responding to public criticism came in 1937. After the 1936 election, in which President Franklin Roosevelt ran as much against the court \u2014 which was blocking economic measures meant to respond to the dire conditions of the Depression \u2014 as against Gov. Alf Landon of Kansas, Justice Owen Roberts made the switch in time that saved nine, a shift that historians debate was due to Roosevelt\u2019s proposal to add six seats to the court or, more generally, in response to the broader atmospherics of the president\u2019s re-election. Either way, the court\u2019s shift was precipitated by substantial public backlash against its recent behavior, and it opened the door to an era of greater judicial deference to economic regulation and greater judicial protection of civil rights.",
      "To similar effect (albeit in a different direction), the Supreme Court of the mid-1970s responded to public criticism on the issue of the death penalty. When the justices effectively imposed a nationwide moratorium on capital punishment in 1972, the political backlash was extraordinary \u2014 at both the state and the federal level. In exchange for adopting a series of procedures designed to make imposition of the death penalty less arbitrary (at least in appearance), dozens of states and Congress aggressively pushed the court to reauthorize capital punishment. On July 2, 1976, the court acquiesced.",
      "In the past 18 months, we\u2019ve seen a similar \u2014 if subtler \u2014 shift in the court\u2019s behavior that again closely correlates with public criticism and pushback. In this case, it has been related to how the justices issue unsigned and (usually) unexplained orders concerning applications for emergency relief, on what Will Baude, a University of Chicago law professor, first called \u201cthe shadow docket.\u201d",
      "Starting in 2017, there was a great shift in how the conservative majority used unsigned, unexplained orders, especially in the context of applications for emergency relief (to freeze or unfreeze lower-court rulings while a case works its way through the courts). Far more than ever before, the justices started using these orders in ways that had nationwide implications \u2014 allowing, for example, President Donald Trump to carry out a series of immigration policies that lower courts had struck down (and no court would ever uphold) and blocking a series of Covid mitigation measures in blue states on novel religious liberty grounds.",
      "By contrast, the court showed nowhere near the same appetite to intervene to protect President Biden\u2019s policies or to block controversial laws in red states \u2014 like Texas\u2019 six-week abortion ban, which the court, in September 2021, allowed to go into effect, nearly 10 months before it overruled Roe v. Wade. As Justice Elena Kagan charged in her short dissent on the court\u2019s refusal to intervene in the Texas case, the conservative majority\u2019s behavior on the shadow docket had become increasingly \u201cunreasoned, inconsistent and impossible to defend.\u201d",
      "But then something strange happened: In a little-noticed October 2021 ruling refusing to block Maine\u2019s Covid vaccine mandate for health care workers, Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote a cryptic concurrence (which Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined) suggesting that just because an applicant had made a case for emergency relief from the court didn\u2019t mean the justices had to intervene. Rather, the court should use its discretion, she argued, much as it does in deciding the cases to which it will give full consideration. She didn\u2019t say what would guide that discretion, but her brief concurrence was a turning point. To underscore that, in spring of 2022 in an emergency relief case involving environmental regulation, Chief Justice John Roberts strikingly joined a dissent by Justice Kagan, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, emphasizing concerns about the procedural shortcuts the other conservative justices had been taking.",

We\u2019ll never know for sure, but the biggest thing that happened between the rulings in the Texas abortion case on Sept. 1, 2021, and in the Maine vaccine case on Oct. 29, 2021, was the tremendous public reaction to the earlier one. The Texas ruling brought the shadow docket into the mainstream \u2014 and the mainstream media, as an article published by The Chicago Policy Review noted. The consequences of the court\u2019s shadow docket behavior became highly visible for nonexperts to see. And once the shadow docket went mainstream, public backlash followed.",
      "We will all disagree as to whether public criticism of the court in specific contexts is fair. But what can\u2019t be denied is that public pressure on the court has been, both historically and recently, a meaningful check on the institution\u2019s excesses \u2014 and an essential means by which the public is able to hold unelected and otherwise unaccountable judges and justices to account.",
      "In the case of the shadow docket, it has led the court to tamp down its aggressiveness and try to provide more explanations for its less justified interventions. In the hotly debated case of ethics reform going on now, all nine justices have already publicly committed to following at least broad ethical norms.

      "In an interview last month, Justice Samuel Alito complained about excessive criticism of the Supreme Court. To him, this criticism has not identified discrete problems to be solved but rather represent bad-faith efforts by critics to do nothing more than give the public a \u201creason to question our legitimacy.\u201d",
      "The not-so-subtle implication of what has become a regular talking point for conservatives is that the court isn\u2019t \u2014 and shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 responsive to public criticism. And if that\u2019s true, it must follow that public criticism doesn\u2019t serve a legitimate purpose, especially if it is unlikely to spur meaningful reform from Congress.",
      "Yet this attempt to delegitimize public criticism fails at its inception. Even if reform from Congress is not imminent, we ought not drop the focus on another potential vehicle for reforms: the court itself.",
      "There are both historical and recent examples of how the court, in response to mounting public pressure and criticism, has changed its ways, examples that underscore the value and opportunities provided by continued public pushback today.",
      "Perhaps the most famous example of the court\u2019s responding to public criticism came in 1937. After the 1936 election, in which President Franklin Roosevelt ran as much against the court \u2014 which was blocking economic measures meant to respond to the dire conditions of the Depression \u2014 as against Gov. Alf Landon of Kansas, Justice Owen Roberts made the switch in time that saved nine, a shift that historians debate was due to Roosevelt\u2019s proposal to add six seats to the court or, more generally, in response to the broader atmospherics of the president\u2019s re-election. Either way, the court\u2019s shift was precipitated by substantial public backlash against its recent behavior, and it opened the door to an era of greater judicial deference to economic regulation and greater judicial protection of civil rights.",
      "To similar effect (albeit in a different direction), the Supreme Court of the mid-1970s responded to public criticism on the issue of the death penalty. When the justices effectively imposed a nationwide moratorium on capital punishment in 1972, the political backlash was extraordinary \u2014 at both the state and the federal level. In exchange for adopting a series of procedures designed to make imposition of the death penalty less arbitrary (at least in appearance), dozens of states and Congress aggressively pushed the court to reauthorize capital punishment. On July 2, 1976, the court acquiesced.",
      "In the past 18 months, we\u2019ve seen a similar \u2014 if subtler \u2014 shift in the court\u2019s behavior that again closely correlates with public criticism and pushback. In this case, it has been related to how the justices issue unsigned and (usually) unexplained orders concerning applications for emergency relief, on what Will Baude, a University of Chicago law professor, first called \u201cthe shadow docket.\u201d",
      "Starting in 2017, there was a great shift in how the conservative majority used unsigned, unexplained orders, especially in the context of applications for emergency relief (to freeze or unfreeze lower-court rulings while a case works its way through the courts). Far more than ever before, the justices started using these orders in ways that had nationwide implications \u2014 allowing, for example, President Donald Trump to carry out a series of immigration policies that lower courts had struck down (and no court would ever uphold) and blocking a series of Covid mitigation measures in blue states on novel religious liberty grounds.",
      "By contrast, the court showed nowhere near the same appetite to intervene to protect President Biden\u2019s policies or to block controversial laws in red states \u2014 like Texas\u2019 six-week abortion ban, which the court, in September 2021, allowed to go into effect, nearly 10 months before it overruled Roe v. Wade. As Justice Elena Kagan charged in her short dissent on the court\u2019s refusal to intervene in the Texas case, the conservative majority\u2019s behavior on the shadow docket had become increasingly \u201cunreasoned, inconsistent and impossible to defend.\u201d",
      "But then something strange happened: In a little-noticed October 2021 ruling refusing to block Maine\u2019s Covid vaccine mandate for health care workers, Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote a cryptic concurrence (which Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined) suggesting that just because an applicant had made a case for emergency relief from the court didn\u2019t mean the justices had to intervene. Rather, the court should use its discretion, she argued, much as it does in deciding the cases to which it will give full consideration. She didn\u2019t say what would guide that discretion, but her brief concurrence was a turning point. To underscore that, in spring of 2022 in an emergency relief case involving environmental regulation, Chief Justice John Roberts strikingly joined a dissent by Justice Kagan, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, emphasizing concerns about the procedural shortcuts the other conservative justices had been taking.",
      "Since then, the court has intervened far less often and in ways that have looked far less partisan even when it has granted emergency relief.",
      "Consider the court\u2019s decision last month to preserve nationwide access to the abortion drug mifepristone \u2014 a ruling from which only Justices Clarence Thomas and Alito publicly dissented. What changed some of the conservative justices\u2019 minds? We\u2019ll never know for sure, but the biggest thing that happened between the rulings in the Texas abortion case on Sept. 1, 2021, and in the Maine vaccine case on Oct. 29, 2021, was the tremendous public reaction to the earlier one. The Texas ruling brought the shadow docket into the mainstream \u2014 and the mainstream media, as an article published by The Chicago Policy Review noted. The consequences of the court\u2019s shadow docket behavior became highly visible for nonexperts to see. And once the shadow docket went mainstream, public backlash followed.",
      "We will all disagree as to whether public criticism of the court in specific contexts is fair. But what can\u2019t be denied is that public pressure on the court has been, both historically and recently, a meaningful check on the institution\u2019s excesses \u2014 and an essential means by which the public is able to hold unelected and otherwise unaccountable judges and justices to account.",
      "In the case of the shadow docket, it has led the court to tamp down its aggressiveness and try to provide more explanations for its less justified interventions. In the hotly debated case of ethics reform going on now, all nine justices have already publicly committed to following at least broad ethical norms. The court can go further, and it can (and should) adopt formal internal mechanisms to enforce whatever rules the justices agree to bind themselves to \u2014 much in the way that internal inspectors general hold the executive and legislative branches to account.",
      "The point is not that any one set of reforms is a magic bullet. Rather, it is that a court whose legitimacy depends at least to some degree on public support is not, should not be and never has been immune to criticism and pressure from the same public."

      "In an interview last month, Justice Samuel Alito complained about excessive criticism of the Supreme Court. To him, this criticism has not identified discrete problems to be solved but rather represent bad-faith efforts by critics to do nothing more than give the public a \u201creason to question our legitimacy.\u201d",
      "The not-so-subtle implication of what has become a regular talking point for conservatives is that the court isn\u2019t \u2014 and shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 responsive to public criticism. And if that\u2019s true, it must follow that public criticism doesn\u2019t serve a legitimate purpose, especially if it is unlikely to spur meaningful reform from Congress.",
      "Yet this attempt to delegitimize public criticism fails at its inception. Even if reform from Congress is not imminent, we ought not drop the focus on another potential vehicle for reforms: the court itself.",
      "There are both historical and recent examples of how the court, in response to mounting public pressure and criticism, has changed its ways, examples that underscore the value and opportunities provided by continued public pushback today.",
      "Perhaps the most famous example of the court\u2019s responding to public criticism came in 1937. After the 1936 election, in which President Franklin Roosevelt ran as much against the court \u2014 which was blocking economic measures meant to respond to the dire conditions of the Depression \u2014 as against Gov. Alf Landon of Kansas, Justice Owen Roberts made the switch in time that saved nine, a shift that historians debate was due to Roosevelt\u2019s proposal to add six seats to the court or, more generally, in response to the broader atmospherics of the president\u2019s re-election. Either way, the court\u2019s shift was precipitated by substantial public backlash against its recent behavior, and it opened the door to an era of greater judicial deference to economic regulation and greater judicial protection of civil rights.",
      "To similar effect (albeit in a different direction), the Supreme Court of the mid-1970s responded to public criticism on the issue of the death penalty. When the justices effectively imposed a nationwide moratorium on capital punishment in 1972, the political backlash was extraordinary \u2014 at both the state and the federal level. In exchange for adopting a series of procedures designed to make imposition of the death penalty less arbitrary (at least in appearance), dozens of states and Congress aggressively pushed the court to reauthorize capital punishment. On July 2, 1976, the court acquiesced.",
      "In the past 18 months, we\u2019ve seen a similar \u2014 if subtler \u2014 shift in the court\u2019s behavior that again closely correlates with public criticism and pushback. In this case, it has been related to how the justices issue unsigned and (usually) unexplained orders concerning applications for emergency relief, on what Will Baude, a University of Chicago law professor, first called \u201cthe shadow docket.\u201d",
      "Starting in 2017, there was a great shift in how the conservative majority used unsigned, unexplained orders, especially in the context of applications for emergency relief (to freeze or unfreeze lower-court rulings while a case works its way through the courts). Far more than ever before, the justices started using these orders in ways that had nationwide implications \u2014 allowing, for example, President Donald Trump to carry out a series of immigration policies that lower courts had struck down (and no court would ever uphold) and blocking a series of Covid mitigation measures in blue states on novel religious liberty grounds.",
      "By contrast, the court showed nowhere near the same appetite to intervene to protect President Biden\u2019s policies or to block controversial laws in red states \u2014 like Texas\u2019 six-week abortion ban, which the court, in September 2021, allowed to go into effect, nearly 10 months before it overruled Roe v. Wade. As Justice Elena Kagan charged in her short dissent on the court\u2019s refusal to intervene in the Texas case, the conservative majority\u2019s behavior on the shadow docket had become increasingly \u201cunreasoned, inconsistent and impossible to defend.\u201d",
      "But then something strange happened: In a little-noticed October 2021 ruling refusing to block Maine\u2019s Covid vaccine mandate for health care workers, Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote a cryptic concurrence (which Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined) suggesting that just because an applicant had made a case for emergency relief from the court didn\u2019t mean the justices had to intervene. Rather, the court should use its discretion, she argued, much as it does in deciding the cases to which it will give full consideration. She didn\u2019t say what would guide that discretion, but her brief concurrence was a turning point. To underscore that, in spring of 2022 in an emergency relief case involving environmental regulation, Chief Justice John Roberts strikingly joined a dissent by Justice Kagan, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, emphasizing concerns about the procedural shortcuts the other conservative justices had been taking.",
      "Since then, the court has intervened far less often and in ways that have looked far less partisan even when it has granted emergency relief.",
      "Consider the court\u2019s decision last month to preserve nationwide access to the abortion drug mifepristone \u2014 a ruling from which only Justices Clarence Thomas and Alito publicly dissented. What changed some of the conservative justices\u2019 minds? We\u2019ll never know for sure, but the biggest thing that happened between the rulings in the Texas abortion case on Sept. 1, 2021, and in the Maine vaccine case on Oct. 29, 2021, was the tremendous public reaction to the earlier one. The Texas ruling brought the shadow docket into the mainstream \u2014 and the mainstream media, as an article published by The Chicago Policy Review noted. The consequences of the court\u2019s shadow docket behavior became highly visible for nonexperts to see. And once the shadow docket went mainstream, public backlash followed.",
      "We will all disagree as to whether public criticism of the court in specific contexts is fair. But what can\u2019t be denied is that public pressure on the court has been, both historically and recently, a meaningful check on the institution\u2019s excesses \u2014 and an essential means by which the public is able to hold unelected and otherwise unaccountable judges and justices to account.",
      "In the case of the shadow docket, it has led the court to tamp down its aggressiveness and try to provide more explanations for its less justified interventions. In the hotly debated case of ethics reform going on now, all nine justices have already publicly committed to following at least broad ethical norms. The court can go further, and it can (and should) adopt formal internal mechanisms to enforce whatever rules the justices agree to bind themselves to \u2014 much in the way that internal inspectors general hold the executive and legislative branches to account.",

On the other hand, if the court is perceived as biased or unfair, it can erode public trust and lead to distrust of the legal system.",
      "2. The court's behavior can also affect how the public views specific cases and the individuals involved. For example, if the court is seen as being too lenient on defendants, it can be seen as favoring certain groups over others, leading to public outcry and criticism. On the other hand, if the court is seen as being too harsh on defendants, it can be seen as unfairly targeting certain groups, leading to public distrust and criticism.",
      "3. Finally, the court's behavior can also have real-world consequences for the individuals involved in cases. If the court is seen as being biased or unfair, it can result in wrongful convictions or inadequate punishment for crimes. This can have a significant impact on the lives of those involved, both in and out of prison. Therefore, it is important for the court to be seen as fair and impartial in order to ensure that justice is served and that the public's trust in the legal system is maintained."

      "ADIYAMAN, Turkey \u2014 Adiyaman is a southern province of Turkey that a lot of people miss on a map. Too small, too poor, too pious. Too Kurdish, yet not Kurdish enough. Its neighboring provinces carry the weight of history; Adiyaman is mostly known for its loose tobacco.",
      "In the 2014 presidential election, Recep Tayyip Erdogan won 69 percent of the vote in Adiyaman. In 2018, he won 67 percent there.",
      "The earthquakes that struck on Feb. 6 left more than 50,000 people in Turkey and Syria dead. More than 6,000 died in Adiyaman alone, where more than 1,200 buildings collapsed and thousands more were heavily damaged. In those first essential hours, the state was nowhere to be seen. Victims lay under the rubble waiting for rescue teams for days.",
      "That failure was supposed to jolt places like Adiyaman out of their long alliance with Mr. Erdogan. Heading into the election on Sunday, the opposition, led by Kemal Kilicdaroglu and the Republican People\u2019s Party, the C.H.P., expected a wave of protest votes.",
      "That election was one of the closest of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s career. Neither party managed to claim an outright majority in the first round, and a runoff is planned for May 28. If Mr. Erdogan is confident that he\u2019ll succeed in the second round, it might be because of places like Adiyaman, where he won 66 percent of the vote.",
      "For some voters in Ankara and Istanbul, it seemed as if people in the southern provinces blindly voted for a president and a party that abandoned them when their need was dire. The truth is more complicated.",
      "I spent a week in Adiyaman following the work of Oy ve Otesi (Vote and Beyond), a group that monitors elections, and talking to survivors of the earthquakes about this election. People in Adiyaman are getting by again, but things are fragile. Many lost their jobs and Turkey\u2019s hyperinflation has hit the region hard. But for now the government is paying attention. Families that were made homeless by the earthquakes are starting to settle into temporary housing. In one camp, container houses sent from Qatar overheat in the sun, but the road is freshly paved. A huge poster of Mr. Erdogan nearby promised free natural gas for a year. Mr. Kilicdaroglu pledged free housing for earthquake victims on another poster, but that one was a three-and-a-half-mile drive away.",
      "Zeynep, a mother of four children whose husband was in the army, told me that supplies from the disaster relief ministry and her husband\u2019s recent raise in wages, courtesy of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government, were what allowed her to feed her family. Zeynep asked me not to use her full name for her husband\u2019s sake. She favored Mr. Kilicdaroglu and the pro-Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party, the H.D.P.

      "The earthquakes that struck on Feb. 6 left more than 50,000 people in Turkey and Syria dead. More than 6,000 died in Adiyaman alone, where more than 1,200 buildings collapsed and thousands more were heavily damaged. In those first essential hours, the state was nowhere to be seen. Victims lay under the rubble waiting for rescue teams for days.",
      "That failure was supposed to jolt places like Adiyaman out of their long alliance with Mr. Erdogan. Heading into the election on Sunday, the opposition, led by Kemal Kilicdaroglu and the Republican People\u2019s Party, the C.H.P., expected a wave of protest votes.",
      "That election was one of the closest of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s career. Neither party managed to claim an outright majority in the first round, and a runoff is planned for May 28. If Mr. Erdogan is confident that he\u2019ll succeed in the second round, it might be because of places like Adiyaman, where he won 66 percent of the vote.",

People in Adiyaman are getting by again, but things are fragile. Many lost their jobs and Turkey\u2019s hyperinflation has hit the region hard. But for now the government is paying attention. Families that were made homeless by the earthquakes are starting to settle into temporary housing. In one camp, container houses sent from Qatar overheat in the sun, but the road is freshly paved. A huge poster of Mr. Erdogan nearby promised free natural gas for a year. Mr. Kilicdaroglu pledged free housing for earthquake victims on another poster, but that one was a three-and-a-half-mile drive away.",

Zeynep asked me not to use her full name for her husband\u2019s sake. She favored Mr. Kilicdaroglu and the pro-Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party, the H.D.P.

    "question": "3. How has the election in Adiyaman been affected by the earthquake and the government's response to it?",
    "answer": [
      "The earthquake that struck Adiyaman on June 23, 2022, had a significant impact on the local election. The government's response to the disaster also played a role in shaping the electoral landscape. In this essay, I will discuss three ways in which the earthquake and the government's response have affected the election in Adiyaman.",
      "Firstly, the earthquake disrupted the electoral process and caused a delay in the election. The election was originally scheduled for June 2022, but due to the earthquake, it was postponed to a later date. This delay affected the campaigning process and may have impacted voter turnout. The government's response to the disaster also caused further delays, as officials focused on providing aid and relief to affected communities.",
      "Secondly, the government's response to the earthquake was a major factor in the election. The government's handling of the disaster was widely criticized, with many accusing it of being slow to respond and inadequate in its relief efforts. This criticism may have affected the election outcome, as voters may have punished the government for its perceived failures.",
      "Finally, the earthquake and the government's response may have also impacted voter preferences. The disaster may have led to a shift in voter sentiment, with some voters prioritizing issues such as disaster relief and infrastructure development in their decision-making. The government's response to the disaster may have also impacted voter preferences, with some voters supporting parties or candidates who they perceived as more effective in addressing the disaster's impact.",
      "In conclusion, the earthquake and the government's response have had a significant impact on the election in Adiyaman. The disaster has disrupted the electoral process, affected voter preferences, and may have impacted the government's electoral outcome."

      "ADIYAMAN, Turkey \u2014 Adiyaman is a southern province of Turkey that a lot of people miss on a map. Too small, too poor, too pious. Too Kurdish, yet not Kurdish enough. Its neighboring provinces carry the weight of history; Adiyaman is mostly known for its loose tobacco.",
      "In the 2014 presidential election, Recep Tayyip Erdogan won 69 percent of the vote in Adiyaman. In 2018, he won 67 percent there.",
      "The earthquakes that struck on Feb. 6 left more than 50,000 people in Turkey and Syria dead. More than 6,000 died in Adiyaman alone, where more than 1,200 buildings collapsed and thousands more were heavily damaged. In those first essential hours, the state was nowhere to be seen. Victims lay under the rubble waiting for rescue teams for days.",
      "That failure was supposed to jolt places like Adiyaman out of their long alliance with Mr. Erdogan. Heading into the election on Sunday, the opposition, led by Kemal Kilicdaroglu and the Republican People\u2019s Party, the C.H.P., expected a wave of protest votes.",
      "That election was one of the closest of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s career. Neither party managed to claim an outright majority in the first round, and a runoff is planned for May 28. If Mr. Erdogan is confident that he\u2019ll succeed in the second round, it might be because of places like Adiyaman, where he won 66 percent of the vote.",
      "For some voters in Ankara and Istanbul, it seemed as if people in the southern provinces blindly voted for a president and a party that abandoned them when their need was dire. The truth is more complicated.",
      "I spent a week in Adiyaman following the work of Oy ve Otesi (Vote and Beyond), a group that monitors elections, and talking to survivors of the earthquakes about this election. People in Adiyaman are getting by again, but things are fragile. Many lost their jobs and Turkey\u2019s hyperinflation has hit the region hard. But for now the government is paying attention. Families that were made homeless by the earthquakes are starting to settle into temporary housing. In one camp, container houses sent from Qatar overheat in the sun, but the road is freshly paved. A huge poster of Mr. Erdogan nearby promised free natural gas for a year. Mr. Kilicdaroglu pledged free housing for earthquake victims on another poster, but that one was a three-and-a-half-mile drive away.",
      "Zeynep, a mother of four children whose husband was in the army, told me that supplies from the disaster relief ministry and her husband\u2019s recent raise in wages, courtesy of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government, were what allowed her to feed her family. Zeynep asked me not to use her full name for her husband\u2019s sake. She favored Mr. Kilicdaroglu and the pro-Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party, the H.D.P. Her husband is in the special operation forces, fighting Kurdish insurgents. She wasn\u2019t going to vote in the first round. Maybe, she said, she\u2019d vote in the second.",
      "Sevgi, also a housewife, planned to vote but kept changing her mind. She didn\u2019t like Mr. Erdogan, at least not anymore, but she was afraid of what her family would do if they found out she voted for the C.H.P.: the party of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk and secularism; the party that once supported a ban against the head scarf in public institutions. Who knows, her family might say, what the C.H.P. would do next.",
      "On the other side of town, near the local university, Ekrem Abaci, a muhtar \u2014 a sort of neighborhood representative \u2014 ordered people around in his office. Men unloaded water jugs from the trucks that kept arriving. The disaster response ministry was sending daily deliveries of water that the muhtar could distribute among his constituency. He and the men around him all told me the same thing: Our government took care of us. It may have come late, but any country would have been the same in such a disaster. The government is not to blame.",
      "\u201cVote for Papa Tayyip tomorrow,\u201d the muhtar called out to Hakan, a graduate student with a broken arm who had come in to collect some papers. Hakan was quiet for a moment, then he told me I could restart the voice recorder that I\u2019d paused when he came in. He said that he\u2019d voted his whole life for Mr. Erdogan and his party, but he wouldn\u2019t this time. He\u2019d vote against the nepotism that has left so many graduates like him unemployed, and the bureaucratic rot that means he gets fined when he shouldn\u2019t and can\u2019t get access to benefits he\u2019s entitled to. Then he left.",
      "It\u2019s not that nothing in Adiyaman and neighboring provinces has changed: Many of the areas hit hardest by the earthquakes, which have historically supported Mr. Erdogan, shifted away from him in the first round. But when the sidewalk still crunches with leftover debris; when neighborhoods are still a mix of empty lots, where buildings once stood, and scattered tents; and when life is still a question of today, not tomorrow, a vote for change can feel like a big gamble."

      "Almost a year has passed since the Bureau of Economic Analysis announced that the U.S. economy had contracted for two quarters in a row. Some people believe, wrongly, that two quarters of falling G.D.P. is the official definition of a recession. Economic negativity ran rampant, especially but not only on the political right.",
      "The interesting question now is why, at least according to some surveys, the public remains very negative on the economy \u2014 as negative as it has been in the past amid severe economic downturns \u2014 even though those recession calls were clearly a false alarm, and the economy is actually looking remarkably strong. Or maybe the question should be why people say that they\u2019re very negative on the economy.",
      "This is a touchy subject, albeit one I\u2019ve commented on before. You don\u2019t want to say that Americans are stupid; you certainly don\u2019t want to sound like that John McCain adviser who insisted that America was a \u201cnation of whiners\u201d who were experiencing only a \u201cmental recession.\u201d",
      "On the other hand, there are now huge gaps between what people say about the economy and both what the data says and what they say about their own experience. And we have some new information on what lies behind these gaps.",
      "First, about that much-hyped \u201cBiden recession.\u201d The actual definition of a recession involves several economic indicators, and aside from those G.D.P. numbers, nothing that has happened to the economy looks remotely like a recession.",
      "Since December 2021 the U.S. economy has added almost six million jobs while the unemployment rate has fallen from 3.9 percent to 3.4 percent, a level not seen since the 1960s. And no, unemployment isn\u2019t low because Americans have dropped out of the labor force: The percentage of adults either working or looking for a job has declined, but that\u2019s almost entirely a result of an aging population, and labor force participation is right back in line with prepandemic projections.",
      "And these are good jobs, according to workers themselves. According to the Conference Board, which has been surveying job satisfaction since 1987, \u201cU.S. workers have never been more content.\u201d",
      "To be sure, the return of serious inflation after decades of quiescence rattled everyone, and not just because it reduced real incomes. (Real wages fell during Ronald Reagan\u2019s second term, but people felt pretty good about the economy anyway.) One benefit of low inflation is that it gives people one less thing to worry about; according to the American Psychological Association, inflation was a major source of stress during 2022.",
      "But inflation, while still elevated, has come way down. The inflation rate over the past six months was 3.3 percent, compared with 9.6 percent last June. The price of gasoline, a major political talking point last year, is now more or less normal compared with average earnings.",
      "And people have noticed. In October, 20 percent of Americans named inflation as the most important problem facing the nation; that\u2019s now down to 9 percent.",
      "So what\u2019s going on? The general rule seems to be that Americans are feeling good about their personal situation but believe that bad things are happening to other people. A Federal Reserve study found that in late 2021 a record-high percentage of Americans were positive about their own finances while a record low were positive about the economy. We don\u2019t have results for 2022 yet, but my guess is that they\u2019ll look similar.",
      "Partisanship surely explains much of this divergence. A newly published study shows that who holds the White House has huge effects on views of the economy; this is true for supporters of both parties, although the effect appears to be about twice as strong for Republicans. The study also finds, however, that these changes in reported views don\u2019t appear to have any effect on actual spending \u2014 that they reflect \u201ccheerleading,\u201d as opposed to \u201cactual expectations.\u201d",
      "Beyond that, there\u2019s good reason to believe that media reports about the economy have had a strongly negative bias. One thing that has gone really, really right in America lately is job creation, yet the public consistently reports having heard more negative than positive news about employment.",
      "And let\u2019s not let economists off the hook. As Mark Zandi of Moody\u2019s Analytics points out, many economists have been predicting recession month after month for the past year. Sooner or later, a recession will no doubt happen, but as he says, \u201cIn my 30-plus years as a professional economist, I\u2019ve never seen such recession pessimism,\u201d even as the economy has remained resilient. And this pessimism has surely filtered through to the public.",
      "So where does all this leave us? America hasn\u2019t yet brought inflation back to prepandemic levels, and we may yet have an economic hard landing. But so far, at least, we\u2019ve had a stunningly successful recovery from the Covid shock.",
      "While many Americans tell surveys that things are terrible \u2014 which says something about how people respond to surveys and where they get their information \u2014 this doesn\u2019t contradict that positive assessment."

      "Almost a year has passed since the Bureau of Economic Analysis announced that the U.S. economy had contracted for two quarters in a row. Some people believe, wrongly, that two quarters of falling G.D.P. is the official definition of a recession. Economic negativity ran rampant, especially but not only on the political right.",
      "The interesting question now is why, at least according to some surveys, the public remains very negative on the economy \u2014 as negative as it has been in the past amid severe economic downturns \u2014 even though those recession calls were clearly a false alarm, and the economy is actually looking remarkably strong. Or maybe the question should be why people say that they\u2019re very negative on the economy.",
      "This is a touchy subject, albeit one I\u2019ve commented on before. You don\u2019t want to say that Americans are stupid; you certainly don\u2019t want to sound like that John McCain adviser who insisted that America was a \u201cnation of whiners\u201d who were experiencing only a \u201cmental recession.\u201d",
      "On the other hand, there are now huge gaps between what people say about the economy and both what the data says and what they say about their own experience. And we have some new information on what lies behind these gaps.",
      "First, about that much-hyped \u201cBiden recession.\u201d The actual definition of a recession involves several economic indicators, and aside from those G.D.P. numbers, nothing that has happened to the economy looks remotely like a recession.",
      "Since December 2021 the U.S. economy has added almost six million jobs while the unemployment rate has fallen from 3.9 percent to 3.4 percent, a level not seen since the 1960s. And no, unemployment isn\u2019t low because Americans have dropped out of the labor force: The percentage of adults either working or looking for a job has declined, but that\u2019s almost entirely a result of an aging population, and labor force participation is right back in line with prepandemic projections.",
      "And these are good jobs, according to workers themselves. According to the Conference Board, which has been surveying job satisfaction since 1987, \u201cU.S. workers have never been more content.\u201d",
      "To be sure, the return of serious inflation after decades of quiescence rattled everyone, and not just because it reduced real incomes. (Real wages fell during Ronald Reagan\u2019s second term, but people felt pretty good about the economy anyway.) One benefit of low inflation is that it gives people one less thing to worry about; according to the American Psychological Association, inflation was a major source of stress during 2022.",
      "But inflation, while still elevated, has come way down. The inflation rate over the past six months was 3.3 percent, compared with 9.6 percent last June. The price of gasoline, a major political talking point last year, is now more or less normal compared with average earnings.",
      "And people have noticed. In October, 20 percent of Americans named inflation as the most important problem facing the nation; that\u2019s now down to 9 percent.",
      "So what\u2019s going on? The general rule seems to be that Americans are feeling good about their personal situation but believe that bad things are happening to other people. A Federal Reserve study found that in late 2021 a record-high percentage of Americans were positive about their own finances while a record low were positive about the economy. We don\u2019t have results for 2022 yet, but my guess is that they\u2019ll look similar.",
      "Partisanship surely explains much of this divergence. A newly published study shows that who holds the White House has huge effects on views of the economy; this is true for supporters of both parties, although the effect appears to be about twice as strong for Republicans. The study also finds, however, that these changes in reported views don\u2019t appear to have any effect on actual spending \u2014 that they reflect \u201ccheerleading,\u201d as opposed to \u201cactual expectations.\u201d",
      "Beyond that, there\u2019s good reason to believe that media reports about the economy have had a strongly negative bias. One thing that has gone really, really right in America lately is job creation, yet the public consistently reports having heard more negative than positive news about employment.",
      "And let\u2019s not let economists off the hook. As Mark Zandi of Moody\u2019s Analytics points out, many economists have been predicting recession month after month for the past year. Sooner or later, a recession will no doubt happen, but as he says, \u201cIn my 30-plus years as a professional economist, I\u2019ve never seen such recession pessimism,\u201d even as the economy has remained resilient. And this pessimism has surely filtered through to the public.",
      "So where does all this leave us? America hasn\u2019t yet brought inflation back to prepandemic levels, and we may yet have an economic hard landing. But so far, at least, we\u2019ve had a stunningly successful recovery from the Covid shock.",

Or maybe the question should be why people say that they\u2019re very negative on the economy.",
      "This is a touchy subject, albeit one I\u2019ve commented on before. You don\u2019t want to say that Americans are stupid; you certainly don\u2019t want to sound like that John McCain adviser who insisted that America was a \u201cnation of whiners\u201d who were experiencing only a \u201cmental recession.\u201d",
      "On the other hand, there are now huge gaps between what people say about the economy and both what the data says and what they say about their own experience. And we have some new information on what lies behind these gaps.",
      "First, about that much-hyped \u201cBiden recession.\u201d The actual definition of a recession involves several economic indicators, and aside from those G.D.P. numbers, nothing that has happened to the economy looks remotely like a recession.",
      "Since December 2021 the U.S. economy has added almost six million jobs while the unemployment rate has fallen from 3.9 percent to 3.4 percent, a level not seen since the 1960s. And no, unemployment isn\u2019t low because Americans have dropped out of the labor force: The percentage of adults either working or looking for a job has declined, but that\u2019s almost entirely a result of an aging population, and labor force participation is right back in line with prepandemic projections.",
      "And these are good jobs, according to workers themselves. According to the Conference Board, which has been surveying job satisfaction since 1987, \u201cU.S. workers have never been more content.\u201d",
      "To be sure, the return of serious inflation after decades of quiescence rattled everyone, and not just because it reduced real incomes. (Real wages fell during Ronald Reagan\u2019s second term, but people felt pretty good about the economy anyway.) One benefit of low inflation is that it gives people one less thing to worry about; according to the American Psychological Association, inflation was a major source of stress during 2022.",
      "But inflation, while still elevated, has come way down. The inflation rate over the past six months was 3.3 percent, compared with 9.6 percent last June. The price of gasoline, a major political talking point last year, is now more or less normal compared with average earnings.",
      "And people have noticed. In October, 20 percent of Americans named inflation as the most important problem facing the nation; that\u2019s now down to 9 percent.",
      "So what\u2019s going on? The general rule seems to be that Americans are feeling good about their personal situation but believe that bad things are happening to other people. A Federal Reserve study found that in late 2021 a record-high percentage of Americans were positive about their own finances while a record low were positive about the economy. We don\u2019t have results for 2022 yet, but my guess is that they\u2019ll look similar.",
      "Partisanship surely explains much of this divergence. A newly published study shows that who holds the White House has huge effects on views of the economy; this is true for supporters of both parties, although the effect appears to be about twice as strong for Republicans. The study also finds, however, that these changes in reported views don\u2019t appear to have any effect on actual spending \u2014 that they reflect \u201ccheerleading,\u201d as opposed to \u201cactual expectations.\u201d",
      "Beyond that, there\u2019s good reason to believe that media reports about the economy have had a strongly negative bias. One thing that has gone really, really right in America lately is job creation, yet the public consistently reports having heard more negative than positive news about employment.",
      "And let\u2019s not let economists off the hook. As Mark Zandi of Moody\u2019s Analytics points out, many economists have been predicting recession month after month for the past year. Sooner or later, a recession will no doubt happen, but as he says, \u201cIn my 30-plus years as a professional economist, I\u2019ve never seen such recession pessimism,\u201d even as the economy has remained resilient. And this pessimism has surely filtered through to the public.",
      "So where does all this leave us? America hasn\u2019t yet brought inflation back to prepandemic levels, and we may yet have an economic hard landing. But so far, at least, we\u2019ve had a stunningly successful recovery from the Covid shock.",

      "For three months, France has been in revolt: Demonstrators have marched; railroad workers have blocked tracks; barricades and buildings have been set aflame; protesters have done battle in the street with police. The most recent innovation has been tamer: People have banged pots whenever the president has appeared. The cause? President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s measure raising the retirement age from 62 to 64.",
      "This might at first glance appear to be the work of a vibrant political left wing, fighting pro-business, anti-worker policies from a center-right technocratic government. Indeed, France\u2019s labor unions \u2014 though representing a smaller share of the work force than elsewhere in Western Europe \u2014 have been united in their opposition, making them a redoubtable force. Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, who leads the left-wing coalition NUPES, has been a central figure in the parliamentary fight against Mr. Macron, nearly bringing down his government with a no-confidence vote in March.",
      "And yet it is not France\u2019s left that has benefited from the popular rebellion. It is the far right.",
      "Recent polls showed that if last year\u2019s head-to-head presidential election were held now, Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right Rassemblement National, would beat Mr. Macron handily, 55 to 45 percent. Other polls that list all possible candidates have shown that Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, despite his and his group\u2019s support for the anti-Macron movement, has gained a mere percentage point since last year\u2019s elections, hovering at around a quarter of the votes and, in some scenarios, only 20 percent.",

      "Hatred of the established order is no longer a marker of leftism, and France\u2019s recent history testifies to this. The Yellow Vests, France\u2019s last mass protest movement, which began in response to an eco-friendly hike in gas taxes in 2018, was a strange hodgepodge of positions and attitudes, and its political leanings varied from city to city and even differed from one roundabout to another where the protesters gathered.",
      "The movement rejected attempts by politicians to join them and very early developed a solid right-leaning conspiratorial element. Jacline Mouraud, whose October 2018 video helped spark the movement, later supported the far-right presidential candidate Eric Zemmour, a committed racist. A direct outgrowth of the Yellow Vests was the phenomenal popularity of the 2020 Covid conspiracy film \u201cHold Up,\u201d as was a vocal anti-mask movement.",
      "The right-wing populist current in the Yellow Vests from just a few years ago has not vanished, and it is making itself felt in the new polls. The Rassemblement National has been the face of the populist right since its beginnings, and its history has been one of growth. These polls are a sign that this move has continued, to the benefit of Ms. Le Pen.",

How the increase in retirement age was finally made law \u2014 bypassing a vote in the National Assembly \u2014 was seen as a confirmation of Mr. Macron\u2019s undemocratic, even authoritarian tendencies. The political center and center right have been neutralized by their support for the president\u2019s unpopular measure. In response, the center and center right are on the attack. It is their opponents, the centrists say, who are the true threat to democracy: the left for its support of violent protests and the far right by its very nature. Mr. Macron\u2019s ministers hammer away at this idea in the media.",
      "For its part, the left has been hampered by its own inadequacies. Mr. M\u00e9lenchon and his coalition, betting heavily that anti-Macron sentiment will benefit them, have lacked a coherent strategy, other than maintaining pressure through advocating increased mobilization while adopting disruptive tactics in the National Assembly. Last October, well before the current crisis, polls showed that their rowdiness during legislative sessions had already led many to think left-wing politicians were incapable of governing. This political mayhem has thus far helped only the Rassemblement National, which is no longer universally viewed as a political pariah.",
      "Ms. Le Pen and her party, remarkably, have become, in the eyes of many, the voice of la France profonde, the voice of reason. She has condemned the violence on the streets (though never the police\u2019s), as well as Mr. Macron for \u201closing the meaning of democracy,\u201d adding, \u201cWhen the ruler wants something and the people don\u2019t, it should not be done.\u201d She has promised that she will reverse the retirement age change if \u2014 when \u2014 she\u2019s elected.",
      "Her party\u2019s 88 members of the National Assembly, the third-largest group in the legislative body, have succeeded in further normalizing the far right by playing the role of the adults in the room. The far right is managing to present itself as the defenders of democracy, imperiled by Mr. Macron\u2019s diktats, and of stability, threatened by left-wing chaos.",
      "Is this a durable position? The Yellow Vest movement did not lead to the defeat of Mr. Macron in 2022. But those elections did see Ms. Le Pen receive more votes than her party ever had.",
      "The government\u2019s mishandling of the pension overhaul, from failing to convince the French that it was even necessary to forcing it through when it was unable to obtain a legislative majority, has increased the people\u2019s animus toward politics and politicians. Over the past four decades, every political alternative but the far right has been tried and found wanting \u2014 the Socialists of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the conservatives of Nicolas Sarkozy and the center and Mr. Macron.",
      "Though much of this held true a year ago, the change in the retirement age touched something fundamental in the French, cementing the divorce between the people and politicians. Ms. Le Pen has never held power, and so she has never failed her voters. She offers a fresh start and holds out the promise that, unlike those who have ruled France till now, she will defend the people\u2019s interests. For now, at least, this argument is perhaps the clinching one in the minds of many in France."

      "This might at first glance appear to be the work of a vibrant political left wing, fighting pro-business, anti-worker policies from a center-right technocratic government. Indeed, France\u2019s labor unions \u2014 though representing a smaller share of the work force than elsewhere in Western Europe \u2014 have been united in their opposition, making them a redoubtable force.

Other polls that list all possible candidates have shown that Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, despite his and his group\u2019s support for the anti-Macron movement, has gained a mere percentage point since last year\u2019s elections, hovering at around a quarter of the votes and, in some scenarios, only 20 percent.",

      "For three months, France has been in revolt: Demonstrators have marched; railroad workers have blocked tracks; barricades and buildings have been set aflame; protesters have done battle in the street with police. The most recent innovation has been tamer: People have banged pots whenever the president has appeared. The cause? President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s measure raising the retirement age from 62 to 64.",
      "This might at first glance appear to be the work of a vibrant political left wing, fighting pro-business, anti-worker policies from a center-right technocratic government. Indeed, France\u2019s labor unions \u2014 though representing a smaller share of the work force than elsewhere in Western Europe \u2014 have been united in their opposition, making them a redoubtable force. Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, who leads the left-wing coalition NUPES, has been a central figure in the parliamentary fight against Mr. Macron, nearly bringing down his government with a no-confidence vote in March.",
      "And yet it is not France\u2019s left that has benefited from the popular rebellion. It is the far right.",
      "Recent polls showed that if last year\u2019s head-to-head presidential election were held now, Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right Rassemblement National, would beat Mr. Macron handily, 55 to 45 percent. Other polls that list all possible candidates have shown that Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, despite his and his group\u2019s support for the anti-Macron movement, has gained a mere percentage point since last year\u2019s elections, hovering at around a quarter of the votes and, in some scenarios, only 20 percent.",
      "In a situation that seems tailor-made for a resurgence of the left, how is it that, for the moment, at least, it is not just the right but the far right that has benefited?",
      "Hatred of the established order is no longer a marker of leftism, and France\u2019s recent history testifies to this. The Yellow Vests, France\u2019s last mass protest movement, which began in response to an eco-friendly hike in gas taxes in 2018, was a strange hodgepodge of positions and attitudes, and its political leanings varied from city to city and even differed from one roundabout to another where the protesters gathered.",
      "The movement rejected attempts by politicians to join them and very early developed a solid right-leaning conspiratorial element. Jacline Mouraud, whose October 2018 video helped spark the movement, later supported the far-right presidential candidate Eric Zemmour, a committed racist. A direct outgrowth of the Yellow Vests was the phenomenal popularity of the 2020 Covid conspiracy film \u201cHold Up,\u201d as was a vocal anti-mask movement.",
      "The right-wing populist current in the Yellow Vests from just a few years ago has not vanished, and it is making itself felt in the new polls. The Rassemblement National has been the face of the populist right since its beginnings, and its history has been one of growth. These polls are a sign that this move has continued, to the benefit of Ms. Le Pen.",
      "Her rise has been assisted by the missteps of her foes. How the increase in retirement age was finally made law \u2014 bypassing a vote in the National Assembly \u2014 was seen as a confirmation of Mr. Macron\u2019s undemocratic, even authoritarian tendencies. The political center and center right have been neutralized by their support for the president\u2019s unpopular measure. In response, the center and center right are on the attack. It is their opponents, the centrists say, who are the true threat to democracy: the left for its support of violent protests and the far right by its very nature. Mr. Macron\u2019s ministers hammer away at this idea in the media.",
      "For its part, the left has been hampered by its own inadequacies. Mr. M\u00e9lenchon and his coalition, betting heavily that anti-Macron sentiment will benefit them, have lacked a coherent strategy, other than maintaining pressure through advocating increased mobilization while adopting disruptive tactics in the National Assembly. Last October, well before the current crisis, polls showed that their rowdiness during legislative sessions had already led many to think left-wing politicians were incapable of governing. This political mayhem has thus far helped only the Rassemblement National, which is no longer universally viewed as a political pariah.",
      "Ms. Le Pen and her party, remarkably, have become, in the eyes of many, the voice of la France profonde, the voice of reason. She has condemned the violence on the streets (though never the police\u2019s), as well as Mr. Macron for \u201closing the meaning of democracy,\u201d adding, \u201cWhen the ruler wants something and the people don\u2019t, it should not be done.\u201d She has promised that she will reverse the retirement age change if \u2014 when \u2014 she\u2019s elected.",
      "Her party\u2019s 88 members of the National Assembly, the third-largest group in the legislative body, have succeeded in further normalizing the far right by playing the role of the adults in the room. The far right is managing to present itself as the defenders of democracy, imperiled by Mr. Macron\u2019s diktats, and of stability, threatened by left-wing chaos.",
      "Is this a durable position? The Yellow Vest movement did not lead to the defeat of Mr. Macron in 2022. But those elections did see Ms. Le Pen receive more votes than her party ever had.",
      "The government\u2019s mishandling of the pension overhaul, from failing to convince the French that it was even necessary to forcing it through when it was unable to obtain a legislative majority, has increased the people\u2019s animus toward politics and politicians. Over the past four decades, every political alternative but the far right has been tried and found wanting \u2014 the Socialists of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the conservatives of Nicolas Sarkozy and the center and Mr. Macron.",
      "Though much of this held true a year ago, the change in the retirement age touched something fundamental in the French, cementing the divorce between the people and politicians. Ms. Le Pen has never held power, and so she has never failed her voters. She offers a fresh start and holds out the promise that, unlike those who have ruled France till now, she will defend the people\u2019s interests. For now, at least, this argument is perhaps the clinching one in the minds of many in France."

    "question": "3. Why has the far right benefited from the protests in France?",
    "answer": [
      "1. The far right has benefited from the protests in France due to their effective use of social media to mobilize and organize supporlblind and deaf individuals, the far right has been able to use social media platforms to disseminate their message and recruit new members. This has allowed them to tap into a wide audience and gain a significant amount of support from people who feel disenfranchised and marginalized by the government's policies.",
      "2. The far right has also been able to exploit the protests to promote their ideology and agenda. By associating themselves with the protests and presenting themselves as the voice of the people, they have been able to gain legitimacy and mainstream acceptance. This has allowed them to present their extreme views as a legitimate and viable alternative to the current government.",
      "3. Finally, the far right has been able to benefit from the protests by capitalizing on the frustration and anger of the protesters. By presenting themselves as the true representatives of the people's grievances, they have been able to gain the support of those who are dissatisfied with the government's response to the protests. This has allowed them to present themselves as a viable alternative to the current government and to gain a significant amount of support from people who are looking for a change.",
      "Overall, the far right has been able to benefit from the protests in France by using social media to mobilize and organize supporters, exploiting the protests to promote their ideology and agenda, and capitalizing on the frustration and anger of the protesters to gain support."

      "For three months, France has been in revolt: Demonstrators have marched; railroad workers have blocked tracks; barricades and buildings have been set aflame; protesters have done battle in the street with police. The most recent innovation has been tamer: People have banged pots whenever the president has appeared. The cause? President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s measure raising the retirement age from 62 to 64.",
      "This might at first glance appear to be the work of a vibrant political left wing, fighting pro-business, anti-worker policies from a center-right technocratic government. Indeed, France\u2019s labor unions \u2014 though representing a smaller share of the work force than elsewhere in Western Europe \u2014 have been united in their opposition, making them a redoubtable force. Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, who leads the left-wing coalition NUPES, has been a central figure in the parliamentary fight against Mr. Macron, nearly bringing down his government with a no-confidence vote in March.",
      "And yet it is not France\u2019s left that has benefited from the popular rebellion. It is the far right.",
      "Recent polls showed that if last year\u2019s head-to-head presidential election were held now, Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right Rassemblement National, would beat Mr. Macron handily, 55 to 45 percent. Other polls that list all possible candidates have shown that Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, despite his and his group\u2019s support for the anti-Macron movement, has gained a mere percentage point since last year\u2019s elections, hovering at around a quarter of the votes and, in some scenarios, only 20 percent.",
      "In a situation that seems tailor-made for a resurgence of the left, how is it that, for the moment, at least, it is not just the right but the far right that has benefited?",
      "Hatred of the established order is no longer a marker of leftism, and France\u2019s recent history testifies to this. The Yellow Vests, France\u2019s last mass protest movement, which began in response to an eco-friendly hike in gas taxes in 2018, was a strange hodgepodge of positions and attitudes, and its political leanings varied from city to city and even differed from one roundabout to another where the protesters gathered.",
      "The movement rejected attempts by politicians to join them and very early developed a solid right-leaning conspiratorial element. Jacline Mouraud, whose October 2018 video helped spark the movement, later supported the far-right presidential candidate Eric Zemmour, a committed racist. A direct outgrowth of the Yellow Vests was the phenomenal popularity of the 2020 Covid conspiracy film \u201cHold Up,\u201d as was a vocal anti-mask movement.",
      "The right-wing populist current in the Yellow Vests from just a few years ago has not vanished, and it is making itself felt in the new polls. The Rassemblement National has been the face of the populist right since its beginnings, and its history has been one of growth. These polls are a sign that this move has continued, to the benefit of Ms. Le Pen.",
      "Her rise has been assisted by the missteps of her foes. How the increase in retirement age was finally made law \u2014 bypassing a vote in the National Assembly \u2014 was seen as a confirmation of Mr. Macron\u2019s undemocratic, even authoritarian tendencies. The political center and center right have been neutralized by their support for the president\u2019s unpopular measure. In response, the center and center right are on the attack. It is their opponents, the centrists say, who are the true threat to democracy: the left for its support of violent protests and the far right by its very nature. Mr. Macron\u2019s ministers hammer away at this idea in the media.",
      "For its part, the left has been hampered by its own inadequacies. Mr. M\u00e9lenchon and his coalition, betting heavily that anti-Macron sentiment will benefit them, have lacked a coherent strategy, other than maintaining pressure through advocating increased mobilization while adopting disruptive tactics in the National Assembly. Last October, well before the current crisis, polls showed that their rowdiness during legislative sessions had already led many to think left-wing politicians were incapable of governing. This political mayhem has thus far helped only the Rassemblement National, which is no longer universally viewed as a political pariah.",
      "Ms. Le Pen and her party, remarkably, have become, in the eyes of many, the voice of la France profonde, the voice of reason. She has condemned the violence on the streets (though never the police\u2019s), as well as Mr. Macron for \u201closing the meaning of democracy,\u201d adding, \u201cWhen the ruler wants something and the people don\u2019t, it should not be done.\u201d She has promised that she will reverse the retirement age change if \u2014 when \u2014 she\u2019s elected.",
      "Her party\u2019s 88 members of the National Assembly, the third-largest group in the legislative body, have succeeded in further normalizing the far right by playing the role of the adults in the room. The far right is managing to present itself as the defenders of democracy, imperiled by Mr. Macron\u2019s diktats, and of stability, threatened by left-wing chaos.",
      "Is this a durable position? The Yellow Vest movement did not lead to the defeat of Mr. Macron in 2022. But those elections did see Ms. Le Pen receive more votes than her party ever had.",
      "The government\u2019s mishandling of the pension overhaul, from failing to convince the French that it was even necessary to forcing it through when it was unable to obtain a legislative majority, has increased the people\u2019s animus toward politics and politicians. Over the past four decades, every political alternative but the far right has been tried and found wanting \u2014 the Socialists of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the conservatives of Nicolas Sarkozy and the center and Mr. Macron.",
      "Though much of this held true a year ago, the change in the retirement age touched something fundamental in the French, cementing the divorce between the people and politicians. Ms. Le Pen has never held power, and so she has never failed her voters. She offers a fresh start and holds out the promise that, unlike those who have ruled France till now, she will defend the people\u2019s interests. For now, at least, this argument is perhaps the clinching one in the minds of many in France."

As a far-right political party, it has been a key player in shaping public discourse and policy in France. Here are three claims that highlight the role of the Rassemblement National in the French political landscape:",
      "1. The Rassemblement National has been a dominant force in the French political landscape, particularly on the issue of immigration. The party has been known for its anti-immigration stance and has called for stricter border controls and tougher policies on asylum seekers.",
      "2. Despite its controversial reputation, the Rassemblement National has managed to attract a significant number of voters, particularly in rural and working-class areas. The party has been successful in tapping into the concerns of these voters, who feel that the traditional political parties have not adequately addressed their economic and social grievances.",
      "3. The Rassemblement National has also been known for its strong leader, Marine Le Pen. As the leader of the party, she has been a powerful voice in French politics, pushing for policies that align with the party's far-right agenda. However, her controversial views on issues such as Islam and the French colonial past have made her a divisive figure in French politics."

      "The relationship between political campaigns, the news media and the public isn\u2019t exactly an interplay between independent actors. It\u2019s a web of influence.",
      "This dynamic is particularly relevant when it comes to the avalanche of headlines and polls about President Biden\u2019s age.",
      "The most recent ABC News/Washington Post poll found that 63 percent of those surveyed thought Biden didn\u2019t have the mental sharpness to serve effectively; 43 percent said the same of Donald Trump, even though their ages are only a few years apart.",
      "Let me say up front that a candidate\u2019s age and competency are always fair game in politics. It\u2019s not ageist to acknowledge the scientific reality that our bodies and minds decline in capacity as we age. It\u2019s not ageist for voters to factor that into their electoral decisions. And aging is individual: Some people appear vibrant at 80 and others worn at 50.",
      "But there are also other truths that must be considered. Headlines and polls don\u2019t just measure and reflect public sentiment; they also influence it. The persistence of a theme elevates and validates that theme.",
      "As Jocelyn Kiley, associate director of research at Pew Research Center, told me: \u201cAs with anything in journalism, more broadly, as there\u2019s a great deal of a spotlight on a topic, it raises the salience of that topic for the public, and people are more likely to consider things that are in the news as important.\u201d",
      "I also think that we as citizens and consumers of media like to think that we come to our opinions and beliefs completely on our own, and we resist the notion that those opinions have been influenced or manipulated by outside forces. But there is a growing body of research that demonstrates the opposite. We are, unquestionably, influenced by the media.",
      "This brings me to the coverage of Biden\u2019s age. It\u2019s true that if he\u2019s re-elected, Biden would be the oldest president we\u2019ve ever had. But he was already the oldest president the first time he was elected. What changed?",
      "I\u2019d argue that the biggest change wasn\u2019t the simple passage of time, but the decision of some Republican leaders to focus like a laser on Biden\u2019s age as the factor weighing against him. In an April interview, the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley said it was unlikely Biden would \u201cmake it\u201d through a second term. In this year\u2019s Republican response to the State of the Union address, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Arkansas noted that she\u2019s half Biden\u2019s age.",
      "Some observers contend that voting for Biden is essentially voting for Vice President Kamala Harris to be president, because Biden may not last another term. For Republicans, that notion offers the added benefit of allowing them to campaign against the trifecta of their disdain \u2014 a liberal who\u2019s a minority and a woman.",
      "Which brings us back to the web of influence: Campaigns elevate an issue, pollsters and journalists ask whether the issue is having an effect on a race, stories are written about that effect, and as a result of the coverage, the effect is often intensified. That is the chain of custody for a political attack, but far too often, that connection and context aren\u2019t made clear. It\u2019s often presented as if these types of concerns just spring forth in voters\u2019 minds and aren\u2019t influenced by campaigns and news coverage.",
      "This happens all the time in politics.",
      "Before the 2018 midterm elections, Trump decided once again to whip up Americans\u2019 xenophobia by harping on a caravan of migrants, an \u201cinvasion\u201d he called it, heading for our southern border.",
      "Less than a month before those midterms, The Times reported, \u201cFor the last two weeks, Mr. Trump and his conservative allies have operated largely in tandem on social media and elsewhere to push alarmist, conspiratorial warnings about the migrant caravan more than 2,000 miles from the border.\u201d The Times concluded that they had largely succeeded in animating Republican voters \u201caround the idea of these foreign nationals posing a dire threat to the country\u2019s security, stability and identity.\u201d",
      "This caravan drew headlines and consumed airtime. And there was at least one poll taken about the threats people thought the caravans posed. According to Politico, Trump \u201cseized\u201d on the caravan issue after his team reviewed polling from congressional districts that were competitive in the 2016 election and found that border issues resonated with voters in those districts.",
      "But when the midterms were over, Trump backburnered the caravan issue and so did the media, as Quartz reported. And as the publication pointed out, \u201cAttention from Trump and other Republicans helped drive the media coverage of the caravan, and cable news and newspapers either repeated the calls of alarm, or sought to ease concerns.\u201d",
      "If the caravans had been entirely of organic interest to the public, more robust coverage probably would have continued. Instead, in that case, we saw how a political party weaponized a topic and the media helped deploy the weapon.",
      "This doesn\u2019t mean that immigration and border security aren\u2019t independently newsworthy, but rather that the media doesn\u2019t simply cover campaigns; editorial decisions can be influenced by those campaigns and coverage can influence voters as much as it informs them.",
      "This is playing out again. The idea that voters are worried about Biden\u2019s age and capacity has been repeated so often that it no longer requires any proof beyond polling that reflects what respondents have consumed: reports that they\u2019re worried about Biden\u2019s age and capacity.",
      "There\u2019s a real chicken-egg conundrum here.",
      "And as Nate Silver, the founder of FiveThirtyEight, who generally believes media should \u201cfocus more and not less on the health and mental fitness of elected officials,\u201d told me via email, it\u2019s unclear how much the age issue will affect votes for Biden, anyway. As Silver put it: \u201cIn the abstract, voters raise high levels of concern but \u2014 they also did so in 2020 and he won both the primary and the general. And his approval ratings, while not great, are roughly in line with what you might expect given high polarization and high inflation.\u201d",
      "Breathless headlines have created a sense that worry about the president\u2019s age is common knowledge and common sense, when in fact it is, at least in part, fueled by political manipulation and media complicity."
    ],
    "question": "1. How does the media influence public opinion on political issues?",
    "answer": [
      "The media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion on political issues. Firstly, the media serves as a major source of information for the public, and it has the power to shape how people perceive political issues. The media can selectively report on certain issues, highlight certain aspects of a story, and frame it in a particular way that can influence public opinion. For example, if a news outlet focuses more on the negative aspects of a policy, it can create a negative perception of the policy among the public.",
      "Secondly, the media can influence public opinion through its use of language and imagery. Words and phrases can evoke certain emotions and attitudes in people, and the media can use language to create a particular tone or mood that can influence public opinion. For example, a news report that uses words like \"crisis\" or \"emergency\" can create a sense of urgency and panic among the public. Similarly, images and visuals can also shape public opinion. For instance, a graphic showing the rise in crime rates can create a sense of fear among the public.",
      "Finally, the media can also influence public opinion through its use of celebrities and influencers. Celebrities and influencers can use their platforms to promote certain political issues or candidates, and their endorsements can carry a lot of weight among the public. For example, if a celebrity endorses a political candidate, it can create a positive perception of the candidate among their fans.",

It can influence public opinion through its selective reporting, use of language and imagery, and celebrity endorsements. As such, it is important for the public to critically evaluate the information they receive from the media and consider multiple perspectives when forming their opinions on political issues."

But there is a growing body of research that demonstrates the opposite. We are, unquestionably, influenced by the media.",
      "This brings me to the coverage of Biden\u2019s age. It\u2019s true that if he\u2019s re-elected, Biden would be the oldest president we\u2019ve ever had. But he was already the oldest president the first time he was elected. What changed?",
      "I\u2019d argue that the biggest change wasn\u2019t the simple passage of time, but the decision of some Republican leaders to focus like a laser on Biden\u2019s age as the factor weighing against him. In an April interview, the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley said it was unlikely Biden would \u201cmake it\u201d through a second term. In this year\u2019s Republican response to the State of the Union address, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Arkansas noted that she\u2019s half Biden\u2019s age.",
      "Some observers contend that voting for Biden is essentially voting for Vice President Kamala Harris to be president, because Biden may not last another term. For Republicans, that notion offers the added benefit of allowing them to campaign against the trifecta of their disdain \u2014 a liberal who\u2019s a minority and a woman.",
      "Which brings us back to the web of influence: Campaigns elevate an issue, pollsters and journalists ask whether the issue is having an effect on a race, stories are written about that effect, and as a result of the coverage, the effect is often intensified. That is the chain of custody for a political attack, but far too often, that connection and context aren\u2019t made clear. It\u2019s often presented as if these types of concerns just spring forth in voters\u2019 minds and aren\u2019t influenced by campaigns and news coverage.",
      "This happens all the time in politics.",
      "Before the 2018 midterm elections, Trump decided once again to whip up Americans\u2019 xenophobia by harping on a caravan of migrants, an \u201cinvasion\u201d he called it, heading for our southern border.",
      "Less than a month before those midterms, The Times reported, \u201cFor the last two weeks, Mr. Trump and his conservative allies have operated largely in tandem on social media and elsewhere to push alarmist, conspiratorial warnings about the migrant caravan more than 2,000 miles from the border.\u201d The Times concluded that they had largely succeeded in animating Republican voters \u201caround the idea of these foreign nationals posing a dire threat to the country\u2019s security, stability and identity.\u201d",
      "This caravan drew headlines and consumed airtime. And there was at least one poll taken about the threats people thought the caravans posed. According to Politico, Trump \u201cseized\u201d on the caravan issue after his team reviewed polling from congressional districts that were competitive in the 2016 election and found that border issues resonated with voters in those districts.",
      "But when the midterms were over, Trump backburnered the caravan issue and so did the media, as Quartz reported. And as the publication pointed out, \u201cAttention from Trump and other Republicans helped drive the media coverage of the caravan, and cable news and newspapers either repeated the calls of alarm, or sought to ease concerns.\u201d",
      "If the caravans had been entirely of organic interest to the public, more robust coverage probably would have continued. Instead, in that case, we saw how a political party weaponized a topic and the media helped deploy the weapon.",
      "This doesn\u2019t mean that immigration and border security aren\u2019t independently newsworthy, but rather that the media doesn\u2019t simply cover campaigns; editorial decisions can be influenced by those campaigns and coverage can influence voters as much as it informs them.",
      "This is playing out again. The idea that voters are worried about Biden\u2019s age and capacity has been repeated so often that it no longer requires any proof beyond polling that reflects what respondents have consumed: reports that they\u2019re worried about Biden\u2019s age and capacity.",
      "There\u2019s a real chicken-egg conundrum here.",
      "And as Nate Silver, the founder of FiveThirtyEight, who generally believes media should \u201cfocus more and not less on the health and mental fitness of elected officials,\u201d told me via email, it\u2019s unclear how much the age issue will affect votes for Biden, anyway. As Silver put it: \u201cIn the abstract, voters raise high levels of concern but \u2014 they also did so in 2020 and he won both the primary and the general. And his approval ratings, while not great, are roughly in line with what you might expect given high polarization and high inflation.\u201d",
      "Breathless headlines have created a sense that worry about the president\u2019s age is common knowledge and common sense, when in fact it is, at least in part, fueled by political manipulation and media complicity."
    ],
    "question": "2. What role does age play in political campaigns and media coverage?",
    "answer": [
      "Age plays a significant role in political campaigns and media coverage. The perception of youth and inexperience can be a disadvantage for candidates, while the perception of experience and stability can be an advantage. Media coverage of political campaigns often focuses on the age of candidates, with younger candidates being seen as more dynamic and innovative, while older candidates are seen as more established and experienced.",
      "One claim is that age can be a barrier to entry for younger candidates, as they may face stereotypes and biases that prevent them from being taken seriously. This can be seen in the 2020 US presidential election, where many younger candidates struggled to gain traction against more established candidates. For example, Pete Buttigieg, the youngest candidate in the race, faced criticism for his lack of experience and his youthful appearance.",
      "Another claim is that age can be an asset for older candidates, as they may be seen as more reliable and stable. This can be seen in the 2016 US presidential election, where Hillary Clinton was seen as a more reliable choice due to her extensive experience in politics. However, this can also lead to the perception that older candidates are out of touch with younger generations and their concerns.",
      "Finally, age can also play a role in media coverage of political campaigns. Media outlets may focus more on the age of candidates, particularly if they are young or old, which can lead to a narrow focus on age rather than the candidate's policies or qualifications. This can be seen in the 2016 US presidential election, where media coverage often focused on the age and experience of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, rather than their policy proposals.",
      "In conclusion, age plays a significant role in political campaigns and media coverage, and can be both a barrier and an asset for candidates. It is important for media outlets to focus on the candidate's qualifications and policies, rather than their age, to ensure a more fair and balanced coverage of political campaigns."

      "This caravan drew headlines and consumed airtime. And there was at least one poll taken about the threats people thought the caravans posed. According to Politico, Trump \u201cseized\u201d on the caravan issue after his team reviewed polling from congressional districts that were competitive in the 2016 election and found that border issues resonated with voters in those districts.",
      "But when the midterms were over, Trump backburnered the caravan issue and so did the media, as Quartz reported. And as the publication pointed out, \u201cAttention from Trump and other Republicans helped drive the media coverage of the caravan, and cable news and newspapers either repeated the calls of alarm, or sought to ease concerns.\u201d",
      "If the caravans had been entirely of organic interest to the public, more robust coverage probably would have continued. Instead, in that case, we saw how a political party weaponized a topic and the media helped deploy the weapon.",
      "This doesn\u2019t mean that immigration and border security aren\u2019t independently newsworthy, but rather that the media doesn\u2019t simply cover campaigns; editorial decisions can be influenced by those campaigns and coverage can influence voters as much as it informs them.",
      "This is playing out again. The idea that voters are worried about Biden\u2019s age and capacity has been repeated so often that it no longer requires any proof beyond polling that reflects what respondents have consumed: reports that they\u2019re worried about Biden\u2019s age and capacity.",

As Silver put it: \u201cIn the abstract, voters raise high levels of concern but \u2014 they also did so in 2020 and he won both the primary and the general. And his approval ratings, while not great, are roughly in line with what you might expect given high polarization and high inflation.\u201d",

    "question": "3. How does the coverage of political issues affect voter opinions?",
    "answer": [
      "The coverage of political issues in the media can significantly affect voter opinions. Here are three claims to support this argument:",
      "1. The media has a significant influence on how voters perceive political issues, and this perception can shape their opinions. For example, if a political issue is given extensive coverage in the media, it is likely to receive more attention from voters. If the coverage is biased or one-sided, it can influence voters' perceptions of the issue and, in turn, their opinions on it.",
      "2. The media's coverage of political issues can also impact how voters view political parties and candidates. For example, if a political party is given positive coverage in the media, it may be perceived more favorably by voters. Conversely, negative coverage of a political party or candidate can damage their reputation and affect voter opinions.",
      "3. Additionally, the media's coverage of political issues can impact how voters perceive the political system as a whole. If the media covers political issues in a balanced and fair manner, it can increase voter confidence in the political system. However, if the media is biased or sensationalizes political issues, it can erode voter confidence in the political system and lead to mistrust of political institutions."

      "The relationship between political campaigns, the news media and the public isn\u2019t exactly an interplay between independent actors. It\u2019s a web of influence.",
      "This dynamic is particularly relevant when it comes to the avalanche of headlines and polls about President Biden\u2019s age.",
      "The most recent ABC News/Washington Post poll found that 63 percent of those surveyed thought Biden didn\u2019t have the mental sharpness to serve effectively; 43 percent said the same of Donald Trump, even though their ages are only a few years apart.",
      "Let me say up front that a candidate\u2019s age and competency are always fair game in politics. It\u2019s not ageist to acknowledge the scientific reality that our bodies and minds decline in capacity as we age. It\u2019s not ageist for voters to factor that into their electoral decisions. And aging is individual: Some people appear vibrant at 80 and others worn at 50.",
      "But there are also other truths that must be considered. Headlines and polls don\u2019t just measure and reflect public sentiment; they also influence it. The persistence of a theme elevates and validates that theme.",
      "As Jocelyn Kiley, associate director of research at Pew Research Center, told me: \u201cAs with anything in journalism, more broadly, as there\u2019s a great deal of a spotlight on a topic, it raises the salience of that topic for the public, and people are more likely to consider things that are in the news as important.\u201d",
      "I also think that we as citizens and consumers of media like to think that we come to our opinions and beliefs completely on our own, and we resist the notion that those opinions have been influenced or manipulated by outside forces. But there is a growing body of research that demonstrates the opposite. We are, unquestionably, influenced by the media.",
      "This brings me to the coverage of Biden\u2019s age. It\u2019s true that if he\u2019s re-elected, Biden would be the oldest president we\u2019ve ever had. But he was already the oldest president the first time he was elected. What changed?",
      "I\u2019d argue that the biggest change wasn\u2019t the simple passage of time, but the decision of some Republican leaders to focus like a laser on Biden\u2019s age as the factor weighing against him. In an April interview, the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley said it was unlikely Biden would \u201cmake it\u201d through a second term. In this year\u2019s Republican response to the State of the Union address, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Arkansas noted that she\u2019s half Biden\u2019s age.",
      "Some observers contend that voting for Biden is essentially voting for Vice President Kamala Harris to be president, because Biden may not last another term. For Republicans, that notion offers the added benefit of allowing them to campaign against the trifecta of their disdain \u2014 a liberal who\u2019s a minority and a woman.",
      "Which brings us back to the web of influence: Campaigns elevate an issue, pollsters and journalists ask whether the issue is having an effect on a race, stories are written about that effect, and as a result of the coverage, the effect is often intensified. That is the chain of custody for a political attack, but far too often, that connection and context aren\u2019t made clear. It\u2019s often presented as if these types of concerns just spring forth in voters\u2019 minds and aren\u2019t influenced by campaigns and news coverage.",

    "context": [
      "The relationship between political campaigns, the news media and the public isn\u2019t exactly an interplay between independent actors. It\u2019s a web of influence.",
      "This dynamic is particularly relevant when it comes to the avalanche of headlines and polls about President Biden\u2019s age.",
      "The most recent ABC News/Washington Post poll found that 63 percent of those surveyed thought Biden didn\u2019t have the mental sharpness to serve effectively; 43 percent said the same of Donald Trump, even though their ages are only a few years apart.",
      "Let me say up front that a candidate\u2019s age and competency are always fair game in politics. It\u2019s not ageist to acknowledge the scientific reality that our bodies and minds decline in capacity as we age. It\u2019s not ageist for voters to factor that into their electoral decisions. And aging is individual: Some people appear vibrant at 80 and others worn at 50.",
      "But there are also other truths that must be considered. Headlines and polls don\u2019t just measure and reflect public sentiment; they also influence it. The persistence of a theme elevates and validates that theme.",
      "As Jocelyn Kiley, associate director of research at Pew Research Center, told me: \u201cAs with anything in journalism, more broadly, as there\u2019s a great deal of a spotlight on a topic, it raises the salience of that topic for the public, and people are more likely to consider things that are in the news as important.\u201d",
      "I also think that we as citizens and consumers of media like to think that we come to our opinions and beliefs completely on our own, and we resist the notion that those opinions have been influenced or manipulated by outside forces. But there is a growing body of research that demonstrates the opposite. We are, unquestionably, influenced by the media.",
      "This brings me to the coverage of Biden\u2019s age. It\u2019s true that if he\u2019s re-elected, Biden would be the oldest president we\u2019ve ever had. But he was already the oldest president the first time he was elected. What changed?",
      "I\u2019d argue that the biggest change wasn\u2019t the simple passage of time, but the decision of some Republican leaders to focus like a laser on Biden\u2019s age as the factor weighing against him. In an April interview, the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley said it was unlikely Biden would \u201cmake it\u201d through a second term. In this year\u2019s Republican response to the State of the Union address, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Arkansas noted that she\u2019s half Biden\u2019s age.",
      "Some observers contend that voting for Biden is essentially voting for Vice President Kamala Harris to be president, because Biden may not last another term. For Republicans, that notion offers the added benefit of allowing them to campaign against the trifecta of their disdain \u2014 a liberal who\u2019s a minority and a woman.",
      "Which brings us back to the web of influence: Campaigns elevate an issue, pollsters and journalists ask whether the issue is having an effect on a race, stories are written about that effect, and as a result of the coverage, the effect is often intensified. That is the chain of custody for a political attack, but far too often, that connection and context aren\u2019t made clear. It\u2019s often presented as if these types of concerns just spring forth in voters\u2019 minds and aren\u2019t influenced by campaigns and news coverage.",
      "This happens all the time in politics.",
      "Before the 2018 midterm elections, Trump decided once again to whip up Americans\u2019 xenophobia by harping on a caravan of migrants, an \u201cinvasion\u201d he called it, heading for our southern border.",
      "Less than a month before those midterms, The Times reported, \u201cFor the last two weeks, Mr. Trump and his conservative allies have operated largely in tandem on social media and elsewhere to push alarmist, conspiratorial warnings about the migrant caravan more than 2,000 miles from the border.\u201d The Times concluded that they had largely succeeded in animating Republican voters \u201caround the idea of these foreign nationals posing a dire threat to the country\u2019s security, stability and identity.\u201d",
      "This caravan drew headlines and consumed airtime. And there was at least one poll taken about the threats people thought the caravans posed. According to Politico, Trump \u201cseized\u201d on the caravan issue after his team reviewed polling from congressional districts that were competitive in the 2016 election and found that border issues resonated with voters in those districts.",
      "But when the midterms were over, Trump backburnered the caravan issue and so did the media, as Quartz reported. And as the publication pointed out, \u201cAttention from Trump and other Republicans helped drive the media coverage of the caravan, and cable news and newspapers either repeated the calls of alarm, or sought to ease concerns.\u201d",
      "If the caravans had been entirely of organic interest to the public, more robust coverage probably would have continued. Instead, in that case, we saw how a political party weaponized a topic and the media helped deploy the weapon.",
      "This doesn\u2019t mean that immigration and border security aren\u2019t independently newsworthy, but rather that the media doesn\u2019t simply cover campaigns; editorial decisions can be influenced by those campaigns and coverage can influence voters as much as it informs them.",
      "This is playing out again. The idea that voters are worried about Biden\u2019s age and capacity has been repeated so often that it no longer requires any proof beyond polling that reflects what respondents have consumed: reports that they\u2019re worried about Biden\u2019s age and capacity.",
      "There\u2019s a real chicken-egg conundrum here.",
      "And as Nate Silver, the founder of FiveThirtyEight, who generally believes media should \u201cfocus more and not less on the health and mental fitness of elected officials,\u201d told me via email, it\u2019s unclear how much the age issue will affect votes for Biden, anyway. As Silver put it: \u201cIn the abstract, voters raise high levels of concern but \u2014 they also did so in 2020 and he won both the primary and the general. And his approval ratings, while not great, are roughly in line with what you might expect given high polarization and high inflation.\u201d",
      "Breathless headlines have created a sense that worry about the president\u2019s age is common knowledge and common sense, when in fact it is, at least in part, fueled by political manipulation and media complicity."

    "answer": [
      "The media can ensure that it is not influenced by political campaigns and still provide accurate coverage of political issues by maintainance of independence and integrity.",
      "One way to do this is by having a policy of political neutrality, where the media outlet does not support or endorse any particular political party or candidate.",
      "This can be achieved by having a diverse range of journalists and editors who have different political views, and ensuring that they are not involved in political campaigns.",

    "context": [
      "Hunker down, America. Here we go again.",
      "The presidential election is still a year and a half away. But on Wednesday evening, Donald Trump will elbow his way back into the campaign mainstream. At a town hall event in New Hampshire hosted by CNN, the former president will field questions from audience members and the network anchor Kaitlan Collins.",
      "The whole spectacle sounds downright chilling. The event will be live, leaving Mr. Trump more or less free to inject his lies straight into viewers\u2019 veins. He will be coming off the E. Jean Carroll verdict, upping his odds of saying something awful about women or witch hunts and how everyone is always out to get him. And even if he dials down the crazy, his re-emergence on a major prime-time platform raises vexing questions. After everything this antidemocratic, violence-encouraging carnival barker has put America through, are we really going to treat him like a normal candidate this time? How can CNN and other media outlets justify giving him a megaphone from which to dominate and degrade the political landscape? Have we learned nothing from the past eight years?",
      "Short answer: We have in fact learned much about Mr. Trump and the threat he poses to American democracy. But trying to shut him out of the public discussion or campaign process would bring its own dangers. Not only would it play into the politics of victimhood that he peddles with such infuriating effectiveness. It risks further undermining public faith in the democratic process \u2014 making the system look too weak to deal with one aspiring autocrat \u2014 and even the process itself. As with so much about the MAGA king, there are no easy fixes.",
      "Nothing that Mr. Trump has done so far legally prevents him from pursuing, or serving, another term in the White House. Yes, many voters consider his double impeachments, his role in the Jan. 6 riot and his glut of legal troubles to be disqualifying. But many others do not. Polls consistently put the former president at the front of the current Republican presidential pack. A recent CBS News-YouGov survey gave him a whopping 36 point advantage over Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida (58 percent to 22 percent) among likely G.O.P. primary voters. No other contender cracked double digits. As for the general election, a new ABC News-Washington Post poll showed him with a six-point edge \u2014 seven points with undecided leaners \u2014 over President Biden.",
      "While early polling has its shortcomings, it does serve as a reminder of Mr. Trump\u2019s enduring appeal for millions of Americans. He is a serious contender for the White House \u2014 even, heaven help us, a formidable one. To treat him otherwise would be a breach of duty by the news media, democratic institutions and voters.",
      "It\u2019s not as though Mr. Trump can be stuffed in a storage closet like a bunch of classified documents. Today\u2019s mediascape includes a host of conservative players eager to fawn all over him in the hopes of making his fans theirs as well. Just think of the embarrassing tongue bath he received from Tucker Carlson in their April sit-down. Such slobberfests should not be the primary means by which voters assess Mr. Trump. He needs to be put through his paces, like any horse in the race.",
      "Just to be clear: No one is daft enough to think that Mr. Trump and CNN are linking arms out of a selfless, high-minded commitment to the public good. They are using each other. Under new leadership, the network is looking to rebuild its reputation, and ratings, as a less crusading, more balanced news source.",
      "As for the former president, CNN is just one piece of his grand media strategy. His team has been talking up how their guy wants to push the reset button on his relationship with the fourth estate. Journalists from mainstream outlets are being invited to travel on his campaign plane. And the campaign is negotiating with other top outlets, including NBC, for face time with the candidate.",
      "This is the least surprising move ever. Mr. Trump has always been a media creation. Without the \u201cfake news\u201d he so loves to bash, he\u2019d just be another failed real estate scion hawking mediocre steaks and worthless degrees from his \u201cuniversity.\u201d",
      "More specifically, Mr. Trump\u2019s people are flogging the idea that his willingness to play with the media is proof of his bravery and manliness. \u201cGoing outside the traditional Republican \u2018comfort zone\u2019 was a key to President Trump\u2019s success in 2016,\u201d one toady recently told The Hill. \u201cSome other candidates are too afraid to take this step in their quest to defeat Joe Biden and are afraid to do anything other than Fox News.\u201d",
      "Take that, \u201cPudding Fingers\u201d DeSantis.",
      "More targeted still: Mr. Trump\u2019s canoodling with CNN twists the knife in the gut of Fox News, which of late has not been obsequious enough for his taste. This isn\u2019t simply an issue of personal spite. Threatening/scaring/cajoling Fox News back into line is important to Mr. Trump\u2019s 2024 fortunes. Whatever the network\u2019s recent drama, there is no other conservative platform like it.",
      "It\u2019s hard to know how Mr. Trump\u2019s forays beyond his MAGA bubble will go, especially starting out. The guy was an appalling president, but he has always been a top-notch pitchman with a freaky sort of charisma. And a huge part of running for \u2014 and even being \u2014 president is compelling salesmanship. That said, he is out of practice interacting with people who aren\u2019t there simply to lick his boots. He has spent the past couple of years largely cocooned in a fantasyland of his own creation, which can be tough to come back from.",
      "That makes these early appearances all the more important. CNN has as much on the line on Wednesday as the candidate \u2014 maybe more. This is about more than real-time fact-checking the candidate, though it must be established early and firmly that no disinformation will go unrebutted. Mr. Trump cannot be allowed to grandstand or slither away from awkward topics: He needs to face tough and skeptical questioning from the get-go.",
      "I do wish that CNN had waited a bit longer before relaunching Mr. Trump. Firing up the prime-time campaign coverage machine this early in the cycle isn\u2019t healthy for the American psyche under normal circumstances, much less with this singularly toxic character in the mix.",
      "But now that the Trump Show is back, the media \u2014 everyone really \u2014 needs to be demanding more from this season than past ones. The former president should be expected to undergo the same vetting rituals as other candidates: debates, town halls, non-softball interviews, candidate cattle calls \u2014 the works. He cannot be left to the fuzzy realm of social media and schmoozing with Sean Hannity-style sycophants.",
      "Voters deserve the opportunity to take a clear measure of this man\u2019s candidacy, no matter how nauseating some of us may find that process."

      "Hunker down, America. Here we go again.",
      "The presidential election is still a year and a half away. But on Wednesday evening, Donald Trump will elbow his way back into the campaign mainstream. At a town hall event in New Hampshire hosted by CNN, the former president will field questions from audience members and the network anchor Kaitlan Collins.",
      "The whole spectacle sounds downright chilling. The event will be live, leaving Mr. Trump more or less free to inject his lies straight into viewers\u2019 veins. He will be coming off the E. Jean Carroll verdict, upping his odds of saying something awful about women or witch hunts and how everyone is always out to get him. And even if he dials down the crazy, his re-emergence on a major prime-time platform raises vexing questions. After everything this antidemocratic, violence-encouraging carnival barker has put America through, are we really going to treat him like a normal candidate this time? How can CNN and other media outlets justify giving him a megaphone from which to dominate and degrade the political landscape? Have we learned nothing from the past eight years?",
      "Short answer: We have in fact learned much about Mr. Trump and the threat he poses to American democracy. But trying to shut him out of the public discussion or campaign process would bring its own dangers. Not only would it play into the politics of victimhood that he peddles with such infuriating effectiveness. It risks further undermining public faith in the democratic process \u2014 making the system look too weak to deal with one aspiring autocrat \u2014 and even the process itself. As with so much about the MAGA king, there are no easy fixes.",
      "Nothing that Mr. Trump has done so far legally prevents him from pursuing, or serving, another term in the White House. Yes, many voters consider his double impeachments, his role in the Jan. 6 riot and his glut of legal troubles to be disqualifying. But many others do not. Polls consistently put the former president at the front of the current Republican presidential pack. A recent CBS News-YouGov survey gave him a whopping 36 point advantage over Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida (58 percent to 22 percent) among likely G.O.P. primary voters. No other contender cracked double digits. As for the general election, a new ABC News-Washington Post poll showed him with a six-point edge \u2014 seven points with undecided leaners \u2014 over President Biden.",
      "While early polling has its shortcomings, it does serve as a reminder of Mr. Trump\u2019s enduring appeal for millions of Americans. He is a serious contender for the White House \u2014 even, heaven help us, a formidable one. To treat him otherwise would be a breach of duty by the news media, democratic institutions and voters.",
      "It\u2019s not as though Mr. Trump can be stuffed in a storage closet like a bunch of classified documents. Today\u2019s mediascape includes a host of conservative players eager to fawn all over him in the hopes of making his fans theirs as well. Just think of the embarrassing tongue bath he received from Tucker Carlson in their April sit-down. Such slobberfests should not be the primary means by which voters assess Mr. Trump. He needs to be put through his paces, like any horse in the race.",
      "Just to be clear: No one is daft enough to think that Mr. Trump and CNN are linking arms out of a selfless, high-minded commitment to the public good. They are using each other. Under new leadership, the network is looking to rebuild its reputation, and ratings, as a less crusading, more balanced news source.",
      "As for the former president, CNN is just one piece of his grand media strategy. His team has been talking up how their guy wants to push the reset button on his relationship with the fourth estate. Journalists from mainstream outlets are being invited to travel on his campaign plane. And the campaign is negotiating with other top outlets, including NBC, for face time with the candidate.",
      "This is the least surprising move ever. Mr. Trump has always been a media creation. Without the \u201cfake news\u201d he so loves to bash, he\u2019d just be another failed real estate scion hawking mediocre steaks and worthless degrees from his \u201cuniversity.\u201d",
      "More specifically, Mr. Trump\u2019s people are flogging the idea that his willingness to play with the media is proof of his bravery and manliness. \u201cGoing outside the traditional Republican \u2018comfort zone\u2019 was a key to President Trump\u2019s success in 2016,\u201d one toady recently told The Hill. \u201cSome other candidates are too afraid to take this step in their quest to defeat Joe Biden and are afraid to do anything other than Fox News.\u201d",
      "Take that, \u201cPudding Fingers\u201d DeSantis.",
      "More targeted still: Mr. Trump\u2019s canoodling with CNN twists the knife in the gut of Fox News, which of late has not been obsequious enough for his taste. This isn\u2019t simply an issue of personal spite. Threatening/scaring/cajoling Fox News back into line is important to Mr. Trump\u2019s 2024 fortunes. Whatever the network\u2019s recent drama, there is no other conservative platform like it.",
      "It\u2019s hard to know how Mr. Trump\u2019s forays beyond his MAGA bubble will go, especially starting out. The guy was an appalling president, but he has always been a top-notch pitchman with a freaky sort of charisma. And a huge part of running for \u2014 and even being \u2014 president is compelling salesmanship. That said, he is out of practice interacting with people who aren\u2019t there simply to lick his boots. He has spent the past couple of years largely cocooned in a fantasyland of his own creation, which can be tough to come back from.",
      "That makes these early appearances all the more important. CNN has as much on the line on Wednesday as the candidate \u2014 maybe more. This is about more than real-time fact-checking the candidate, though it must be established early and firmly that no disinformation will go unrebutted. Mr. Trump cannot be allowed to grandstand or slither away from awkward topics: He needs to face tough and skeptical questioning from the get-go.",
      "I do wish that CNN had waited a bit longer before relaunching Mr. Trump. Firing up the prime-time campaign coverage machine this early in the cycle isn\u2019t healthy for the American psyche under normal circumstances, much less with this singularly toxic character in the mix.",
      "But now that the Trump Show is back, the media \u2014 everyone really \u2014 needs to be demanding more from this season than past ones.

      "Hunker down, America. Here we go again.",
      "The presidential election is still a year and a half away. But on Wednesday evening, Donald Trump will elbow his way back into the campaign mainstream. At a town hall event in New Hampshire hosted by CNN, the former president will field questions from audience members and the network anchor Kaitlan Collins.",
      "The whole spectacle sounds downright chilling. The event will be live, leaving Mr. Trump more or less free to inject his lies straight into viewers\u2019 veins. He will be coming off the E. Jean Carroll verdict, upping his odds of saying something awful about women or witch hunts and how everyone is always out to get him. And even if he dials down the crazy, his re-emergence on a major prime-time platform raises vexing questions. After everything this antidemocratic, violence-encouraging carnival barker has put America through, are we really going to treat him like a normal candidate this time? How can CNN and other media outlets justify giving him a megaphone from which to dominate and degrade the political landscape? Have we learned nothing from the past eight years?",
      "Short answer: We have in fact learned much about Mr. Trump and the threat he poses to American democracy. But trying to shut him out of the public discussion or campaign process would bring its own dangers. Not only would it play into the politics of victimhood that he peddles with such infuriating effectiveness. It risks further undermining public faith in the democratic process \u2014 making the system look too weak to deal with one aspiring autocrat \u2014 and even the process itself. As with so much about the MAGA king, there are no easy fixes.",
      "Nothing that Mr. Trump has done so far legally prevents him from pursuing, or serving, another term in the White House. Yes, many voters consider his double impeachments, his role in the Jan. 6 riot and his glut of legal troubles to be disqualifying. But many others do not. Polls consistently put the former president at the front of the current Republican presidential pack. A recent CBS News-YouGov survey gave him a whopping 36 point advantage over Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida (58 percent to 22 percent) among likely G.O.P. primary voters. No other contender cracked double digits. As for the general election, a new ABC News-Washington Post poll showed him with a six-point edge \u2014 seven points with undecided leaners \u2014 over President Biden.",
      "While early polling has its shortcomings, it does serve as a reminder of Mr. Trump\u2019s enduring appeal for millions of Americans. He is a serious contender for the White House \u2014 even, heaven help us, a formidable one. To treat him otherwise would be a breach of duty by the news media, democratic institutions and voters.",
      "It\u2019s not as though Mr. Trump can be stuffed in a storage closet like a bunch of classified documents. Today\u2019s mediascape includes a host of conservative players eager to fawn all over him in the hopes of making his fans theirs as well. Just think of the embarrassing tongue bath he received from Tucker Carlson in their April sit-down. Such slobberfests should not be the primary means by which voters assess Mr. Trump. He needs to be put through his paces, like any horse in the race.",
      "Just to be clear: No one is daft enough to think that Mr. Trump and CNN are linking arms out of a selfless, high-minded commitment to the public good. They are using each other. Under new leadership, the network is looking to rebuild its reputation, and ratings, as a less crusading, more balanced news source.",

His team has been talking up how their guy wants to push the reset button on his relationship with the fourth estate.

That said, he is out of practice interacting with people who aren\u2019t there simply to lick his boots. He has spent the past couple of years largely cocooned in a fantasyland of his own creation, which can be tough to come back from.",
      "That makes these early appearances all the more important. CNN has as much on the line on Wednesday as the candidate \u2014 maybe more. This is about more than real-time fact-checking the candidate, though it must be established early and firmly that no disinformation will go unrebutted. Mr. Trump cannot be allowed to grandstand or slither away from awkward topics: He needs to face tough and skeptical questioning from the get-go.",

      "There are a few reasons to think that President Biden might lose his bid for re-election next year, even if Donald Trump is once more \u2014 for the third straight time \u2014 the Republican nominee.",
      "There\u2019s the Electoral College, which could still favor the Republican Party just enough to give Trump 270 electoral votes, even if he doesn\u2019t win a popular majority. There\u2019s Biden\u2019s overall standing \u2014 around 43 percent of Americans approve of his job performance \u2014 which doesn\u2019t compare favorably with past incumbents who did win re-election. There\u2019s the economy, which may hit a downturn between now and next November. And even if it doesn\u2019t, Biden will still have presided over the highest inflation rate since the 1980s. Last, there\u2019s Biden himself. The oldest person ever elected president, next year he will be \u2014 at 81 \u2014 the oldest president to ever stand for re-election. Biden\u2019s age is a real risk that could suddenly become a liability.",
      "If Biden has potential weaknesses, however, it is also true that he doesn\u2019t lack for real advantages. Along with low unemployment, there\u2019s been meaningful economic growth, and he can point to significant legislative accomplishments. The Democratic Party is behind him; he has no serious rivals for the nomination.",
      "But Biden\u2019s biggest advantage has to do with the opposition \u2014 the Republican Party has gotten weird. It\u2019s not just that Republican policies are well outside the mainstream, but that the party itself has tipped over into something very strange.",
      "I had this thought while watching a clip of Ron DeSantis speak from a lectern to an audience we can\u2019t see. In the video, which his press team highlighted on Twitter, DeSantis decries the \u201cwoke mind virus,\u201d which he calls \u201ca form of cultural Marxism that tries to divide us based on identity politics.\u201d",
      "Now, I can follow this as a professional internet user and political observer. I know that \u201cwoke mind virus\u201d is a term of art for the (condescending and misguided) idea that progressive views on race and gender are an outside contagion threatening the minds of young people who might otherwise reject structural explanations of racial inequality and embrace a traditional vision of the gender binary. I know that \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d is a right-wing buzzword meant to sound scary and imposing.",
      "To a normal person, on the other hand, this language is borderline unintelligible. It doesn\u2019t tell you anything; it doesn\u2019t obviously mean anything; and it\u2019s quite likely to be far afield of your interests and concerns.",
      "DeSantis is a regular offender when it comes to speaking in the jargon of culture war-obsessed conservatives, but he\u2019s not the only one. And it\u2019s not just a problem of jargon. Republican politicians \u2014 from presidential contenders to anonymous state legislators \u2014 are monomaniacally focused on banning books, fighting \u201cwokeness\u201d and harassing transgender people. Some Republicans are even still denying the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election, doubling down on the election-related conspiracies that hobbled many Republican candidates in the midterms.",
      "Not only do Americans not care about the various Republican obsessions \u2014 in a recent Fox News poll 1 percent of respondents said \u201cwokeness\u201d was \u201cthe most important issue facing the country today\u201d \u2014 but a large majority say that those obsessions have gone too far. According to Fox, 60 percent of Americans said \u201cbook banning by school boards\u201d was a major problem. Fifty-seven percent said the same for political attacks on families with transgender children.",
      "It is not for nothing that in Biden\u2019s first TV ad of the 2024 campaign, he took specific aim at conservative book bans as a threat to freedom and American democracy.",
      "And yet there\u2019s no sign that Republicans will relent and shift focus. Just the opposite, in fact; the party is poised to lurch even farther down the road of its alienating preoccupations. On abortion, for example, Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, says candidates need to address the issue \u201chead-on\u201d in 2024 \u2014 that they can\u2019t be \u201cuncomfortable\u201d on the issue and need to say \u201cI\u2019m proud to be pro-life.\u201d",
      "But the Republican Party has veered quite far from most Americans on abortion rights, and in a contested race for the presidential nomination, a \u201chead-on\u201d focus will possibly mean a fight over which candidate can claim the most draconian abortion views and policy aims.",
      "There\u2019s more: DeSantis is in the midst of a legal battle with Disney, one of the most beloved companies on the planet, and House Republicans are threatening the global economy in order to pass a set of deeply unpopular spending cuts to widely used assistance programs.",
      "Taken together, it\u2019s as if the Republican Party has committed itself to being as off-putting as possible to as many Americans as possible. That doesn\u2019t mean the party is doomed, of course. But as of this moment, it is hard to say it\u2019s on the road to political success.",
      "As for Joe Biden? The current state of the Republican Party only strengthens his most important political asset \u2014 his normalcy. He promised, in 2020, that he would be a normal president. And he is promising, for 2024, to continue to serve as a normal president. Normal isn\u2019t fun and normal isn\u2019t exciting. But normal has already won one election, and I won\u2019t be surprised if it wins another."

While the U.S. economy has generally performed well under his administration, with low unemployment and strong GDP growth, some economists argue that his policies, such as the Green New Deal, may hinder economic growth and job creation in the long term.",

Furthermore, if the President is found guilty, it could have significant implications for his re-election bid.",

While he has focused on appealing to younger voters, the aging of the baby boomer generation could lead to a decrease in support for his candidacy in the future.

      "There are a few reasons to think that President Biden might lose his bid for re-election next year, even if Donald Trump is once more \u2014 for the third straight time \u2014 the Republican nominee.",
      "There\u2019s the Electoral College, which could still favor the Republican Party just enough to give Trump 270 electoral votes, even if he doesn\u2019t win a popular majority. There\u2019s Biden\u2019s overall standing \u2014 around 43 percent of Americans approve of his job performance \u2014 which doesn\u2019t compare favorably with past incumbents who did win re-election. There\u2019s the economy, which may hit a downturn between now and next November. And even if it doesn\u2019t, Biden will still have presided over the highest inflation rate since the 1980s. Last, there\u2019s Biden himself. The oldest person ever elected president, next year he will be \u2014 at 81 \u2014 the oldest president to ever stand for re-election. Biden\u2019s age is a real risk that could suddenly become a liability.",
      "If Biden has potential weaknesses, however, it is also true that he doesn\u2019t lack for real advantages. Along with low unemployment, there\u2019s been meaningful economic growth, and he can point to significant legislative accomplishments. The Democratic Party is behind him; he has no serious rivals for the nomination.",
      "But Biden\u2019s biggest advantage has to do with the opposition \u2014 the Republican Party has gotten weird. It\u2019s not just that Republican policies are well outside the mainstream, but that the party itself has tipped over into something very strange.",
      "I had this thought while watching a clip of Ron DeSantis speak from a lectern to an audience we can\u2019t see. In the video, which his press team highlighted on Twitter, DeSantis decries the \u201cwoke mind virus,\u201d which he calls \u201ca form of cultural Marxism that tries to divide us based on identity politics.\u201d",
      "Now, I can follow this as a professional internet user and political observer. I know that \u201cwoke mind virus\u201d is a term of art for the (condescending and misguided) idea that progressive views on race and gender are an outside contagion threatening the minds of young people who might otherwise reject structural explanations of racial inequality and embrace a traditional vision of the gender binary. I know that \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d is a right-wing buzzword meant to sound scary and imposing.",
      "To a normal person, on the other hand, this language is borderline unintelligible. It doesn\u2019t tell you anything; it doesn\u2019t obviously mean anything; and it\u2019s quite likely to be far afield of your interests and concerns.",
      "DeSantis is a regular offender when it comes to speaking in the jargon of culture war-obsessed conservatives, but he\u2019s not the only one. And it\u2019s not just a problem of jargon. Republican politicians \u2014 from presidential contenders to anonymous state legislators \u2014 are monomaniacally focused on banning books, fighting \u201cwokeness\u201d and harassing transgender people. Some Republicans are even still denying the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election, doubling down on the election-related conspiracies that hobbled many Republican candidates in the midterms.",
      "Not only do Americans not care about the various Republican obsessions \u2014 in a recent Fox News poll 1 percent of respondents said \u201cwokeness\u201d was \u201cthe most important issue facing the country today\u201d \u2014 but a large majority say that those obsessions have gone too far. According to Fox, 60 percent of Americans said \u201cbook banning by school boards\u201d was a major problem. Fifty-seven percent said the same for political attacks on families with transgender children.",
      "It is not for nothing that in Biden\u2019s first TV ad of the 2024 campaign, he took specific aim at conservative book bans as a threat to freedom and American democracy.",
      "And yet there\u2019s no sign that Republicans will relent and shift focus. Just the opposite, in fact; the party is poised to lurch even farther down the road of its alienating preoccupations. On abortion, for example, Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, says candidates need to address the issue \u201chead-on\u201d in 2024 \u2014 that they can\u2019t be \u201cuncomfortable\u201d on the issue and need to say \u201cI\u2019m proud to be pro-life.\u201d",
      "But the Republican Party has veered quite far from most Americans on abortion rights, and in a contested race for the presidential nomination, a \u201chead-on\u201d focus will possibly mean a fight over which candidate can claim the most draconian abortion views and policy aims.",
      "There\u2019s more: DeSantis is in the midst of a legal battle with Disney, one of the most beloved companies on the planet, and House Republicans are threatening the global economy in order to pass a set of deeply unpopular spending cuts to widely used assistance programs.",
      "Taken together, it\u2019s as if the Republican Party has committed itself to being as off-putting as possible to as many Americans as possible. That doesn\u2019t mean the party is doomed, of course. But as of this moment, it is hard to say it\u2019s on the road to political success.",
      "As for Joe Biden? The current state of the Republican Party only strengthens his most important political asset \u2014 his normalcy. He promised, in 2020, that he would be a normal president. And he is promising, for 2024, to continue to serve as a normal president. Normal isn\u2019t fun and normal isn\u2019t exciting. But normal has already won one election, and I won\u2019t be surprised if it wins another."

    "question": "4. How has the Republican Party changed in recent years?",
    "answer": [
      "The Republican Party has undergone significant changes in recent years, reflecting the shifting political landscape and the evolving priorities of its constituents. One key development has been the growing influence of the Tea Party movement, which emerged in response to concerns about government spending and fiscal responsibility. This movement has pushed the party further to the right, resulting in increased emphasis on limited government, lower taxes, and reduced regulation.",
      "Another significant change has been the rise of the alt-right, a far-right ideological movement that seeks to promote white nationalism and populism. While the alt-right has not gained widespread acceptance within the party, it has contributed to a growing sense of polarization and division within American society.",
      "Finally, the Republican Party has also seen changes in its approach to social issues, such as LGBTQ rights and reproductive rights. While some members of the party continue to advocate for traditional values and religious conservatism, others have become more moderate and pragmatic, recognizing the need to broaden the party's appeal to a more diverse range of voters.",
      "Overall, these changes reflect the ongoing evolution of the Republican Party, as it seeks to adapt to the changing needs and priorities of its constituents. While the party remains deeply divided on a number of issues, it continues to be a major player in American politics, with significant influence over policy and legislation at the federal and state levels."

      "There are a few reasons to think that President Biden might lose his bid for re-election next year, even if Donald Trump is once more \u2014 for the third straight time \u2014 the Republican nominee.",
      "There\u2019s the Electoral College, which could still favor the Republican Party just enough to give Trump 270 electoral votes, even if he doesn\u2019t win a popular majority. There\u2019s Biden\u2019s overall standing \u2014 around 43 percent of Americans approve of his job performance \u2014 which doesn\u2019t compare favorably with past incumbents who did win re-election. There\u2019s the economy, which may hit a downturn between now and next November. And even if it doesn\u2019t, Biden will still have presided over the highest inflation rate since the 1980s. Last, there\u2019s Biden himself. The oldest person ever elected president, next year he will be \u2014 at 81 \u2014 the oldest president to ever stand for re-election. Biden\u2019s age is a real risk that could suddenly become a liability.",
      "If Biden has potential weaknesses, however, it is also true that he doesn\u2019t lack for real advantages. Along with low unemployment, there\u2019s been meaningful economic growth, and he can point to significant legislative accomplishments. The Democratic Party is behind him; he has no serious rivals for the nomination.",
      "But Biden\u2019s biggest advantage has to do with the opposition \u2014 the Republican Party has gotten weird. It\u2019s not just that Republican policies are well outside the mainstream, but that the party itself has tipped over into something very strange.",
      "I had this thought while watching a clip of Ron DeSantis speak from a lectern to an audience we can\u2019t see. In the video, which his press team highlighted on Twitter, DeSantis decries the \u201cwoke mind virus,\u201d which he calls \u201ca form of cultural Marxism that tries to divide us based on identity politics.\u201d",
      "Now, I can follow this as a professional internet user and political observer. I know that \u201cwoke mind virus\u201d is a term of art for the (condescending and misguided) idea that progressive views on race and gender are an outside contagion threatening the minds of young people who might otherwise reject structural explanations of racial inequality and embrace a traditional vision of the gender binary. I know that \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d is a right-wing buzzword meant to sound scary and imposing.",
      "To a normal person, on the other hand, this language is borderline unintelligible. It doesn\u2019t tell you anything; it doesn\u2019t obviously mean anything; and it\u2019s quite likely to be far afield of your interests and concerns.",
      "DeSantis is a regular offender when it comes to speaking in the jargon of culture war-obsessed conservatives, but he\u2019s not the only one. And it\u2019s not just a problem of jargon. Republican politicians \u2014 from presidential contenders to anonymous state legislators \u2014 are monomaniacally focused on banning books, fighting \u201cwokeness\u201d and harassing transgender people. Some Republicans are even still denying the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election, doubling down on the election-related conspiracies that hobbled many Republican candidates in the midterms.",
      "Not only do Americans not care about the various Republican obsessions \u2014 in a recent Fox News poll 1 percent of respondents said \u201cwokeness\u201d was \u201cthe most important issue facing the country today\u201d \u2014 but a large majority say that those obsessions have gone too far. According to Fox, 60 percent of Americans said \u201cbook banning by school boards\u201d was a major problem. Fifty-seven percent said the same for political attacks on families with transgender children.",
      "It is not for nothing that in Biden\u2019s first TV ad of the 2024 campaign, he took specific aim at conservative book bans as a threat to freedom and American democracy.",
      "And yet there\u2019s no sign that Republicans will relent and shift focus. Just the opposite, in fact; the party is poised to lurch even farther down the road of its alienating preoccupations. On abortion, for example, Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, says candidates need to address the issue \u201chead-on\u201d in 2024 \u2014 that they can\u2019t be \u201cuncomfortable\u201d on the issue and need to say \u201cI\u2019m proud to be pro-life.\u201d",
      "But the Republican Party has veered quite far from most Americans on abortion rights, and in a contested race for the presidential nomination, a \u201chead-on\u201d focus will possibly mean a fight over which candidate can claim the most draconian abortion views and policy aims.",
      "There\u2019s more: DeSantis is in the midst of a legal battle with Disney, one of the most beloved companies on the planet, and House Republicans are threatening the global economy in order to pass a set of deeply unpopular spending cuts to widely used assistance programs.",
      "Taken together, it\u2019s as if the Republican Party has committed itself to being as off-putting as possible to as many Americans as possible. That doesn\u2019t mean the party is doomed, of course. But as of this moment, it is hard to say it\u2019s on the road to political success.",
      "As for Joe Biden? The current state of the Republican Party only strengthens his most important political asset \u2014 his normalcy. He promised, in 2020, that he would be a normal president. And he is promising, for 2024, to continue to serve as a normal president. Normal isn\u2019t fun and normal isn\u2019t exciting. But normal has already won one election, and I won\u2019t be surprised if it wins another."
    ],
    "question": "5. Why might the Republican Party's focus on culture war issues be a liability for their candidates?",
    "answer": [
      "The Republican Party's focus on culture war issues, such as abortion, LGBTQ rights, and religious freedom, may be a liability for their candidates in several ways. Firstly, these issues tend to polarize voters and create a sense of us versus them mentality. This can make it difficult for the party to appeal to moderate and independent voters, who may be turned off by the divisive rhetoric.",
      "Secondly, by focusing so heavily on culture war issues, the Republican Party risks alienating other important groups, such as women and minorities. Women, in particular, may feel that the party is not on their side, as evidenced by the gender gap in voting patterns. Additionally, the party's opposition to affirmative action and other policies that promote diversity and inclusion may make it difficult to attract minority voters.",
      "Finally, the Republican Party's focus on culture war issues may also create a sense of insecurity among their base of supporters. By constantly reiterating their opposition to progressive values, the party may create a sense of crisis that can lead to anxiety and fear among their supporters. This can be particularly problematic if the party fails to deliver on its promises or if the country experiences a major crisis or event that challenges its worldview."

    "context": [
      "Joe Biden has, to nobody\u2019s surprise, formally announced that he is seeking re-election. And I, for one, am dreading the year and a half of political crystal ball gazing that lies ahead of us \u2014 a discussion to which I will have little if anything to add.",
      "One thing I may be able to contribute to, however, is the way we talk about the Biden economy. Much political discussion, it seems to me, is informed by a sense that the economy will be a major liability for Democrats \u2014 a sense that is strongly affected by out-of-date or questionable data.",
      "Of course, a lot can change between now and November 2024. We could have a recession, maybe as the delayed effect of monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve. We might all too easily face a financial crisis this summer when, as seems likely, Republicans refuse to raise the debt ceiling \u2014 and nobody knows how that will play out politically.",
      "Right now, however, the economy is in better shape than I suspect most pundits or even generally well-informed readers may realize.",
      "The basic story of the Biden economy is that America has experienced a remarkably fast and essentially complete job market recovery. This recovery was initially accompanied by distressingly high inflation; but inflation, while still high by the standards of the past few decades, has subsided substantially. The overall situation is, well, not so bad.",
      "About jobs: Unless you\u2019ve been getting your news from Tucker Carlson or Truth Social, you\u2019re probably aware that the unemployment rate is hovering near historic lows. However, I keep hearing assertions that this number is misleading, because millions of Americans have dropped out of the labor force \u2014 which was true a year ago.",
      "But it\u2019s not true anymore. There are multiple ways to make this point, but one way is to compare where we are now with projections made just before Covid struck. In January 2020 the Congressional Budget Office projected that by the first quarter of 2023 nonfarm employment would be 154.8 million; the actual number for March was 155.6 million. As a recent report from the Council of Economic Advisers points out, labor force participation \u2014 the percentage of adults either working or actively looking for work \u2014 is also right back in line with pre-Covid projections.",
      "In short, we really are back at full employment.",
      "Inflation isn\u2019t as happy a picture. If we measure inflation by the annual rate of change in consumer prices over the past six months \u2014 my current preference for trying to extract the signal from the noise \u2014 inflation was almost 10 percent in June 2022. But it\u2019s now down to just 3.5 percent.",
      "That\u2019s still above the Fed\u2019s target of 2 percent, and there\u2019s intense debate among economists about how hard it will be to get inflation all the way down (intense because nobody really knows the answer). But maybe some perspective is in order. The current inflation rate is lower than it was at the end of Ronald Reagan\u2019s second term.",
      "Or consider the \u201cmisery index,\u201d the sum of unemployment and inflation \u2014 a crude measure that nonetheless seems to do a pretty good job of predicting consumer sentiment. Using six-month inflation, that index is currently about 7, roughly the same as it was in 2017, when few people considered the economy a disaster.",
      "But never mind these fancy statistics \u2014 don\u2019t people perceive the economy as terrible? After all, news coverage tends to emphasize the negative: You hear a lot about soaring prices of gasoline or eggs, much less when they come back down. Even amid a vast jobs boom, consumers report having heard much more negative than positive news about employment.",
      "Even so, do people consider the economy awful? It depends on whom you ask. The venerable Michigan Survey still shows consumer sentiment at levels heretofore associated with severe economic crises. But the also well-established Conference Board survey \u2014 which, as it happens, has a much larger sample size \u2014 tells a different story: Its \u201cpresent situation\u201d index is fairly high, roughly comparable to what it was in 2017. That is, it\u2019s more or less in line with the misery index.",
      "And for what it\u2019s worth, both the strength of consumer spending, even in the relatively soft latest report on G.D.P., and the failure of the much-predicted red wave to materialize in the midterm elections look a lot more Conference Board than Michigan.",
      "Again, a lot can happen between now and the election. But what strikes me is that consumers already expect a lot of bad news. The Conference Board expectations index is far below its \u201cpresent situation\u201d index; consumers expect 4 percent to 5 percent inflation over the next year, while financial markets expect a number more like 2 percent. If we either don\u2019t have a recession or any recession is brief and mild, if inflation actually does come down, voters seem set to view those outcomes as a positive surprise.",
      "Now, I\u2019m not predicting a \u201cmorning in America\u201d-type election; such things probably aren\u2019t even possible in an era of intense partisanship. But the idea that the economy is going to pose a huge problem for Democrats next year isn\u2019t backed by the available data."

      "One thing I may be able to contribute to, however, is the way we talk about the Biden economy. Much political discussion, it seems to me, is informed by a sense that the economy will be a major liability for Democrats \u2014 a sense that is strongly affected by out-of-date or questionable data.",
      "Of course, a lot can change between now and November 2024. We could have a recession, maybe as the delayed effect of monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve. We might all too easily face a financial crisis this summer when, as seems likely, Republicans refuse to raise the debt ceiling \u2014 and nobody knows how that will play out politically.",
      "Right now, however, the economy is in better shape than I suspect most pundits or even generally well-informed readers may realize.",
      "The basic story of the Biden economy is that America has experienced a remarkably fast and essentially complete job market recovery. This recovery was initially accompanied by distressingly high inflation; but inflation, while still high by the standards of the past few decades, has subsided substantially. The overall situation is, well, not so bad.",
      "About jobs: Unless you\u2019ve been getting your news from Tucker Carlson or Truth Social, you\u2019re probably aware that the unemployment rate is hovering near historic lows. However, I keep hearing assertions that this number is misleading, because millions of Americans have dropped out of the labor force \u2014 which was true a year ago.",
      "But it\u2019s not true anymore. There are multiple ways to make this point, but one way is to compare where we are now with projections made just before Covid struck. In January 2020 the Congressional Budget Office projected that by the first quarter of 2023 nonfarm employment would be 154.8 million; the actual number for March was 155.6 million. As a recent report from the Council of Economic Advisers points out, labor force participation \u2014 the percentage of adults either working or actively looking for work \u2014 is also right back in line with pre-Covid projections.",
      "In short, we really are back at full employment.",
      "Inflation isn\u2019t as happy a picture. If we measure inflation by the annual rate of change in consumer prices over the past six months \u2014 my current preference for trying to extract the signal from the noise \u2014 inflation was almost 10 percent in June 2022. But it\u2019s now down to just 3.5 percent.",
      "That\u2019s still above the Fed\u2019s target of 2 percent, and there\u2019s intense debate among economists about how hard it will be to get inflation all the way down (intense because nobody really knows the answer). But maybe some perspective is in order. The current inflation rate is lower than it was at the end of Ronald Reagan\u2019s second term.",
      "Or consider the \u201cmisery index,\u201d the sum of unemployment and inflation \u2014 a crude measure that nonetheless seems to do a pretty good job of predicting consumer sentiment. Using six-month inflation, that index is currently about 7, roughly the same as it was in 2017, when few people considered the economy a disaster.",
      "But never mind these fancy statistics \u2014 don\u2019t people perceive the economy as terrible? After all, news coverage tends to emphasize the negative: You hear a lot about soaring prices of gasoline or eggs, much less when they come back down. Even amid a vast jobs boom, consumers report having heard much more negative than positive news about employment.",
      "Even so, do people consider the economy awful? It depends on whom you ask. The venerable Michigan Survey still shows consumer sentiment at levels heretofore associated with severe economic crises. But the also well-established Conference Board survey \u2014 which, as it happens, has a much larger sample size \u2014 tells a different story: Its \u201cpresent situation\u201d index is fairly high, roughly comparable to what it was in 2017. That is, it\u2019s more or less in line with the misery index.",
      "And for what it\u2019s worth, both the strength of consumer spending, even in the relatively soft latest report on G.D.P., and the failure of the much-predicted red wave to materialize in the midterm elections look a lot more Conference Board than Michigan.",
      "Again, a lot can happen between now and the election. But what strikes me is that consumers already expect a lot of bad news. The Conference Board expectations index is far below its \u201cpresent situation\u201d index; consumers expect 4 percent to 5 percent inflation over the next year, while financial markets expect a number more like 2 percent. If we either don\u2019t have a recession or any recession is brief and mild, if inflation actually does come down, voters seem set to view those outcomes as a positive surprise.",
      "Now, I\u2019m not predicting a \u201cmorning in America\u201d-type election; such things probably aren\u2019t even possible in an era of intense partisanship. But the idea that the economy is going to pose a huge problem for Democrats next year isn\u2019t backed by the available data."

The overall situation is, well, not so bad.",
      "About jobs: Unless you\u2019ve been getting your news from Tucker Carlson or Truth Social, you\u2019re probably aware that the unemployment rate is hovering near historic lows. However, I keep hearing assertions that this number is misleading, because millions of Americans have dropped out of the labor force \u2014 which was true a year ago.",

But it\u2019s now down to just 3.5 percent.",

The Conference Board expectations index is far below its \u201cpresent situation\u201d index; consumers expect 4 percent to 5 percent inflation over the next year, while financial markets expect a number more like 2 percent. If we either don\u2019t have a recession or any recession is brief and mild, if inflation actually does come down, voters seem set to view those outcomes as a positive surprise.",

    "answer": [
      "The labor force participation rate in the Biden economy refers to the percentage of the working-age population that is either employed or actively looking for work. The current state of the labor force participation rate has been a topic of discussion in recent months.",
      "One claim is that the labor force participation rate has increased under the Biden economy. This is because the administration has implemented policies such as the American Rescue Plan, which has provided job training and employment opportunities for individuals who have been displaced by the pandemic. Additionally, the Jobs Guarantee Program has provided a living wage for all Americans, which has incentivized more people to enter the workforce.",
      "Another claim is that the labor force participation rate has not changed significantly under the Biden economy. This is because the pandemic has affected different industries and sectors in different ways, and some individuals may have been displaced from their jobs, while others may have had to transition to different industries or roles.",
      "Finally, a third claim is that the labor force participation rate has decreased under the Biden economy. This is because the pandemic has resulted in a significant loss of jobs and industries, which has affected the confidence of individuals in the job market. Additionally, the shift to remote work and the use of automation has also led to a decrease in the number of jobs available.",
      "Overall, the current state of the labor force participation rate in the Biden economy is a complex issue that is affected by various factors such as the pandemic, the shift to remote work, and the use of automation."

This is a common problem that arises when the economy is operating at full employment, as there is a shortage of workers, which leads to higher wages and increased production costs.

      "Joe Biden is officially running for re-election, and his candidacy will put some Democratic voters \u2014 those not only skittish about his age but also about his passion for policy \u2014 in a vise: They recognize the threat from the leading Republican candidates, but they\u2019ve been underwhelmed by Biden, who\u2019d be 82 at the start of a second term.",
      "The age question is a major concern for Biden, according to political advisers I\u2019ve spoken to recently \u2014 and according to the chatter on cable news and online. And the sense that he has underwhelmed is particularly problematic for Biden when it comes to young voters. According to an Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School poll of 18-to 29-year-olds released Monday, just 36 percent of young Americans approve of Biden\u2019s job performance. That number has steadily dropped over the course of his presidency.",
      "Though young voters were only 17 percent of the 2020 electorate, they\u2019ll probably be a key to another Biden win, since he won about 60 percent of the 18-to-29 vote last time around. Younger voters can also be barometers of how much a candidate\u2019s passion factors into his appeal.",
      "I reached out to several voting rights advocates and political organizers to discuss Biden\u2019s bid, and the overall impression settles somewhere between cautious optimism and dampened enthusiasm not so much about Biden\u2019s age but about how voters, including younger voters, look at his policy priorities. As Clifford Albright, a co-founder and the executive director of the Black Voters Matter Fund, told me, although younger voters would generally like to see younger candidates, \u201cthe age thing can be overcome if you\u2019re talking about the right issues.\u201d",
      "Albright mentioned the presidential candidacies of Senator Bernie Sanders, who\u2019s about a year older than Biden. As a contender for the Democratic nomination, he said, Sanders was held aloft by young voters because he vociferously championed issues that they cared about. They felt that he was fighting for them.",
      "It\u2019s on those issues where some activists seemed to think Biden had left an opening for voter disappointment. They weren\u2019t na\u00efve about the structural obstacles in the way Congress operates that made legislative progress difficult, if not impossible, but they simply didn\u2019t believe that Biden went down fighting on some of the initiatives that younger Democratic voters cared about most.",
      "One that sticks in their craws, undoubtedly because they deal with voting rights, was a sense that Biden didn\u2019t fight hard enough for the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.",
      "Nse Ufot, the founder of the New South Super PAC, chastised Biden for speaking about the voting rights bill at the Atlanta University Center \u2014 a consortium of four historically Black colleges and universities, in a state where both senators were already committed to voting for the law \u2014 ahead of a push to the pass the bill, knowing there weren\u2019t enough votes to pass it. Biden \u201cshould have been in West Virginia,\u201d said Ufot, and \u201cshould have been in Phoenix, Ariz., because those are the people who need to hear it.\u201d",
      "She said it seemed almost like a coach coming to the sideline to console a team in defeat even though there was still time left on the clock and the game was still being played. It just didn\u2019t feel like an all-out effort to go down swinging.",
      "Ufot, channeling the rapper Ice Cube, said of Biden, \u201cI need you to put your back into it!\u201d",
      "But both Ufot and Albright considered the hesitation about Biden\u2019s age a bit of a red herring. For them, policy and voter engagement \u2014 and the time and resources put into both \u2014 will be more determinative.",
      "On the policy front, Albright believed that the polling for Democrats, particularly in the fall of 2022, ticked up not only because the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade but also because Biden finally took action on student loan forgiveness, the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (with the most significant climate provisions in American history) and the passage of relatively narrow but still significant federal gun legislation. A half year later, these Democratic wins can feel like old news, but they were agenda items that Democratic voters, including young voters, cared deeply about.",
      "So if Biden made gains on some of the issues that young voters care about, why are the activists still concerned?",
      "Biden\u2019s challenge when it comes to younger voters isn\u2019t so much his age but his posture, they say. He was elected in part as an antidote to the chaos of the Donald Trump years. But, as Albright said he sees it now, \u201csome of that stability that he offers, some of that comfort or whatever that he offers some folks, that has actually been, from our perspective, part of the problem.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re in a moment like what we\u2019re in,\u201d Albright said, \u201cyou have to recognize that this is not a time for the normal, the traditional, the nostalgia or whatever and that you need something different.\u201d",
      "Ufot buttressed that sentiment more bluntly, saying, \u201cPeople are trying to appear to be elder statesmen\u201d when the country is, in effect, on fire.",
      "In a certain sense, Biden\u2019s age becomes a proxy for other dissatisfactions voters may have with him. Trump is just four years younger than Biden, but he has convinced his followers that his venom is a marker of virility.",
      "Biden has to demonstrate more fight for more progressive policies. Even if he loses the battles, he has to show the scars. Positioning himself as the last line of defense against the return of Trump or the rise of an equally dangerous Republican isn\u2019t sufficient.",
      "He has to show that he is more bulldog than bulwark.",
      "As Tram Nguyen, a co-executive director of the New Virginia Majority, put it, in the next year and a half leading up to the election, \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see more \u2014 at least I hope we\u2019re going to see more \u2014 of that fight, because I think at the end of the day, voters want to vote for someone who they believe will fight for what is needed.\u201d"

      "Joe Biden is officially running for re-election, and his candidacy will put some Democratic voters \u2014 those not only skittish about his age but also about his passion for policy \u2014 in a vise: They recognize the threat from the leading Republican candidates, but they\u2019ve been underwhelmed by Biden, who\u2019d be 82 at the start of a second term.",
      "The age question is a major concern for Biden, according to political advisers I\u2019ve spoken to recently \u2014 and according to the chatter on cable news and online. And the sense that he has underwhelmed is particularly problematic for Biden when it comes to young voters. According to an Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School poll of 18-to 29-year-olds released Monday, just 36 percent of young Americans approve of Biden\u2019s job performance. That number has steadily dropped over the course of his presidency.",
      "Though young voters were only 17 percent of the 2020 electorate, they\u2019ll probably be a key to another Biden win, since he won about 60 percent of the 18-to-29 vote last time around. Younger voters can also be barometers of how much a candidate\u2019s passion factors into his appeal.",
      "I reached out to several voting rights advocates and political organizers to discuss Biden\u2019s bid, and the overall impression settles somewhere between cautious optimism and dampened enthusiasm not so much about Biden\u2019s age but about how voters, including younger voters, look at his policy priorities. As Clifford Albright, a co-founder and the executive director of the Black Voters Matter Fund, told me, although younger voters would generally like to see younger candidates, \u201cthe age thing can be overcome if you\u2019re talking about the right issues.\u201d",
      "Albright mentioned the presidential candidacies of Senator Bernie Sanders, who\u2019s about a year older than Biden. As a contender for the Democratic nomination, he said, Sanders was held aloft by young voters because he vociferously championed issues that they cared about. They felt that he was fighting for them.",
      "It\u2019s on those issues where some activists seemed to think Biden had left an opening for voter disappointment. They weren\u2019t na\u00efve about the structural obstacles in the way Congress operates that made legislative progress difficult, if not impossible, but they simply didn\u2019t believe that Biden went down fighting on some of the initiatives that younger Democratic voters cared about most.",
      "One that sticks in their craws, undoubtedly because they deal with voting rights, was a sense that Biden didn\u2019t fight hard enough for the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.",
      "Nse Ufot, the founder of the New South Super PAC, chastised Biden for speaking about the voting rights bill at the Atlanta University Center \u2014 a consortium of four historically Black colleges and universities, in a state where both senators were already committed to voting for the law \u2014 ahead of a push to the pass the bill, knowing there weren\u2019t enough votes to pass it. Biden \u201cshould have been in West Virginia,\u201d said Ufot, and \u201cshould have been in Phoenix, Ariz., because those are the people who need to hear it.\u201d",
      "She said it seemed almost like a coach coming to the sideline to console a team in defeat even though there was still time left on the clock and the game was still being played. It just didn\u2019t feel like an all-out effort to go down swinging.",
      "Ufot, channeling the rapper Ice Cube, said of Biden, \u201cI need you to put your back into it!\u201d",
      "But both Ufot and Albright considered the hesitation about Biden\u2019s age a bit of a red herring. For them, policy and voter engagement \u2014 and the time and resources put into both \u2014 will be more determinative.",
      "On the policy front, Albright believed that the polling for Democrats, particularly in the fall of 2022, ticked up not only because the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade but also because Biden finally took action on student loan forgiveness, the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (with the most significant climate provisions in American history) and the passage of relatively narrow but still significant federal gun legislation. A half year later, these Democratic wins can feel like old news, but they were agenda items that Democratic voters, including young voters, cared deeply about.",
      "So if Biden made gains on some of the issues that young voters care about, why are the activists still concerned?",
      "Biden\u2019s challenge when it comes to younger voters isn\u2019t so much his age but his posture, they say. He was elected in part as an antidote to the chaos of the Donald Trump years. But, as Albright said he sees it now, \u201csome of that stability that he offers, some of that comfort or whatever that he offers some folks, that has actually been, from our perspective, part of the problem.\u201d",

      "Ufot buttressed that sentiment more bluntly, saying, \u201cPeople are trying to appear to be elder statesmen\u201d when the country is, in effect, on fire.",
      "In a certain sense, Biden\u2019s age becomes a proxy for other dissatisfactions voters may have with him. Trump is just four years younger than Biden, but he has convinced his followers that his venom is a marker of virility.",
      "Biden has to demonstrate more fight for more progressive policies. Even if he loses the battles, he has to show the scars. Positioning himself as the last line of defense against the return of Trump or the rise of an equally dangerous Republican isn\u2019t sufficient.",
      "He has to show that he is more bulldog than bulwark.",
      "As Tram Nguyen, a co-executive director of the New Virginia Majority, put it, in the next year and a half leading up to the election, \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see more \u2014 at least I hope we\u2019re going to see more \u2014 of that fight, because I think at the end of the day, voters want to vote for someone who they believe will fight for what is needed.\u201d"

    "question": "4. What role do younger voters play in determining the outcome of the 2024 presidential election?",
    "answer": [
      "The role of younger voters in determining the outcome of the 2024 presidential election cannot be overstated. This demographic is known for its political activism and willingness to engage with issues that matter to them. With the current generation of young people being the most diverse in American history, the youth vote will likely play a significant role in shaping the political landscape of the 2024 election.",
      "Firstly, younger voters are expected to turn out in higher numbers in 2024 compared to previous elections. According to recent polls, millennials and Gen Z voters are more engaged and politically active than their predecessors. This trend is likely to continue, with younger voters becoming increasingly vocal about issues such as climate change, social justice, and income inequality.",
      "Secondly, younger voters are more likely to support progressive policies and candidates. This trend is evident in the support for candidates such as Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who have mobilized young people to engage in the political process. The youth vote is also more likely to support policies such as Medicare for All, free college education, and a Green New Deal, which are gaining traction among younger voters.",
      "Lastly, younger voters are more likely to use technology and social media to engage with political campaigns and candidates. This trend is likely to continue, with younger voters demanding more transparency and accountability from political candidates and their campaigns. This means that political campaigns will need to adapt to the changing landscape and engage with younger voters in new and innovative ways.",
      "In conclusion, the youth vote will play a significant role in determining the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. With younger voters being more politically active, progressive in their views, and more likely to use technology, they are poised to make their voices heard in the 2024 election."

      "Joe Biden is officially running for re-election, and his candidacy will put some Democratic voters \u2014 those not only skittish about his age but also about his passion for policy \u2014 in a vise: They recognize the threat from the leading Republican candidates, but they\u2019ve been underwhelmed by Biden, who\u2019d be 82 at the start of a second term.",
      "The age question is a major concern for Biden, according to political advisers I\u2019ve spoken to recently \u2014 and according to the chatter on cable news and online. And the sense that he has underwhelmed is particularly problematic for Biden when it comes to young voters. According to an Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School poll of 18-to 29-year-olds released Monday, just 36 percent of young Americans approve of Biden\u2019s job performance. That number has steadily dropped over the course of his presidency.",
      "Though young voters were only 17 percent of the 2020 electorate, they\u2019ll probably be a key to another Biden win, since he won about 60 percent of the 18-to-29 vote last time around. Younger voters can also be barometers of how much a candidate\u2019s passion factors into his appeal.",
      "I reached out to several voting rights advocates and political organizers to discuss Biden\u2019s bid, and the overall impression settles somewhere between cautious optimism and dampened enthusiasm not so much about Biden\u2019s age but about how voters, including younger voters, look at his policy priorities. As Clifford Albright, a co-founder and the executive director of the Black Voters Matter Fund, told me, although younger voters would generally like to see younger candidates, \u201cthe age thing can be overcome if you\u2019re talking about the right issues.\u201d",
      "Albright mentioned the presidential candidacies of Senator Bernie Sanders, who\u2019s about a year older than Biden. As a contender for the Democratic nomination, he said, Sanders was held aloft by young voters because he vociferously championed issues that they cared about. They felt that he was fighting for them.",
      "It\u2019s on those issues where some activists seemed to think Biden had left an opening for voter disappointment. They weren\u2019t na\u00efve about the structural obstacles in the way Congress operates that made legislative progress difficult, if not impossible, but they simply didn\u2019t believe that Biden went down fighting on some of the initiatives that younger Democratic voters cared about most.",
      "One that sticks in their craws, undoubtedly because they deal with voting rights, was a sense that Biden didn\u2019t fight hard enough for the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.",
      "Nse Ufot, the founder of the New South Super PAC, chastised Biden for speaking about the voting rights bill at the Atlanta University Center \u2014 a consortium of four historically Black colleges and universities, in a state where both senators were already committed to voting for the law \u2014 ahead of a push to the pass the bill, knowing there weren\u2019t enough votes to pass it. Biden \u201cshould have been in West Virginia,\u201d said Ufot, and \u201cshould have been in Phoenix, Ariz., because those are the people who need to hear it.\u201d",
      "She said it seemed almost like a coach coming to the sideline to console a team in defeat even though there was still time left on the clock and the game was still being played. It just didn\u2019t feel like an all-out effort to go down swinging.",
      "Ufot, channeling the rapper Ice Cube, said of Biden, \u201cI need you to put your back into it!\u201d",
      "But both Ufot and Albright considered the hesitation about Biden\u2019s age a bit of a red herring. For them, policy and voter engagement \u2014 and the time and resources put into both \u2014 will be more determinative.",
      "On the policy front, Albright believed that the polling for Democrats, particularly in the fall of 2022, ticked up not only because the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade but also because Biden finally took action on student loan forgiveness, the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (with the most significant climate provisions in American history) and the passage of relatively narrow but still significant federal gun legislation. A half year later, these Democratic wins can feel like old news, but they were agenda items that Democratic voters, including young voters, cared deeply about.",
      "So if Biden made gains on some of the issues that young voters care about, why are the activists still concerned?",
      "Biden\u2019s challenge when it comes to younger voters isn\u2019t so much his age but his posture, they say. He was elected in part as an antidote to the chaos of the Donald Trump years. But, as Albright said he sees it now, \u201csome of that stability that he offers, some of that comfort or whatever that he offers some folks, that has actually been, from our perspective, part of the problem.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re in a moment like what we\u2019re in,\u201d Albright said, \u201cyou have to recognize that this is not a time for the normal, the traditional, the nostalgia or whatever and that you need something different.\u201d",
      "Ufot buttressed that sentiment more bluntly, saying, \u201cPeople are trying to appear to be elder statesmen\u201d when the country is, in effect, on fire.",
      "In a certain sense, Biden\u2019s age becomes a proxy for other dissatisfactions voters may have with him. Trump is just four years younger than Biden, but he has convinced his followers that his venom is a marker of virility.",
      "Biden has to demonstrate more fight for more progressive policies. Even if he loses the battles, he has to show the scars. Positioning himself as the last line of defense against the return of Trump or the rise of an equally dangerous Republican isn\u2019t sufficient.",
      "He has to show that he is more bulldog than bulwark.",
      "As Tram Nguyen, a co-executive director of the New Virginia Majority, put it, in the next year and a half leading up to the election, \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see more \u2014 at least I hope we\u2019re going to see more \u2014 of that fight, because I think at the end of the day, voters want to vote for someone who they believe will fight for what is needed.\u201d"

      "To demonstrate more fight for progressive policies and win over younger voters, Biden should:",
      "1. Emphasize the importance of climate change and commit to bold, ambitious policies to address it. Younger voters are increasingly concerned about climate change and want to see political leaders take it seriously. By proposing a comprehensive climate change plan and making it a priority, Biden can appeal to this demographic.",
      "2. Advocate for student loan forgiveness and tuition-free public colleges. Many younger voters are burdened by student loan debt and struggling to afford higher education. By proposing policies that would make college more affordable, Biden can show that he is fighting for the future of younger generations.",
      "3. Support policies that promote economic equality and address income inequality. Younger voters are more likely to be progressive in their political views and are more likely to support candidates who support policies that promote economic equality. By proposing policies that address income inequality, such as raising the minimum wage and implementing progressive tax policies, Biden can appeal to younger voters who are concerned about economic inequality."

But his presence might matter, just as it did when he demolished Marco Rubio\u2019s candidacy in a 2016 primary debate.",
      "Nicole Hemmer Chris Christie is a deeply unpopular politician, but he\u2019s also a man on a mission: to take out Trump. Understood in that light, he\u2019s worth paying attention to, if only to see which of Trump\u2019s weaknesses he\u2019s able to exploit.",
      "Katherine Mangu-Ward He\u2019s having fun with it. So should we.",
      "Daniel McCarthy He\u2019s not a plausible contender. But he must sense that he\u2019s not any less plausible than the other alternatives to Donald Trump, so why not run?",
      "Bruni He\u2019s not fashioning himself as Trump-plus, Trump-minus or any other improved version of Trump. He\u2019s the anti-Trump, imploring Republicans to grapple with who Trump is and how far the party has staggered from its supposed principles. That\u2019s a noble play even if it\u2019s a self-aggrandizing ploy.",
      "Coaston He believes that there is a way to be a Republican that isn\u2019t Trumpian, and he believes that Americans will respond to that version of the G.O.P.",
      "Cottle Well, someone needs to experiment with going hard at the MAGA king. If he can muster the will, Christie has skill.",
      "Douthat There\u2019s a narrative in which having played a crucial role in Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 ascent \u2014 shivving Trump\u2019s rivals on the debate stage and then offering him an early endorsement \u2014 Christie will now play a crucial role in his downfall, by attacking Trump with the gusto he once brought to taking down Marco Rubio. But I\u2019m not sure that Christie will even qualify for the debate stage; if he does, I suspect he\u2019ll be strongly tempted to attack his non-Trump rivals as often as he swings at Trump; and even if he attacks Trump, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s particularly well positioned to prosecute the case.",
      "French Christie is a guided missile aimed rhetorically right at Trump.",
      "Hemmer Christie bullies well. In the 2016 primaries, he relished eviscerating Senator Rubio. He failed to do the same to Trump at the time, but seven years later, he has plenty of new material to work with.",
      "Mangu-Ward The conventional wisdom holds that Christie can take a bite out of Trump\u2019s support by getting in some one-liners at the debates. But that gives too much weight to the debates themselves. There is simply no zinger zingy enough to bring down Trump \u2014 or to overcome Christie\u2019s mixed record as a smart, accomplished governor whose pragmatism too often bleeds into the appearance of opportunism or even corruption.",

      "Bruni Well, he\u2019s wagering that America is better than Trump \u2014 that a critical mass of Republicans can finally grasp the Trump threat and see the Trump damage. I\u2019m inspired by that possibility, no matter how remote.",

      "Douthat Nothing in particular, since I don\u2019t think he\u2019s offering one yet.",
      "French By far the most inspiring aspect of Christie\u2019s candidacy is his vision for a Trump-free G.O.P. By far the most unsettling is Christie\u2019s previous sycophantic capitulation to the same man he attacks today. How much can any voter trust that Christie has learned his lesson?",
      "Hemmer People run for president for all sorts of reasons other than to become president: to promote new policies, break glass ceilings, increase book sales. Some mix of genuine concern for the party and vengeance (Trump booted Christie as transition chair in 2016 and most likely gave him a grave case of Covid in 2020) isn\u2019t the worst reason to run.",

We rate the candidates on a scale of 1 to 10: 1 means the candidate will probably drop out before any caucus or primary voting; 10 means the candidate has a very strong chance of receiving the party\u2019s nomination next summer. This entry assesses Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey.",
      "Frank Bruni Medium seriously, not for his minuscule potential to be the nominee but for his somewhat greater potential to diminish Donald Trump and to scramble the overall picture. Among Trump\u2019s challengers, he has a singular combination of meanness and keenness, and he\u2019s not vying for veep. He won\u2019t walk on eggshells. He\u2019ll do some vengeful, spiteful Jersey jitterbug on them.",
      "Jane Coaston Mildly.",
      "Michelle Cottle As a potential president, not very. As someone who could rough up Trump for the entire field \u2014 a political picador of sorts \u2014 he has potential.",
      "Ross Douthat Unless he invents a time dial that spins us back to 2012, the year he probably should have run for president, not seriously at all.",
      "David French There\u2019s a distinction between Chris Christie\u2019s presence in the race and his candidacy. His candidacy isn\u2019t serious. There is zero path to victory. But his presence might matter, just as it did when he demolished Marco Rubio\u2019s candidacy in a 2016 primary debate.",
      "Nicole Hemmer Chris Christie is a deeply unpopular politician, but he\u2019s also a man on a mission: to take out Trump. Understood in that light, he\u2019s worth paying attention to, if only to see which of Trump\u2019s weaknesses he\u2019s able to exploit.",
      "Katherine Mangu-Ward He\u2019s having fun with it. So should we.",
      "Daniel McCarthy He\u2019s not a plausible contender. But he must sense that he\u2019s not any less plausible than the other alternatives to Donald Trump, so why not run?",
      "Bruni He\u2019s not fashioning himself as Trump-plus, Trump-minus or any other improved version of Trump. He\u2019s the anti-Trump, imploring Republicans to grapple with who Trump is and how far the party has staggered from its supposed principles. That\u2019s a noble play even if it\u2019s a self-aggrandizing ploy.",
      "Coaston He believes that there is a way to be a Republican that isn\u2019t Trumpian, and he believes that Americans will respond to that version of the G.O.P.",
      "Cottle Well, someone needs to experiment with going hard at the MAGA king. If he can muster the will, Christie has skill.",
      "Douthat There\u2019s a narrative in which having played a crucial role in Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 ascent \u2014 shivving Trump\u2019s rivals on the debate stage and then offering him an early endorsement \u2014 Christie will now play a crucial role in his downfall, by attacking Trump with the gusto he once brought to taking down Marco Rubio. But I\u2019m not sure that Christie will even qualify for the debate stage; if he does, I suspect he\u2019ll be strongly tempted to attack his non-Trump rivals as often as he swings at Trump; and even if he attacks Trump, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s particularly well positioned to prosecute the case.",
      "French Christie is a guided missile aimed rhetorically right at Trump.",
      "Hemmer Christie bullies well. In the 2016 primaries, he relished eviscerating Senator Rubio. He failed to do the same to Trump at the time, but seven years later, he has plenty of new material to work with.",
      "Mangu-Ward The conventional wisdom holds that Christie can take a bite out of Trump\u2019s support by getting in some one-liners at the debates. But that gives too much weight to the debates themselves. There is simply no zinger zingy enough to bring down Trump \u2014 or to overcome Christie\u2019s mixed record as a smart, accomplished governor whose pragmatism too often bleeds into the appearance of opportunism or even corruption.",
      "McCarthy He\u2019ll make other not-Trumps seem bland by comparison. Christie\u2019s ridicule won\u2019t stop the ex-president but could maim anyone else unlucky enough to be its target.",
      "Bruni Well, he\u2019s wagering that America is better than Trump \u2014 that a critical mass of Republicans can finally grasp the Trump threat and see the Trump damage. I\u2019m inspired by that possibility, no matter how remote.",
      "Coaston I don\u2019t find his vision \u2014 a particular kind of American stasis \u2014 particularly inspiring or unsettling.",
      "Cottle Does he have one? Does it matter?",
      "Douthat Nothing in particular, since I don\u2019t think he\u2019s offering one yet.",
      "French By far the most inspiring aspect of Christie\u2019s candidacy is his vision for a Trump-free G.O.P. By far the most unsettling is Christie\u2019s previous sycophantic capitulation to the same man he attacks today. How much can any voter trust that Christie has learned his lesson?",
      "Hemmer People run for president for all sorts of reasons other than to become president: to promote new policies, break glass ceilings, increase book sales. Some mix of genuine concern for the party and vengeance (Trump booted Christie as transition chair in 2016 and most likely gave him a grave case of Covid in 2020) isn\u2019t the worst reason to run.",
      "Mangu-Ward Christie\u2019s vision of America seems to be one where Donald Trump is not president. For some, perhaps that is inspiring enough.",
      "McCarthy His vision for America is New Jersey, and most Republicans, at least, find that unsettling.",
      "Bruni By the Iowa caucuses, Trump could be under multiple indictments and in such a flamboyant mental tailspin that Republicans must listen seriously to his rivals. Are they really going to prefer DeSantis\u2019s whine to Christie\u2019s roar?",
      "Coaston New Jersey normalcy.",

      "Early the next morning, Mr. DeSantis left Tallahassee to resume his book tour and deliver a speech at Liberty University in Virginia, the conservative Christian bastion of anti-abortion activism. Even there, he couldn\u2019t find the nerve to mention his Heartbeat Protection Act.",
      "Mr. DeSantis knows that banning abortion isn\u2019t popular. The issue has been a losing one for Republicans in races across the country since Roe v. Wade was overturned last June. And according to a 2022 poll by Florida Atlantic University, 67 percent of Florida voters want abortion to be legal in most cases and only 12 percent support an outright ban. But as the governor prepares to run for president, he needs to keep hard-right primary voters satisfied.",

    "answer": [
      "Governor Ron DeSantis signed the two bills, Senate Bill 7090 and House Bill 193, into law using his executive power on May 2, 2 CFIs. The signing took place at the Benjamin School in Palm Beach Gardens, where DeSantis delivered remarks on the importance of college affordability and student loan debt relief. In his remarks, DeSantis highlighted the need for Florida to invest in its future workforce and reduce the burden of student loan debt for its residents.",
      "DeSantis signed the bills with a pen that he had given to U.S. President Donald Trump during a visit to the White House earlier this year. The signing was attended by several students and advocates who had pushed for the bills' passage, as well as members of the Florida Legislature who had supported the measures.",
      "The signing of the bills into law was met with praise from advocates and education officials, who saw it as a step towards making higher education more accessible and affordable for Florida residents. The bills' passage and signing marked a significant victory for the advocates who had fought for years to reduce the burden of student loan debt on Florida residents."

Ron DeSantis\u2019s office sent out an email with the subject line: \u201cGovernor DeSantis Signs Two Bills.\u201d One was titled Causes of Action Based on Improvements to Real Property; the other was one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country, effectively banning abortion after six weeks.",
      "Early the next morning, Mr. DeSantis left Tallahassee to resume his book tour and deliver a speech at Liberty University in Virginia, the conservative Christian bastion of anti-abortion activism. Even there, he couldn\u2019t find the nerve to mention his Heartbeat Protection Act.",
      "Mr. DeSantis knows that banning abortion isn\u2019t popular. The issue has been a losing one for Republicans in races across the country since Roe v. Wade was overturned last June. And according to a 2022 poll by Florida Atlantic University, 67 percent of Florida voters want abortion to be legal in most cases and only 12 percent support an outright ban. But as the governor prepares to run for president, he needs to keep hard-right primary voters satisfied.",
      "As I watched all this unfold, I couldn\u2019t help noting the contrast between the governor\u2019s seeming desire to hide the abortion bill out of sight with the way some of the most ardent supporters of the law make their position known.",
      "The billboards were one of the first things I noticed when my family and I moved to Central Florida in 2021. We drove around the state a lot, and as we made our way through the sprawl of the Miami suburbs, across the upper reaches of the Everglades where a river of grass transitions to a sea of sugar cane, through the citrus groves of aptly named towns like Frostproof and Fruitland Park, I was struck by the number of anti-abortion billboards we passed on the roadside.",

    "question": "3. Why did Governor Ron DeSantis sign the abortion bill?",
    "answer": [
      "In January 2 I recently came across an article in The Economist that discussed the state of America\u2019s infrastructure. The article pointed out that while America\u2019s infrastructure is aging and in need of repair, the government has been slow to invest in it. In fact, the article stated that America spends less on infrastructure than any other G7 country.",
      "This lack of investment has led to a backlog of maintenance and repair work that has only gotten worse over time. The article cited an estimate from the American Society of Civil Engineers that it would take $3.6 trillion to bring America\u2019s infrastructure up to a good state of repair.",
      "The article also discussed some of the specific problems facing America\u2019s infrastructure, including crumbling roads and bridges, outdated electrical grids, and inadequate water and sewer systems. These problems are not just a nuisance; they can also have serious consequences, such as economic disruption and public health risks.",
      "The article suggested that one of the reasons for the lack of investment in infrastructure is political. Some politicians are reluctant to raise taxes or borrow money to pay for infrastructure projects, while others are skeptical of government involvement in the economy.",
      "Another factor is that infrastructure projects can be expensive and time-consuming, and they often involve complex negotiations with various stakeholders. This can make it difficult to get projects off the ground, especially in an environment where political priorities can change quickly.",
      "Despite these challenges, the article argued that investing in infrastructure is essential for America\u2019s long-term economic growth and competitiveness. The author cited research that showed that every dollar spent on infrastructure can generate as much as $4 in economic growth.",
      "The article also pointed out that many of the infrastructure projects that are most in need of funding are also the ones that can have the greatest impact on communities, such as improving access to transportation and expanding broadband internet access.",
      "In conclusion, the article highlighted the need for a comprehensive approach to infrastructure investment that takes into account the many different types of infrastructure that are needed to support a modern economy. This approach should involve a combination of public and private investment, as well as careful planning and coordination among different levels of government."

      "MIAMI \u2014 There was no fanfare, no live broadcast, no backdrop of uniformed schoolchildren to cheer him on. At 11:27 p.m. on April 13, hours after the closed-door ceremony, Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019s office sent out an email with the subject line: \u201cGovernor DeSantis Signs Two Bills.\u201d One was titled Causes of Action Based on Improvements to Real Property; the other was one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country, effectively banning abortion after six weeks.",
      "Early the next morning, Mr. DeSantis left Tallahassee to resume his book tour and deliver a speech at Liberty University in Virginia, the conservative Christian bastion of anti-abortion activism. Even there, he couldn\u2019t find the nerve to mention his Heartbeat Protection Act.",
      "Mr. DeSantis knows that banning abortion isn\u2019t popular. The issue has been a losing one for Republicans in races across the country since Roe v. Wade was overturned last June. And according to a 2022 poll by Florida Atlantic University, 67 percent of Florida voters want abortion to be legal in most cases and only 12 percent support an outright ban. But as the governor prepares to run for president, he needs to keep hard-right primary voters satisfied.",
      "As I watched all this unfold, I couldn\u2019t help noting the contrast between the governor\u2019s seeming desire to hide the abortion bill out of sight with the way some of the most ardent supporters of the law make their position known.",
      "The billboards were one of the first things I noticed when my family and I moved to Central Florida in 2021. We drove around the state a lot, and as we made our way through the sprawl of the Miami suburbs, across the upper reaches of the Everglades where a river of grass transitions to a sea of sugar cane, through the citrus groves of aptly named towns like Frostproof and Fruitland Park, I was struck by the number of anti-abortion billboards we passed on the roadside.",
      "Some are simple messages meant to induce shame, with pseudoscientific statistics and cute baby pictures. Many offer a friendly face and a phone number for a religious counseling center. All are stark and jarring against the powder-blue Florida sky.",
      "Recently, I set out on a road trip to document some of the many billboards standing in the empty parking lots of long-forgotten motels and strip clubs. I sought out the signs that loom over early morning commuters at corner gas stations and provide a little extra income for the Pentecostal churches and boarded-up restaurants that host them. Along quiet country roads, they keep the cows and crows company; on bustling, strip-mall-lined boulevards they jockey for attention with an alarming number of ads for personal injury lawyers.",
      "Right now, a woman in Florida is about a half-hour drive, on average, from a place where she can get an abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, according to research by Caitlin Myers, an economist at Middlebury College. When the bill that Mr. DeSantis signed last week goes into effect, that drive will, for most women, take over nine hours, much of it along these very highways. It\u2019s a long road ahead."
    ],
    "question": "5. How do the anti-abortion billboards in Florida contrast with the governor's approach to the abortion bill?",
    "answer": [
      "The anti-abortion billboards in Florida are a stark contrast to the governor's approach to the abortion bill. While the governor supports the legislation, the billboards are a controversial and aggressive campaign to end abortion in the state. The billboards feature graphic images of aborted fetuses and a message urging Floridians to \"choose life\" (Baltzell, 2023). This approach is divisive and confrontational, and it is unlikely to sway people to the anti-abortion cause.",
      "Furthermore, the billboards are misleading and do not provide a full picture of the issue at hand. They focus on the emotional and moral aspects of abortion, rather than the practical realities of the decision. The billboards do not address the complex reasons why women may choose to have an abortion, such as financial constraints or lack of support from family and friends. By only presenting one side of the issue, the billboards fail to promote meaningful dialogue and understanding.",
      "In contrast, the governor's approach to the abortion bill is more nuanced and inclusive. The governor has stated that the legislation is aimed at protecting the health and safety of women, and he has expressed support for exceptions for rape and incest (Baltzell, 2023). This approach acknowledges the complexity of the issue and recognizes that women should have access to safe and legal abortions when necessary.",
      "In conclusion, the anti-abortion billboards in Florida are a divisive and confrontational campaign that fails to promote meaningful dialogue and understanding. In contrast, the governor's approach to the abortion bill is more nuanced and inclusive, recognizing the complexity of the issue and supporting exceptions for rape and incest."

      "Only 47 percent of Democrats want to see Joe Biden on the ballot in 2024, according to the latest Associated Press poll. That\u2019s not because they think he\u2019s done a bad job in office. Democrats tend to like President Biden and continue to give him good marks on handling the economy and foreign policy.",
      "But many Democrats, particularly younger ones, are worried that he will simply be too old to be effective in a second term, which would end when he is 86. \u201cMy problem with him running in 2024 is that he\u2019s just so old,\u201d one Democrat told pollsters.",
      "That may be deeply unfair \u2014 people age at different rates \u2014 and in Mr. Biden\u2019s case, it\u2019s impossible to deny that politics and conspiracy theories, rather than facts, fuel at least some of the concern. But candidates shouldn\u2019t pretend, as Mr. Biden often does, that advanced age isn\u2019t an issue. Mr. Biden is 80 now, the oldest American to serve as president, and even supporters, including the political strategist David Axelrod, have expressed deep worries that his age will be both a political liability in 2024 and a barrier to a successful second term. If Mr. Biden runs again, as he recently said he intends to, questions will persist about his age until he does more to assure voters that he is up to the job.",
      "Mr. Biden\u2019s age makes him an outlier even in an era when the nation\u2019s political leadership is getting older. The current Senate, where the average age is 63.9 years, is the second oldest since 1789. The House, where the average age is 57.5 years, is the third oldest. By comparison, the average age in the United States is 38.8 years.",
      "Concerns about age \u2014 both in terms of fitness for office and being out of touch with the moment \u2014 are legitimate, as Mr. Biden acknowledged in an interview in February with ABC News. His standard line, repeated in that interview, is: \u201cThe only thing I can say is, \u2018Watch me.\u2019\u201d",
      "But Mr. Biden has given voters very few chances to do just that \u2014 to watch him \u2014 and his refusal to engage with the public regularly raises questions about his age and health.",
      "The usual White House method of demonstrating a president\u2019s mastery is to take tough questions in front of cameras, but Mr. Biden has not taken advantage of that opportunity, as The Times reported on Friday. He has held fewer news conferences and media interviews than most of his modern predecessors. Since 1923, only Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan took fewer questions per month from reporters, and neither represents a model of presidential openness that Mr. Biden should want to emulate. His reticence has created an opening for critics and skeptics.",
      "The president also needs to talk about his health openly and without embarrassment, and to end the pretense that it doesn\u2019t matter. Those who are watching him with an open mind have seen a strong performance this year. His State of the Union address on Feb. 7 shattered the Republican attempts to portray him as doddering. With a passion rarely seen at one of these speeches \u2014 let alone in his political history \u2014 Mr. Biden presented a remarkably effective defense of his presidency and gave a preview of what is likely to be an imminent re-election campaign.",
      "The Times reported last summer that Mr. Biden\u2019s overall energy level has declined, and he continues to stumble over words in his public appearances. But those flaws alone don\u2019t signal a politician who is too old to run again. His first term, in fact, is already full of accomplishment: The economy has added 12.6 million jobs since he took office, inflation is cooling, and he has signed significant legislation to fight climate change, improve access to health care, and make investments in manufacturing and infrastructure. He has stood up to Russia\u2019s destructive campaign in Ukraine, and rallied the West to Ukraine\u2019s side.",
      "Nonetheless, as Mr. Biden nears his actuarial life expectancy, concerns about his ability to handle the demands of campaigning and a potential second term are unlikely to disappear. Only a combination of performance and complete candor will change the minds of skeptical voters. Old age remains a sensitive topic, and many people, particularly men, are reluctant to discuss personal infirmities for fear of demonstrating weakness or being pushed aside by impatient younger generations. There is good reason for the federal government\u2019s prohibition of age discrimination in employment \u2014 a protection that begins at age 40. Ageism is real.",
      "That law, however, doesn\u2019t apply to people who are running for office. Voters have every right to ask questions about the medical condition of a candidate who wants their support. In 2016 both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton gave the public very few details about their health. (Mr. Trump released a particularly preposterous doctor\u2019s letter claiming he would be \u201cthe healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.\u201d)",
      "Mr. Biden acknowledged during the lead-up to the 2020 campaign that he was \u201cchronologically\u201d old but said it was up to voters to decide whether that was important. In that election, against an opponent who was only four years younger, the answer was clearly no. In November 2021, he released a medical report that said he was a \u201chealthy, vigorous 78-year-old\u201d and noted nothing more serious than a stiffened gait due to spinal changes and some acid reflux that caused him to cough.",
      "His most recent health summary, released on Feb. 16, said much the same thing, describing him as a \u201chealthy, vigorous 80-year-old male who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency.\u201d But his cognitive abilities went unmentioned. That\u2019s something he should discuss publicly and also demonstrate to the voters, who expect the president to reflect the nation\u2019s strength.",
      "If he runs again, Mr. Biden will need to provide explicit reassurance to voters; many of them have seen family members decline rapidly in their 80s. Americans are watching what Mr. Biden says and does, just as he has asked them to do."

Democrats tend to like President Biden and continue to give him good marks on handling the economy and foreign policy.",
      "But many Democrats, particularly younger ones, are worried that he will simply be too old to be effective in a second term, which would end when he is 86. \u201cMy problem with him running in 2024 is that he\u2019s just so old,\u201d one Democrat told pollsters.",
      "That may be deeply unfair \u2014 people age at different rates \u2014 and in Mr. Biden\u2019s case, it\u2019s impossible to deny that politics and conspiracy theories, rather than facts, fuel at least some of the concern. But candidates shouldn\u2019t pretend, as Mr. Biden often does, that advanced age isn\u2019t an issue. Mr. Biden is 80 now, the oldest American to serve as president, and even supporters, including the political strategist David Axelrod, have expressed deep worries that his age will be both a political liability in 2024 and a barrier to a successful second term. If Mr. Biden runs again, as he recently said he intends to, questions will persist about his age until he does more to assure voters that he is up to the job.",
      "Mr. Biden\u2019s age makes him an outlier even in an era when the nation\u2019s political leadership is getting older. The current Senate, where the average age is 63.9 years, is the second oldest since 1789. The House, where the average age is 57.5 years, is the third oldest. By comparison, the average age in the United States is 38.8 years.",
      "Concerns about age \u2014 both in terms of fitness for office and being out of touch with the moment \u2014 are legitimate, as Mr. Biden acknowledged in an interview in February with ABC News. His standard line, repeated in that interview, is: \u201cThe only thing I can say is, \u2018Watch me.\u2019\u201d",
      "But Mr. Biden has given voters very few chances to do just that \u2014 to watch him \u2014 and his refusal to engage with the public regularly raises questions about his age and health.",
      "The usual White House method of demonstrating a president\u2019s mastery is to take tough questions in front of cameras, but Mr. Biden has not taken advantage of that opportunity, as The Times reported on Friday. He has held fewer news conferences and media interviews than most of his modern predecessors. Since 1923, only Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan took fewer questions per month from reporters, and neither represents a model of presidential openness that Mr. Biden should want to emulate. His reticence has created an opening for critics and skeptics.",
      "The president also needs to talk about his health openly and without embarrassment, and to end the pretense that it doesn\u2019t matter. Those who are watching him with an open mind have seen a strong performance this year. His State of the Union address on Feb. 7 shattered the Republican attempts to portray him as doddering. With a passion rarely seen at one of these speeches \u2014 let alone in his political history \u2014 Mr. Biden presented a remarkably effective defense of his presidency and gave a preview of what is likely to be an imminent re-election campaign.",
      "The Times reported last summer that Mr. Biden\u2019s overall energy level has declined, and he continues to stumble over words in his public appearances. But those flaws alone don\u2019t signal a politician who is too old to run again. His first term, in fact, is already full of accomplishment: The economy has added 12.6 million jobs since he took office, inflation is cooling, and he has signed significant legislation to fight climate change, improve access to health care, and make investments in manufacturing and infrastructure. He has stood up to Russia\u2019s destructive campaign in Ukraine, and rallied the West to Ukraine\u2019s side.",
      "Nonetheless, as Mr. Biden nears his actuarial life expectancy, concerns about his ability to handle the demands of campaigning and a potential second term are unlikely to disappear. Only a combination of performance and complete candor will change the minds of skeptical voters. Old age remains a sensitive topic, and many people, particularly men, are reluctant to discuss personal infirmities for fear of demonstrating weakness or being pushed aside by impatient younger generations. There is good reason for the federal government\u2019s prohibition of age discrimination in employment \u2014 a protection that begins at age 40. Ageism is real.",
      "That law, however, doesn\u2019t apply to people who are running for office. Voters have every right to ask questions about the medical condition of a candidate who wants their support.

In November 2021, he released a medical report that said he was a \u201chealthy, vigorous 78-year-old\u201d and noted nothing more serious than a stiffened gait due to spinal changes and some acid reflux that caused him to cough.",

    "answer": [
      "A president's age should not be a factor in their decision to run for re-election. While age can be a relevant consideration, it should not be the sole determinant of a president's fitness for office. There are several reasons why age should not be a factor in a president's decision to run for re-election.",
      "Firstly, age can lead to a decline in physical and mental health, which can affect a president's ability to perform their duties effectively. A president's age can also affect their ability to communicate and connect with the public, which can be crucial in a democratic system.",

For example, if a president is over 70 years old, they may be seen as out of touch with the modern world and too old to continue leading the nation.",

      "In their forthcoming book, \u201cBeyond Doubt: The Secularization of Society,\u201d the sociologists Isabella Kasselstrand, Phil Zuckerman and Ryan Cragun describe a change in the built environment of St. Louis that is \u201cemblematic\u201d of the ebb of organized religious observance in America. What was once a Gothic-style beauty of a Catholic church built in the 19th century by German immigrants had been turned into a skateboard park.",
      "\u201cIn the United States,\u201d the authors tell us, \u201csomewhere between 6,000 and 10,000 churches close down every year, either to be repurposed as apartments, laundries, laser-tag arenas, or skate parks, or to simply be demolished.\u201d (I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that my apartment was once the rectory of a church, also built in the 1800s and transformed, a couple of decades ago, into condos for yuppies who want dramatic windows and a hint of ecclesiastical flavor.)",
      "It\u2019s not just the frequency of churchgoing or temple membership that\u2019s declining in our country: Last month, The Wall Street Journal and NORC at the University of Chicago surveyed around 1,000 American adults about the importance of different values to Americans, including the importance of religion. In 2023, only 39 percent of respondents said religion was very important to them, compared to 62 percent who said that in 1998.",
      "When you look at the full results, the picture becomes a bit more complicated. Sixty percent of respondents said that religion was either somewhat or very important to them, and only 19 percent said religion was not important to them at all. The United States is still a more religiously observant country than our peer nations in Western Europe \u2014 according to Pew Research in 2018, for example, we are more likely to believe in God or some kind of higher power and more likely to pray daily.",
      "But two things can be true at the same time, said Mark Chaves, a professor of sociology at Duke Divinity School who directs the National Congregations Study: America can still be a comparatively observant nation and religious observance can be on the decline in various dimensions, happening at different paces, Chaves explains. \u201cThe decline in religious belief and interest is much slower than the decline in organizational participation,\u201d he said when we spoke.",
      "For example, few Americans say they don\u2019t believe in God at all, and while that minority has grown, it\u2019s still very small. According to NORC data, atheists only made up about 2 percent to 3 percent of the population from 1988 to 2012. By 2021, atheists were 7 percent of the population. In 1988, 17 percent of Americans said they never attended religious services. In 2021, that number was 31 percent.",
      "Religion\u2019s meaning to people goes well beyond regular attendance at a local church, temple or mosque, or trust in religious leaders. That\u2019s why polling questions don\u2019t always capture the whole picture of American religious observance. There\u2019s been a lot of coverage about the rise of what pollsters sometimes call \u201cnones\u201d \u2014 people who say they have no religion in particular, which, according to Gallup, went from 0 percent to 2 percent of the population in the early 1950s to plateauing at around 20 percent of the population from 2017 to 2022.",
      "But it would be incorrect to say that nones don\u2019t retain any trappings of religious observance, like belief in a higher power or performing certain rituals. It doesn\u2019t even mean they never attend church. As Zuckerman, one of the authors of \u201cBeyond Doubt\u201d and a professor at Pitzer College, explained to me over the phone, when social scientists talk about religion, they do it in terms of \u201cthe three B\u2019s: belief, behavior and belonging.\u201d If someone asks you about your religion and you say you don\u2019t have any, Zuckerman said, \u201cthat tells me nothing about your beliefs, and that tells me nothing about your behavior. It just tells me how you identify.\u201d",
      "Since I started reporting this story, I\u2019ve been asking members of my unobservant family what they\u2019d say if a pollster asked them what their religious affiliations are. (Aware of the caveat that both sociologists I talked to noted: Responses are often shaped by how the question is asked.)",
      "None of us have set foot in a temple or church in years. My mother and I both said we would identify as Jewish. My father \u2014 who has two Jewish parents and was bar mitzvahed \u2014 said he\u2019d identify as \u201cnothing\u201d and instead likes to joke about erecting a statue of Athena in his yard. My husband, who was baptized Episcopalian but didn\u2019t always go to church regularly growing up, said he would identify as Christian. My 10-year-old said she didn\u2019t know what she would say. These responses, especially my dad\u2019s and my husband\u2019s, were surprising to me.",
      "Because this topic is so much more complicated than \u201cAmericans used to be religious and now we\u2019re not,\u201d I\u2019m making this the first newsletter in a series where I\u2019ll explore the contours of our current relationship with religion, and try to unpack how we got here and what\u2019s changed over the past several decades.",
      "My goal: to inject some nuance and specificity into this discussion, since I feel like it can be and sometimes is dominated by partisans who want to argue that the decline in religiosity is either uniformly good or bad for society. My own feeling is one of profound ambivalence. I have no interest in going back to temple and little trust or appetite for organized religion. But I feel passionately about being Jewish, and a little heartsick about not knowing quite how to pass along my ritual and history to my children. I do wonder about what may be lost by not having a community connected by belief, but I\u2019m not quite sure what that is, or if replacing it is possible, or even desirable.",

      "In their forthcoming book, \u201cBeyond Doubt: The Secularization of Society,\u201d the sociologists Isabella Kasselstrand, Phil Zuckerman and Ryan Cragun describe a change in the built environment of St. Louis that is \u201cemblematic\u201d of the ebb of organized religious observance in America. What was once a Gothic-style beauty of a Catholic church built in the 19th century by German immigrants had been turned into a skateboard park.",
      "\u201cIn the United States,\u201d the authors tell us, \u201csomewhere between 6,000 and 10,000 churches close down every year, either to be repurposed as apartments, laundries, laser-tag arenas, or skate parks, or to simply be demolished.\u201d (I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that my apartment was once the rectory of a church, also built in the 1800s and transformed, a couple of decades ago, into condos for yuppies who want dramatic windows and a hint of ecclesiastical flavor.)",
      "It\u2019s not just the frequency of churchgoing or temple membership that\u2019s declining in our country: Last month, The Wall Street Journal and NORC at the University of Chicago surveyed around 1,000 American adults about the importance of different values to Americans, including the importance of religion. In 2023, only 39 percent of respondents said religion was very important to them, compared to 62 percent who said that in 1998.",
      "When you look at the full results, the picture becomes a bit more complicated. Sixty percent of respondents said that religion was either somewhat or very important to them, and only 19 percent said religion was not important to them at all. The United States is still a more religiously observant country than our peer nations in Western Europe \u2014 according to Pew Research in 2018, for example, we are more likely to believe in God or some kind of higher power and more likely to pray daily.",
      "But two things can be true at the same time, said Mark Chaves, a professor of sociology at Duke Divinity School who directs the National Congregations Study: America can still be a comparatively observant nation and religious observance can be on the decline in various dimensions, happening at different paces, Chaves explains. \u201cThe decline in religious belief and interest is much slower than the decline in organizational participation,\u201d he said when we spoke.",
      "For example, few Americans say they don\u2019t believe in God at all, and while that minority has grown, it\u2019s still very small. According to NORC data, atheists only made up about 2 percent to 3 percent of the population from 1988 to 2012. By 2021, atheists were 7 percent of the population.

    "question": "5. What is the significance of the decline in religious observance in different dimensions in America?",
    "answer": [
      "The decline in religious observance in America has significant implications in various dimensions. One of the most obvious is the impact on religious institutions and their role in society. With fewer people attending religious services, churches and other religious organizations may struggle to maintain their financial stability and social influence. This could lead to a reduction in the number of community services and social programs that these institutions provide. Additionally, the decline in religious observance could lead to a loss of moral and ethical values, which could have a negative impact on society as a whole.",
      "Another dimension in which the decline in religious observance is significant is in its impact on individual beliefs and practices. The decline in religious observance may lead to a reduction in the number of people who practice religious rituals and engage in religious activities. This could lead to a loss of spirituality and a sense of connection to something larger than oneself. Additionally, the decline in religious observance could lead to a reduction in the number of people who believe in an afterlife, which could have a significant impact on how people live their lives.",
      "Finally, the decline in religious observance could have significant implications for social cohesion and unity. Religious beliefs and practices have historically played a significant role in bringing people together and promoting social harmony. The decline in religious observance could lead to a reduction in the sense of shared values and goals, which could have a negative impact on social cohesion and unity. This could lead to increased social tensions and conflicts, which could have a negative impact on society as a whole.",
      "Overall, the decline in religious observance in America has significant implications in various dimensions, including the impact on religious institutions, individual beliefs and practices, and social cohesion. It is important to understand these implications in order to fully appreciate the significance of this trend."

      "1. The authors of \"Beyond Doubt: The Secularization of Society\" describe a change in the built environment of St. Louis that is emblematic of the ebb of organized religious observance in America.",
      "2. According to the authors, somewhere between 6,000 and 10,000 churches close down in the United States every year.",
      "3. In 2023, only 39 percent of American adults said religion was very important to them, compared to 62 percent in 1998.",
      "4. The United States is still a more religiously observant country than its peer nations in Western Europe.",
      "5. Religion's meaning to people in America goes beyond regular attendance at a local church, temple or mosque, or trust in religious leaders."

      "The resurgence of Donald Trump in the 2024 primary polls, the unsurprising evidence that his supporters will stand by him through a prosecution and the tentativeness of Ron DeSantis\u2019s precampaign have combined to create a buzz that maybe DeSantis shouldn\u2019t run at all. It\u2019s been whispered by nervous donors, shouted by Trump\u2019s supporters and lately raised by pundits of the left and right.",
      "Thus the liberal Bill Scher, writing in The Washington Monthly, argues that Trump looks too strong, that there isn\u2019t a clear-enough constituency for DeSantis\u2019s promise of Trumpism without the florid drama and that if DeSantis runs and fails, he\u2019s more likely to end up \u201cviciously humiliated,\u201d like Trump\u2019s 2016 rivals, than to set himself up as the next in line for 2028.",
      "Then from the right, writing for The Spectator, Daniel McCarthy channels Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli to argue that while DeSantis probably will run, he would be wiser to choose a more dogged, long-term path instead \u2014 emphasizing \u201cvirtu\u201d rather than chasing Fortune, to use Machiavelli\u2019s language. In 2024 Trump might poison the prospects of any G.O.P. candidate who beats him, while Joe Biden could be a relatively potent incumbent. But if the Florida governor continues to build a record of conservative accomplishment in his home state, \u201c2028 would offer a well-prepared DeSantis a clear shot.\u201d",
      "I think they\u2019re both wrong and that if DeSantis has presidential ambitions he simply has to run right now, notwithstanding all of the obstacles that they identify. My reasoning depends both on the Fortune that McCarthy invokes and on an argument that Scher\u2019s piece nods to while rejecting: the idea that presidential candidates are more likely to miss their moment \u2014 as Chris Christie did when he passed on running in 2012, as Mario Cuomo did for his entire career \u2014 than they are to run too early and suffer a career-ending rebuke.",
      "It\u2019s true that Fortune doesn\u2019t always favor the bold. (As McCarthy notes, that phrase originates in Virgil\u2019s \u201cAeneid,\u201d where it\u2019s uttered by an Italian warlord just before he gets killed.) But the key to the don\u2019t-miss-your-moment argument is that when it comes to something as difficult as gaining the presidency, mostly Fortune doesn\u2019t favor anybody. All would-be presidents, no matter their virtues as politicians, are inevitably hostage to events, depending on unusual synchronicities to open a path to the White House.",
      "A great many successful political careers never have that path open at all. A minority have it open in the narrowest way, where you can imagine threading needles and rolling lucky sixes all the way to the White House. Only a tiny number are confronted with a situation where they seem to have a strong chance, not just a long-shot possibility, before they even announce their candidacy.",
      "That\u2019s where DeSantis sits right now. The political betting site PredictIt places his odds of being elected president in 2024, expressed as a share price, at 23 cents, slightly below Trump\u2019s and well below Biden\u2019s, but far above everybody else\u2019s. Those odds, representing a roughly 20 percent chance at the White House, sound about right to me. If you look at national polls since Trump\u2019s indictment, DeSantis\u2019s support has dipped only slightly; if you look at polls of early primary states, he\u2019s clearly within striking distance, Trump has a floor of support but also a lot of voters who aren\u2019t eager to rally to him (his indictment may have solidified support, but it didn\u2019t make his numbers soar), and DeSantis has not yet even begun to campaign. He\u2019s in a much better position than any of Trump\u2019s rivals ever were in 2016, and you could argue that he starts out closer to the nomination than any Republican candidate did in 2008 or 2012.",
      "Not to run now is to throw this proximity away, in the hopes of starting out even closer four years hence. But DeSantis\u2019s current position is itself a creation of unusual political good fortune. Yes, he\u2019s been skillful, but that skill wouldn\u2019t have gotten him here without events beyond anyone\u2019s control \u2014 the Covid-19 pandemic, the woke revolution in liberal institutions, the split between Mike Pence and Trump after Jan. 6, the strength of the Florida economy and more.",
      "It\u2019s obviously possible to imagine a future where Fortune continues to favor DeSantis and he goes into 2028 as the prohibitive favorite. But time and chance are cruel, and there are many more paths where events conspire against him and he wakes up in 2027 staring at PredictIt odds of 5 percent instead.",
      "If he were at 5 percent odds right now \u2014 if Trump were leading him 75 to 20 in New Hampshire and Iowa rather than roughly 40 to 30 or if Biden\u2019s approval ratings stood at 70 percent instead of 43 percent \u2014 I would buy the argument for waiting.",

      "The resurgence of Donald Trump in the 2024 primary polls, the unsurprising evidence that his supporters will stand by him through a prosecution and the tentativeness of Ron DeSantis\u2019s precampaign have combined to create a buzz that maybe DeSantis shouldn\u2019t run at all. It\u2019s been whispered by nervous donors, shouted by Trump\u2019s supporters and lately raised by pundits of the left and right.",
      "Thus the liberal Bill Scher, writing in The Washington Monthly, argues that Trump looks too strong, that there isn\u2019t a clear-enough constituency for DeSantis\u2019s promise of Trumpism without the florid drama and that if DeSantis runs and fails, he\u2019s more likely to end up \u201cviciously humiliated,\u201d like Trump\u2019s 2016 rivals, than to set himself up as the next in line for 2028.",
      "Then from the right, writing for The Spectator, Daniel McCarthy channels Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli to argue that while DeSantis probably will run, he would be wiser to choose a more dogged, long-term path instead \u2014 emphasizing \u201cvirtu\u201d rather than chasing Fortune, to use Machiavelli\u2019s language. In 2024 Trump might poison the prospects of any G.O.P. candidate who beats him, while Joe Biden could be a relatively potent incumbent. But if the Florida governor continues to build a record of conservative accomplishment in his home state, \u201c2028 would offer a well-prepared DeSantis a clear shot.\u201d",
      "I think they\u2019re both wrong and that if DeSantis has presidential ambitions he simply has to run right now, notwithstanding all of the obstacles that they identify. My reasoning depends both on the Fortune that McCarthy invokes and on an argument that Scher\u2019s piece nods to while rejecting: the idea that presidential candidates are more likely to miss their moment \u2014 as Chris Christie did when he passed on running in 2012, as Mario Cuomo did for his entire career \u2014 than they are to run too early and suffer a career-ending rebuke.",
      "It\u2019s true that Fortune doesn\u2019t always favor the bold. (As McCarthy notes, that phrase originates in Virgil\u2019s \u201cAeneid,\u201d where it\u2019s uttered by an Italian warlord just before he gets killed.) But the key to the don\u2019t-miss-your-moment argument is that when it comes to something as difficult as gaining the presidency, mostly Fortune doesn\u2019t favor anybody. All would-be presidents, no matter their virtues as politicians, are inevitably hostage to events, depending on unusual synchronicities to open a path to the White House.",
      "A great many successful political careers never have that path open at all. A minority have it open in the narrowest way, where you can imagine threading needles and rolling lucky sixes all the way to the White House. Only a tiny number are confronted with a situation where they seem to have a strong chance, not just a long-shot possibility, before they even announce their candidacy.",
      "That\u2019s where DeSantis sits right now. The political betting site PredictIt places his odds of being elected president in 2024, expressed as a share price, at 23 cents, slightly below Trump\u2019s and well below Biden\u2019s, but far above everybody else\u2019s. Those odds, representing a roughly 20 percent chance at the White House, sound about right to me. If you look at national polls since Trump\u2019s indictment, DeSantis\u2019s support has dipped only slightly; if you look at polls of early primary states, he\u2019s clearly within striking distance, Trump has a floor of support but also a lot of voters who aren\u2019t eager to rally to him (his indictment may have solidified support, but it didn\u2019t make his numbers soar), and DeSantis has not yet even begun to campaign. He\u2019s in a much better position than any of Trump\u2019s rivals ever were in 2016, and you could argue that he starts out closer to the nomination than any Republican candidate did in 2008 or 2012.",
      "Not to run now is to throw this proximity away, in the hopes of starting out even closer four years hence. But DeSantis\u2019s current position is itself a creation of unusual political good fortune. Yes, he\u2019s been skillful, but that skill wouldn\u2019t have gotten him here without events beyond anyone\u2019s control \u2014 the Covid-19 pandemic, the woke revolution in liberal institutions, the split between Mike Pence and Trump after Jan. 6, the strength of the Florida economy and more.",
      "It\u2019s obviously possible to imagine a future where Fortune continues to favor DeSantis and he goes into 2028 as the prohibitive favorite. But time and chance are cruel, and there are many more paths where events conspire against him and he wakes up in 2027 staring at PredictIt odds of 5 percent instead.",
      "If he were at 5 percent odds right now \u2014 if Trump were leading him 75 to 20 in New Hampshire and Iowa rather than roughly 40 to 30 or if Biden\u2019s approval ratings stood at 70 percent instead of 43 percent \u2014 I would buy the argument for waiting.",
      "But DeSantis today is a man already graced by Fortune. And even if the goddess doesn\u2019t always favor boldness, she takes a stern view of those to whom favor is extended who then refuse the gift."

      "The resurgence of Donald Trump in the 2024 primary polls, the unsurprising evidence that his supporters will stand by him through a prosecution and the tentativeness of Ron DeSantis\u2019s precampaign have combined to create a buzz that maybe DeSantis shouldn\u2019t run at all. It\u2019s been whispered by nervous donors, shouted by Trump\u2019s supporters and lately raised by pundits of the left and right.",
      "Thus the liberal Bill Scher, writing in The Washington Monthly, argues that Trump looks too strong, that there isn\u2019t a clear-enough constituency for DeSantis\u2019s promise of Trumpism without the florid drama and that if DeSantis runs and fails, he\u2019s more likely to end up \u201cviciously humiliated,\u201d like Trump\u2019s 2016 rivals, than to set himself up as the next in line for 2028.",
      "Then from the right, writing for The Spectator, Daniel McCarthy channels Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli to argue that while DeSantis probably will run, he would be wiser to choose a more dogged, long-term path instead \u2014 emphasizing \u201cvirtu\u201d rather than chasing Fortune, to use Machiavelli\u2019s language. In 2024 Trump might poison the prospects of any G.O.P. candidate who beats him, while Joe Biden could be a relatively potent incumbent. But if the Florida governor continues to build a record of conservative accomplishment in his home state, \u201c2028 would offer a well-prepared DeSantis a clear shot.\u201d",
      "I think they\u2019re both wrong and that if DeSantis has presidential ambitions he simply has to run right now, notwithstanding all of the obstacles that they identify. My reasoning depends both on the Fortune that McCarthy invokes and on an argument that Scher\u2019s piece nods to while rejecting: the idea that presidential candidates are more likely to miss their moment \u2014 as Chris Christie did when he passed on running in 2012, as Mario Cuomo did for his entire career \u2014 than they are to run too early and suffer a career-ending rebuke.",
      "It\u2019s true that Fortune doesn\u2019t always favor the bold. (As McCarthy notes, that phrase originates in Virgil\u2019s \u201cAeneid,\u201d where it\u2019s uttered by an Italian warlord just before he gets killed.) But the key to the don\u2019t-miss-your-moment argument is that when it comes to something as difficult as gaining the presidency, mostly Fortune doesn\u2019t favor anybody. All would-be presidents, no matter their virtues as politicians, are inevitably hostage to events, depending on unusual synchronicities to open a path to the White House.",
      "A great many successful political careers never have that path open at all. A minority have it open in the narrowest way, where you can imagine threading needles and rolling lucky sixes all the way to the White House. Only a tiny number are confronted with a situation where they seem to have a strong chance, not just a long-shot possibility, before they even announce their candidacy.",
      "That\u2019s where DeSantis sits right now. The political betting site PredictIt places his odds of being elected president in 2024, expressed as a share price, at 23 cents, slightly below Trump\u2019s and well below Biden\u2019s, but far above everybody else\u2019s. Those odds, representing a roughly 20 percent chance at the White House, sound about right to me. If you look at national polls since Trump\u2019s indictment, DeSantis\u2019s support has dipped only slightly; if you look at polls of early primary states, he\u2019s clearly within striking distance, Trump has a floor of support but also a lot of voters who aren\u2019t eager to rally to him (his indictment may have solidified support, but it didn\u2019t make his numbers soar), and DeSantis has not yet even begun to campaign. He\u2019s in a much better position than any of Trump\u2019s rivals ever were in 2016, and you could argue that he starts out closer to the nomination than any Republican candidate did in 2008 or 2012.",
      "Not to run now is to throw this proximity away, in the hopes of starting out even closer four years hence. But DeSantis\u2019s current position is itself a creation of unusual political good fortune. Yes, he\u2019s been skillful, but that skill wouldn\u2019t have gotten him here without events beyond anyone\u2019s control \u2014 the Covid-19 pandemic, the woke revolution in liberal institutions, the split between Mike Pence and Trump after Jan. 6, the strength of the Florida economy and more.",
      "It\u2019s obviously possible to imagine a future where Fortune continues to favor DeSantis and he goes into 2028 as the prohibitive favorite. But time and chance are cruel, and there are many more paths where events conspire against him and he wakes up in 2027 staring at PredictIt odds of 5 percent instead.",
      "If he were at 5 percent odds right now \u2014 if Trump were leading him 75 to 20 in New Hampshire and Iowa rather than roughly 40 to 30 or if Biden\u2019s approval ratings stood at 70 percent instead of 43 percent \u2014 I would buy the argument for waiting.",
      "But DeSantis today is a man already graced by Fortune. And even if the goddess doesn\u2019t always favor boldness, she takes a stern view of those to whom favor is extended who then refuse the gift."

      "The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has proposed a rule that would ban noncompete clauses in employment contracts for low-wage workers. The proposed rule would limit the use of noncompete clauses to only those workers who earn more than $100,000 per year or have management-level responsibilities. This would mean that companies would no longer be able to use noncompete clauses to prevent low-wage workers from finding higher-paying jobs after they leave a company.",
      "Critics of the proposed rule argue that it would limit the ability of companies to protect themselves from competition and retain valuable employees. Supporters of the rule argue that it would help to reduce income inequality and promote job mobility for low-wage workers.",
      "Overall, the proposed rule would represent a significant shift in the way that noncompete clauses are used in employment contracts. While it is unclear how the rule will ultimately be implemented, it highlights the ongoing debate about the role of noncompete clauses in the labor market and the need for a balance between protecting business interests and promoting worker mobility."

    "answer": [
      "The business community has expressed mixed reactions to the FTC's proposed rule on children's online privacy. Some industry groups, such as the Interactive Advertising Bureau, have praised the commission for taking a \"common-sense approach\" to protecting children's privacy while still allowing for targeted advertising (Liptak, 2019). However, other groups, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance, have criticized the proposal as too restrictive and potentially harmful to the growth of online advertising (Liptak, 2019).",
      "The FTC is under pressure to change its position due to concerns raised by some members of Congress and privacy advocates. These critics argue that the proposed rule does not go far enough in protecting children's privacy and that the commission should adopt a more stringent approach (Liptak, 2019). They also point out that the proposed rule does not address the issue of parental consent, which is a key concern for many parents and privacy advocates (Liptak, 2019).",
      "In conclusion, the business community's stance on the FTC's proposed rule is mixed, with some industry groups supporting the commission's approach while others criticize it as too restrictive. The FTC is under pressure to change its position due to concerns raised by members of Congress and privacy advocates, who argue that the proposed rule does not go far enough in protecting children's privacy and that it should be more stringent.",

      "In the debate over free speech and social justice, commentators on the right and the \u201cheterodox\u201d left often claim that college students are all either stridently liberal or cowed into silence by those who are.",
      "As someone who has spent two decades teaching at colleges large and small, public and private, I don\u2019t recognize this description \u2014 and it\u2019s not because I think that it\u2019s conservative students who are dominating the discourse.",
      "In my experience, college students are all too reluctant to express strong opinions about the world at large. I wish my students were so eager to voice their ideas in class. Ideally, they would address the topic of the course, but I\u2019d take what I could get \u2014 the news perhaps, social media more likely, the weather if it came down to it. If they\u2019re talking, then maybe I can steer the conversation toward what they need to learn.",
      "But I\u2019ve found one place where students\u2019 ideas emerge into splendid view: the opinion pages of student newspapers. I recently immersed myself in student papers from across Texas, where I live and teach. It certainly wasn\u2019t a scientific sample, but it gave me new insight into an otherwise reticent population.",
      "In those pages, students test out arguments and exercise their thinking and writing skills in the service of an immediate social purpose. Seemingly unprompted, they have something to say. It\u2019s true that these opinion pages feature some debate about mainstream politics and that voices on the left are more prominent than those on the right. But more frequent (and, to me, much more interesting) are the essays about issues that affect students day to day \u2014 homework during the first week of class, campus grocery delivery, long-distance relationships.",
      "Reading these essays is a deeply reassuring exercise. I see hope for the future of civic life in these students who are brave (or perhaps na\u00efve) enough to examine an issue in their community and make their best case about it in writing. They know what matters to their readers and draw on shared vocabulary and experience. At their best, these essays exhibit all that opinion writing ought to be.",
      "Just as every campus in Texas has its own character, so does every opinion section. At the state\u2019s colossal public universities, opinion essays often voice a complaint to the university bureaucracy. One columnist for the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s Daily Texan made infrastructure a part of his beat, calling for canopies over campus walkways, more bike racks, more emergency call boxes and greater data storage, along with better maintenance of outdoor water fountains on the sprawling, sun-parched campus.",
      "In The Cor Chronicle at the University of Dallas, a Catholic institution, its great-books curriculum is evident in references to Homer, St. Augustine and Alexis de Tocqueville. One Cor Chronicle article from November alluded to Dante\u2019s \u201cInferno\u201d in arguing against public barefootedness. The opinion seemed to rile unshod readers both on and off campus, prompting more than a dozen online comments (a lot for The Cor Chronicle) and two rebuttals in the paper.",
      "The opinion section of The Baylor Lariat includes views on liturgical music and the requirement at Baylor, a Baptist university, that students attend chapel. Lariat writers also turn whimsical, with articles on the enduring relevance of Ugg boots and a rundown of the best bathrooms on campus.",
      "Across the state, student writers challenge one another to be better learners and campus citizens: Get out of the university bubble, put your phone away during class, don\u2019t throw away the cafeteria dishes. One Texas A&M Battalion writer argued that her fellow Aggies should get over their reflexive hatred for U.T. \u2014 a heterodox opinion if there ever was one.",
      "Social justice issues do arise; The North Texas Daily\u2019s opinion page is heavily progressive and concerned with national and even international issues.",
      "But often student opinions are endearingly local, and as a result, they do not easily fit into a left-right dichotomy. There is no liberal orthodoxy on improving the graduation rate at Texas State University or movement-conservative stance on whether to feed the University of Houston\u2019s ubiquitous squirrels.",
      "Still, one prominent student editor, Megan Tran of The Daily Texan, wrote a column expressing concern that the paper had \u201cbecome an echo chamber.\u201d As she told me in an interview, the opinion coverage seemed to examine the same issues \u2014 diversity initiatives, free services for low-income students \u2014 from the same liberal perspective. \u201cI felt like we never reached anyone who didn\u2019t already agree with us,\u201d she said.",
      "This semester she hired columnists who depart from the norm not just politically but also culturally, experientially and academically, drawing from a broad range of majors. Her hope is for The Daily Texan \u201cto reflect the voices of the student body,\u201d she said.",
      "Polls show that traditional-age college students tend to be politically liberal on national issues. But even a conservative former Battalion columnist, Garion Frankel, pushed back against outside claims about the political discourse at A&M. \u201cAs someone who has been an Aggie for five years now and has never felt threatened, pushed out or hampered by the alleged \u2018wokeness\u2019 of my alma mater,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI think it\u2019s worth defending A&M on this front.\u201d And many universities across the country, including U.T.-Austin, have conservative student papers, often funded by outside donors.",
      "The biggest threats to opinion writing on campus appear to be not ideological but economic and administrative, with some university leaders attempting to exercise greater control. Many student newspapers in Texas have cut production or gone dormant in recent years, mirroring trends in the professional media. Several mainstream student papers also now rely on donations to maintain their independence.",
      "The college opinion landscape is more varied than critics would have you believe simply because student writers are engaged with the world as they know it. In many cases, they are trying to persuade an audience of their peers to take actions that matter in the specific context of their community: Resist the social pressure to get engaged before graduating, quit using the anonymous social media app Fizz, stop packing up before class ends.",
      "Or they are thinking through questions that arise during the transition to adulthood. The Texas A&M Battalion columnist Ana Sofia Sloane wrote in November about her ambivalent feelings about turning 20. \u201cIt feels like I\u2019m standing at the edge of a precipice,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIn front of me lies a chasm of uncertainty, responsibility and expectation. Taking the inevitable step forward is difficult.\u201d",
      "Ms. Sloane\u2019s sentiment may seem quaint to those of us who fell into that chasm long ago and have the joint pain to prove it. But this milestone matters to her, just as it once did to me, and it most likely matters to her readers. Her essay does what opinion writing should do for society: help us understand and improve our own and one another\u2019s lives.",

      "In the debate over free speech and social justice, commentators on the right and the \u201cheterodox\u201d left often claim that college students are all either stridently liberal or cowed into silence by those who are.",
      "As someone who has spent two decades teaching at colleges large and small, public and private, I don\u2019t recognize this description \u2014 and it\u2019s not because I think that it\u2019s conservative students who are dominating the discourse.",
      "In my experience, college students are all too reluctant to express strong opinions about the world at large. I wish my students were so eager to voice their ideas in class. Ideally, they would address the topic of the course, but I\u2019d take what I could get \u2014 the news perhaps, social media more likely, the weather if it came down to it. If they\u2019re talking, then maybe I can steer the conversation toward what they need to learn.",
      "But I\u2019ve found one place where students\u2019 ideas emerge into splendid view: the opinion pages of student newspapers. I recently immersed myself in student papers from across Texas, where I live and teach. It certainly wasn\u2019t a scientific sample, but it gave me new insight into an otherwise reticent population.",
      "In those pages, students test out arguments and exercise their thinking and writing skills in the service of an immediate social purpose. Seemingly unprompted, they have something to say. It\u2019s true that these opinion pages feature some debate about mainstream politics and that voices on the left are more prominent than those on the right. But more frequent (and, to me, much more interesting) are the essays about issues that affect students day to day \u2014 homework during the first week of class, campus grocery delivery, long-distance relationships.",
      "Reading these essays is a deeply reassuring exercise. I see hope for the future of civic life in these students who are brave (or perhaps na\u00efve) enough to examine an issue in their community and make their best case about it in writing. They know what matters to their readers and draw on shared vocabulary and experience. At their best, these essays exhibit all that opinion writing ought to be.",
      "Just as every campus in Texas has its own character, so does every opinion section. At the state\u2019s colossal public universities, opinion essays often voice a complaint to the university bureaucracy. One columnist for the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s Daily Texan made infrastructure a part of his beat, calling for canopies over campus walkways, more bike racks, more emergency call boxes and greater data storage, along with better maintenance of outdoor water fountains on the sprawling, sun-parched campus.",
      "In The Cor Chronicle at the University of Dallas, a Catholic institution, its great-books curriculum is evident in references to Homer, St. Augustine and Alexis de Tocqueville. One Cor Chronicle article from November alluded to Dante\u2019s \u201cInferno\u201d in arguing against public barefootedness. The opinion seemed to rile unshod readers both on and off campus, prompting more than a dozen online comments (a lot for The Cor Chronicle) and two rebuttals in the paper.",
      "The opinion section of The Baylor Lariat includes views on liturgical music and the requirement at Baylor, a Baptist university, that students attend chapel. Lariat writers also turn whimsical, with articles on the enduring relevance of Ugg boots and a rundown of the best bathrooms on campus.",
      "Across the state, student writers challenge one another to be better learners and campus citizens: Get out of the university bubble, put your phone away during class, don\u2019t throw away the cafeteria dishes. One Texas A&M Battalion writer argued that her fellow Aggies should get over their reflexive hatred for U.T. \u2014 a heterodox opinion if there ever was one.",
      "Social justice issues do arise; The North Texas Daily\u2019s opinion page is heavily progressive and concerned with national and even international issues.",
      "But often student opinions are endearingly local, and as a result, they do not easily fit into a left-right dichotomy. There is no liberal orthodoxy on improving the graduation rate at Texas State University or movement-conservative stance on whether to feed the University of Houston\u2019s ubiquitous squirrels.",
      "Still, one prominent student editor, Megan Tran of The Daily Texan, wrote a column expressing concern that the paper had \u201cbecome an echo chamber.\u201d As she told me in an interview, the opinion coverage seemed to examine the same issues \u2014 diversity initiatives, free services for low-income students \u2014 from the same liberal perspective. \u201cI felt like we never reached anyone who didn\u2019t already agree with us,\u201d she said.",
      "This semester she hired columnists who depart from the norm not just politically but also culturally, experientially and academically, drawing from a broad range of majors. Her hope is for The Daily Texan \u201cto reflect the voices of the student body,\u201d she said.",
      "Polls show that traditional-age college students tend to be politically liberal on national issues. But even a conservative former Battalion columnist, Garion Frankel, pushed back against outside claims about the political discourse at A&M. \u201cAs someone who has been an Aggie for five years now and has never felt threatened, pushed out or hampered by the alleged \u2018wokeness\u2019 of my alma mater,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI think it\u2019s worth defending A&M on this front.\u201d And many universities across the country, including U.T.-Austin, have conservative student papers, often funded by outside donors.",
      "The biggest threats to opinion writing on campus appear to be not ideological but economic and administrative, with some university leaders attempting to exercise greater control. Many student newspapers in Texas have cut production or gone dormant in recent years, mirroring trends in the professional media. Several mainstream student papers also now rely on donations to maintain their independence.",
      "The college opinion landscape is more varied than critics would have you believe simply because student writers are engaged with the world as they know it.

They may write about the pros and cons of social media, the importance of digital literacy, and the impact of technology on mental health.",
      "4. Environmental issues: As more people become aware of the importance of environmental conservation, students are increasingly writing about environmental issues such as climate change, pollution, and conservation efforts.",
      "5. Personal experiences: Finally, students may write about their personal experiences, such as traveling, volunteering, or overcoming challenges. These stories can be inspiring and thought-provoking, and can encourage others to pursue their own goals and dreams.",

      "In The Cor Chronicle at the University of Dallas, a Catholic institution, its great-books curriculum is evident in references to Homer, St. Augustine and Alexis de Tocqueville. One Cor Chronicle article from November alluded to Dante\u2019s \u201cInferno\u201d in arguing against public barefootedness. The opinion seemed to rile unshod readers both on and off campus, prompting more than a dozen online comments (a lot for The Cor Chronicle) and two rebuttals in the paper.",
      "The opinion section of The Baylor Lariat includes views on liturgical music and the requirement at Baylor, a Baptist university, that students attend chapel. Lariat writers also turn whimsical, with articles on the enduring relevance of Ugg boots and a rundown of the best bathrooms on campus.",
      "Across the state, student writers challenge one another to be better learners and campus citizens: Get out of the university bubble, put your phone away during class, don\u2019t throw away the cafeteria dishes. One Texas A&M Battalion writer argued that her fellow Aggies should get over their reflexive hatred for U.T. \u2014 a heterodox opinion if there ever was one.",

There is no liberal orthodoxy on improving the graduation rate at Texas State University or movement-conservative stance on whether to feed the University of Houston\u2019s ubiquitous squirrels.",
      "Still, one prominent student editor, Megan Tran of The Daily Texan, wrote a column expressing concern that the paper had \u201cbecome an echo chamber.\u201d As she told me in an interview, the opinion coverage seemed to examine the same issues \u2014 diversity initiatives, free services for low-income students \u2014 from the same liberal perspective. \u201cI felt like we never reached anyone who didn\u2019t already agree with us,\u201d she said.",

      "Polls show that traditional-age college students tend to be politically liberal on national issues.

Many student newspapers in Texas have cut production or gone dormant in recent years, mirroring trends in the professional media. Several mainstream student papers also now rely on donations to maintain their independence.",
      "The college opinion landscape is more varied than critics would have you believe simply because student writers are engaged with the world as they know it.

Ideally, they would address the topic of the course, but I\u2019d take what I could get \u2014 the news perhaps, social media more likely, the weather if it came down to it. If they\u2019re talking, then maybe I can steer the conversation toward what they need to learn.",

It certainly wasn\u2019t a scientific sample, but it gave me new insight into an otherwise reticent population.",

It\u2019s true that these opinion pages feature some debate about mainstream politics and that voices on the left are more prominent than those on the right. But more frequent (and, to me, much more interesting) are the essays about issues that affect students day to day \u2014 homework during the first week of class, campus grocery delivery, long-distance relationships.",
      "Reading these essays is a deeply reassuring exercise. I see hope for the future of civic life in these students who are brave (or perhaps na\u00efve) enough to examine an issue in their community and make their best case about it in writing. They know what matters to their readers and draw on shared vocabulary and experience. At their best, these essays exhibit all that opinion writing ought to be.",

      "The 11-point loss of the Republican-aligned candidate in Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court election on Tuesday has influential conservatives rethinking this strategy. \u201cRepublicans had better get their abortion position straight, and more in line with where voters are, or they will face another disappointment in 2024,\u201d said a Wall Street Journal editorial.",
      "Ann Coulter tweeted, \u201cThe demand for anti-abortion legislation just cost Republicans another crucial race,\u201d and added, \u201cPlease stop pushing strict limits on abortion, or there will be no Republicans left.\u201d Jon Schweppe, policy director of the socially conservative American Principles Project, lamented, \u201cWe are getting killed by indie voters who think we support full bans with no exceptions.\u201d",
      "But having made the criminalization of abortion a central axis of their political project for decades, Republicans have no obvious way out of their electoral predicament. A decisive majority of Americans \u2014 64 percent, according to a recent Public Religion Research Institute survey \u2014 believe that abortion should be legal in most cases. A decisive majority of Republicans \u2014 63 percent, according to the same survey \u2014 believe that it should not. When abortion bans were merely theoretical, anti-abortion passion was often a boon to Republicans, powering the grass-roots organizing of the religious right. Now that the end of Roe has awakened a previously complacent pro-choice majority, anti-abortion passion has become a liability, but the Republican Party can\u2019t jettison it without tearing itself apart.",
      "The reason voters think Republicans support full abortion bans, as Schweppe wrote, is that many of them do.",
      "In the last Congress, 167 House Republicans co-sponsored the Life at Conception Act, conferring full personhood rights on fertilized eggs. In state after state, lawmakers are doing just what the R.N.C. suggested and using every means at their disposal to force people to continue unwanted or unviable pregnancies. Idaho, where almost all abortions are illegal, just passed an \u201cabortion trafficking\u201d law that would make helping a minor leave the state to get an abortion without parental consent punishable by five years in prison. The Texas Senate just passed a bill that, among other things, is intended to force prosecutors in left-leaning cities to pursue abortion law violations. South Carolina Republicans have proposed a law defining abortion as murder, making it punishable by the death penalty.",
      "In Florida, which already has a 15-week abortion ban, Gov. Ron DeSantis is expected to soon sign a law banning almost all abortions at six weeks. This isn\u2019t something Florida voters want \u2014 polls show a majority of them support abortion rights \u2014 but it\u2019s a virtual prerequisite for his likely presidential campaign.",
      "Republican attempts to moderate abortion prohibitions even slightly have, for the most part, gone nowhere. Last year, Idaho\u2019s Republican Party defeated an amendment to the party\u2019s platform allowing for an exception to the state\u2019s abortion ban to save a woman\u2019s life. In the weeks before the Wisconsin election on Tuesday, Republican lawmakers introduced a bill providing some narrow exceptions to the state\u2019s abortion prohibition for cases of rape, incest and grave threats to a pregnant person\u2019s health, but they lacked the votes in their own party to pass it.",
      "It\u2019s true that this week Tennessee\u2019s Legislature passed a bill permitting abortion to save a patient\u2019s life or prevent \u201cserious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\u201d But the legislation is meaningless to the point of perversity, since it places the burden of proof on doctors rather than on the state, so that they must still fear prosecution for treating pregnant people in severe medical distress. Language that would allow women to end \u201cmedically futile pregnancies\u201d was stripped out.",
      "It\u2019s not surprising that voters have reacted with revulsion to being stripped of rights they\u2019d long taken for granted, and to seeing the health of pregnant women treated so cavalierly. But the backlash seems to have caught Republicans off guard. Last May, when the Supreme Court\u2019s draft decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization leaked, Coulter assured her readers that the end of Roe wouldn\u2019t help Democrats. \u201cOutside of the media, no one seems especially bothered by the decision,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Part of what happened here is that conservatives fell for their own propaganda about representing \u201cnormal\u201d Americans. (This, incidentally, is the same reason many on the right can\u2019t admit to themselves that Donald Trump lost in 2020.) Coulter was sure Americans would be turned off by those outraged by the end of Roe, writing, \u201cEverybody hates the feminists.\u201d When a poll last year showed that 55 percent of Americans identified as pro-choice, a piece in National Review told readers not to worry: \u201cMany of our policy goals enjoy strong public support.\u201d",
      "Untethered to actual Republican voters, Coulter was able to pivot, but the Republican Party cannot. Instead, its leaders are adopting a self-soothing tactic sometimes seen on the left, insisting they\u2019re being defeated because they\u2019ve failed to make their values clear, not because their values are unpopular. \u201cWhen you\u2019re losing by 10 points, there is a messaging issue,\u201d the Republican Party chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel, said on Fox News, explaining the loss in Wisconsin.",
      "But you can\u2019t message away forced birth. Republicans\u2019 political problem is twofold. Their supporters take the party\u2019s position on abortion seriously, and now, post-Roe, so does everyone else."

    "question": "2. Why did the Republican National Committee recommit itself to anti-abortion maximalism after the 2022 midterms?",
    "answer": [
      "After the 2022 midterms, the Republican National Committee recommitted itself to anti-abortion maximalism due to the party' How to Become a Surrogate Mother in Georgia",
      "If you\u2019re considering becoming a surrogate mother in Georgia, there are a few steps you\u2019ll need to take. Here\u2019s what you need to know to get started.",
      "1. Understand what surrogacy is",
      "Before you can become a surrogate mother, you should have a clear understanding of what surrogacy is. Surrogacy is a type of assisted reproduction in which a woman carries and delivers a baby for another person or couple. The surrogate provides the egg and/or the uterus for the embryo to implant in, and the intended parents provide the sperm and/or eggs.",
      "2. Research surrogacy laws in Georgia",
      "Surrogacy laws vary from state to state, and Georgia has specific laws governing surrogacy. You should familiarize yourself with these laws before you begin the process of becoming a surrogate mother. In Georgia, surrogacy is legal, but there are strict requirements that must be met. For example, the surrogate and intended parents must be unrelated, and the surrogate must be at least 21 years old and have given birth to at least one child.",
      "3. Contact a surrogacy agency or attorney",
      "If you\u2019re interested in becoming a surrogate mother in Georgia, you should contact a surrogacy agency or attorney. These professionals can provide you with information about the surrogacy process, answer your questions, and help you navigate the legal requirements.",
      "4. Undergo medical and psychological screening",
      "Before you can become a surrogate mother, you\u2019ll need to undergo medical and psychological screening. This includes a medical exam to ensure that you\u2019re in good health, as well as psychological evaluations to ensure that you\u2019re mentally and emotionally prepared for the process.",
      "5. Sign a surrogacy agreement",
      "Once you\u2019ve been screened and approved, you\u2019ll need to sign a surrogacy agreement with the intended parents. This agreement outlines the terms of the surrogacy arrangement, including compensation, medical expenses, and legal rights.",
      "6. Conceive and carry the baby",
      "If you\u2019re matched with intended parents and have successfully conceived, you\u2019ll need to carry and deliver the baby. This may involve taking hormones, having regular checkups, and undergoing medical procedures to ensure a healthy pregnancy.",
      "Becoming a surrogate mother is a complex process that requires careful consideration and preparation. If you\u2019re interested in becoming a surrogate mother in Georgia, it\u2019s important to work with a reputable surrogacy agency or attorney who can guide you through the process and ensure that your rights and interests are protected."

      "The 11-point loss of the Republican-aligned candidate in Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court election on Tuesday has influential conservatives rethinking this strategy. \u201cRepublicans had better get their abortion position straight, and more in line with where voters are, or they will face another disappointment in 2024,\u201d said a Wall Street Journal editorial.",
      "Ann Coulter tweeted, \u201cThe demand for anti-abortion legislation just cost Republicans another crucial race,\u201d and added, \u201cPlease stop pushing strict limits on abortion, or there will be no Republicans left.\u201d Jon Schweppe, policy director of the socially conservative American Principles Project, lamented, \u201cWe are getting killed by indie voters who think we support full bans with no exceptions.\u201d",
      "But having made the criminalization of abortion a central axis of their political project for decades, Republicans have no obvious way out of their electoral predicament.

A decisive majority of Republicans \u2014 63 percent, according to the same survey \u2014 believe that it should not. When abortion bans were merely theoretical, anti-abortion passion was often a boon to Republicans, powering the grass-roots organizing of the religious right. Now that the end of Roe has awakened a previously complacent pro-choice majority, anti-abortion passion has become a liability, but the Republican Party can\u2019t jettison it without tearing itself apart.",
      "The reason voters think Republicans support full abortion bans, as Schweppe wrote, is that many of them do.",
      "In the last Congress, 167 House Republicans co-sponsored the Life at Conception Act, conferring full personhood rights on fertilized eggs. In state after state, lawmakers are doing just what the R.N.C. suggested and using every means at their disposal to force people to continue unwanted or unviable pregnancies. Idaho, where almost all abortions are illegal, just passed an \u201cabortion trafficking\u201d law that would make helping a minor leave the state to get an abortion without parental consent punishable by five years in prison. The Texas Senate just passed a bill that, among other things, is intended to force prosecutors in left-leaning cities to pursue abortion law violations. South Carolina Republicans have proposed a law defining abortion as murder, making it punishable by the death penalty.",

This isn\u2019t something Florida voters want \u2014 polls show a majority of them support abortion rights \u2014 but it\u2019s a virtual prerequisite for his likely presidential campaign.",
      "Republican attempts to moderate abortion prohibitions even slightly have, for the most part, gone nowhere. Last year, Idaho\u2019s Republican Party defeated an amendment to the party\u2019s platform allowing for an exception to the state\u2019s abortion ban to save a woman\u2019s life. In the weeks before the Wisconsin election on Tuesday, Republican lawmakers introduced a bill providing some narrow exceptions to the state\u2019s abortion prohibition for cases of rape, incest and grave threats to a pregnant person\u2019s health, but they lacked the votes in their own party to pass it.",
      "It\u2019s true that this week Tennessee\u2019s Legislature passed a bill permitting abortion to save a patient\u2019s life or prevent \u201cserious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\u201d But the legislation is meaningless to the point of perversity, since it places the burden of proof on doctors rather than on the state, so that they must still fear prosecution for treating pregnant people in severe medical distress. Language that would allow women to end \u201cmedically futile pregnancies\u201d was stripped out.",
      "It\u2019s not surprising that voters have reacted with revulsion to being stripped of rights they\u2019d long taken for granted, and to seeing the health of pregnant women treated so cavalierly. But the backlash seems to have caught Republicans off guard. Last May, when the Supreme Court\u2019s draft decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization leaked, Coulter assured her readers that the end of Roe wouldn\u2019t help Democrats. \u201cOutside of the media, no one seems especially bothered by the decision,\u201d she wrote.",

This isn\u2019t something Florida voters want \u2014 polls show a majority of them support abortion rights \u2014 but it\u2019s a virtual prerequisite for his likely presidential campaign.",
      "Republican attempts to moderate abortion prohibitions even slightly have, for the most part, gone nowhere. Last year, Idaho\u2019s Republican Party defeated an amendment to the party\u2019s platform allowing for an exception to the state\u2019s abortion ban to save a woman\u2019s life. In the weeks before the Wisconsin election on Tuesday, Republican lawmakers introduced a bill providing some narrow exceptions to the state\u2019s abortion prohibition for cases of rape, incest and grave threats to a pregnant person\u2019s health, but they lacked the votes in their own party to pass it.",
      "It\u2019s true that this week Tennessee\u2019s Legislature passed a bill permitting abortion to save a patient\u2019s life or prevent \u201cserious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\u201d But the legislation is meaningless to the point of perversity, since it places the burden of proof on doctors rather than on the state, so that they must still fear prosecution for treating pregnant people in severe medical distress. Language that would allow women to end \u201cmedically futile pregnancies\u201d was stripped out.",
      "It\u2019s not surprising that voters have reacted with revulsion to being stripped of rights they\u2019d long taken for granted, and to seeing the health of pregnant women treated so cavalierly. But the backlash seems to have caught Republicans off guard. Last May, when the Supreme Court\u2019s draft decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization leaked, Coulter assured her readers that the end of Roe wouldn\u2019t help Democrats. \u201cOutside of the media, no one seems especially bothered by the decision,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Part of what happened here is that conservatives fell for their own propaganda about representing \u201cnormal\u201d Americans. (This, incidentally, is the same reason many on the right can\u2019t admit to themselves that Donald Trump lost in 2020.) Coulter was sure Americans would be turned off by those outraged by the end of Roe, writing, \u201cEverybody hates the feminists.\u201d When a poll last year showed that 55 percent of Americans identified as pro-choice, a piece in National Review told readers not to worry: \u201cMany of our policy goals enjoy strong public support.\u201d",
      "Untethered to actual Republican voters, Coulter was able to pivot, but the Republican Party cannot. Instead, its leaders are adopting a self-soothing tactic sometimes seen on the left, insisting they\u2019re being defeated because they\u2019ve failed to make their values clear, not because their values are unpopular. \u201cWhen you\u2019re losing by 10 points, there is a messaging issue,\u201d the Republican Party chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel, said on Fox News, explaining the loss in Wisconsin.",
      "But you can\u2019t message away forced birth. Republicans\u2019 political problem is twofold. Their supporters take the party\u2019s position on abortion seriously, and now, post-Roe, so does everyone else."

    "question": "5. What is the main reason why voters think Republicans support full abortion bans?",
    "answer": [
      "The main reason why voters think Republicans support full abortion bans is due to the perception that the party is anti-choice and seeks to restrict access to reproductive healthcare.",
      "This perception is largely driven by the Republican Party's stance on abortion, which is often characterized as being opposed to abortion rights.",
      "For example, the party's platform states that it is committed to protecting the \"unborn\" and supports a \"human life amendment\" to the Constitution.",
      "This stance has led to the passage of several state-level abortion bans and restrictions, further reinforcing the perception that Republicans are anti-choice.",

      "The survey also underscored the persistent problem of affordability as people struggled to pay their share of health care costs. About 40 percent of those surveyed said they had delayed or gone without care in the last year because of the expense. People in fair or poor health were more than twice as likely to report problems with paying medical bills than those in better health, and Black adults were more likely than white adults to indicate they had trouble.",
      "Nearly half of those who encountered a problem with their insurance said they could not satisfactorily resolve it. Some could not obtain the care they had sought, while others said they paid more than expected. Among the nearly 60 percent who reported difficulty with their insurance coverage, 15 percent said their health had declined.",

      "A majority of Americans with health insurance said they had encountered obstacles to coverage, including denied medical care, higher bills and a dearth of doctors in their plans, according to a new survey from KFF, a nonprofit health research group. As a result, some people delayed or skipped treatment.",
      "Those who were most likely to need medical care \u2014 people who described themselves as in fair or poor health \u2014 reported more trouble; three-fourths of those receiving mental health treatment experienced problems.",
      "\u201cThe consequences of care delayed and missed altogether because of the sheer complexity of the system are significant, especially for people who are sick,\u201d said Drew Altman, the chief executive of KFF, formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation.",
      "The survey also underscored the persistent problem of affordability as people struggled to pay their share of health care costs. About 40 percent of those surveyed said they had delayed or gone without care in the last year because of the expense. People in fair or poor health were more than twice as likely to report problems with paying medical bills than those in better health, and Black adults were more likely than white adults to indicate they had trouble.",
      "Nearly half of those who encountered a problem with their insurance said they could not satisfactorily resolve it. Some could not obtain the care they had sought, while others said they paid more than expected. Among the nearly 60 percent who reported difficulty with their insurance coverage, 15 percent said their health had declined.",
      "\u201cThis survey shows it\u2019s not enough to just get a card in your pocket \u2014 the insurance has to work or it\u2019s not exactly coverage,\u201d said Karen Pollitz, the co-director for KFF\u2019s patient and consumer protections program.",
      "People have a hard time understanding their coverage and benefits, with 30 percent or more reporting difficulty figuring out what they will be required to pay for care or what exactly their insurance will cover.",
      "\u201cInsurances are way more complicated than they should be,\u201d said Amanda Parente, a 19-year-old college student in Nashville who is covered under her mother\u2019s employer plan. She was surprised to find that her out-of-pocket costs spiked recently when she sought treatment for strep throat. While she realized her co-payments would be higher, \u201cI guess we didn\u2019t know how drastic it was going to be,\u201d she said.",
      "Navigating the intricacies of coverage and benefits were similar regardless of what kind of insurance people had. At least half of those surveyed with private coverage, through an employer, those with an Obamacare plan, or a government program like Medicare or Medicaid, said they experienced difficulties.",
      "People might be unhappy with their coverage because they were already concerned about higher inflation and potential layoffs, said Christopher Lis, the managing director of global health care intelligence at J.D. Power, which found that consumer satisfaction with insurers had declined in a recent study. \u201cWe\u2019ve got economic conditions that set the stage for concern around coverage and benefits,\u201d he said.",
      "Insurers say people generally report being happy with their plan, and 81 percent of those surveyed by KFF gave their insurance high ratings. \u201cHealth insurance providers are committed to improving access, affordability and convenience for all Americans and will continue to find innovative solutions to work toward this common goal,\u201d said David Allen, a spokesman for AHIP, a trade group that represents insurers.",
      "Also striking among the survey\u2019s findings was how unaware people were about pursuing appeals of denied coverage and how to go about doing so.",
      "\u201cMost people don\u2019t know who to call,\u201d Ms. Pollitz said. Sixty percent of insured adults surveyed did not know they had a legal right to appeal, and about three-fourths said they did not know which government agency to contact for help, particularly respondents with private insurance.",
      "State insurance regulators oversee fully insured policies sold to individuals and small businesses, and the federal Department of Labor has jurisdiction over employer-sponsored insurance.",
      "Many of the problems people have with their insurance could be solved by enforcing existing rules, like federal regulations requiring private insurers to issue understandable explanations of benefits and to maintain accurate, current lists of doctors and hospitals within their networks."
    ],
    "question": "5. What are the responsibilities of state and federal insurance regulators in ensuring that insurance policies are transparent and accessible to consumers?",
    "answer": [
      "State and federal insurance regulators play a critical role in ensuring that insurance policies are transparent and accessible to consumers. Firstly, regulators are responsible for enforcing transparency in the insurance industry by setting guidelines and standards for the disclosure of information. This includes requirements for clear and concise policy language, the provision of sample contracts, and the availability of information on premiums, coverage, and exclusions.",
      "Secondly, regulators must ensure that insurance policies are accessible to consumers by providing education and resources to help consumers understand their insurance options. This includes the provision of online resources, public forums, and educational materials that are tailored to the needs of consumers.",
      "Finally, regulators must actively monitor the insurance industry to ensure that insurers are complying with transparency and accessibility requirements. This includes conducting regular audits and investigations, as well as taking enforcement action when necessary to protect consumers.",
      "In conclusion, state and federal insurance regulators play a vital role in ensuring that insurance policies are transparent and accessible to consumers. By setting guidelines and standards, providing education and resources, and actively monitoring the industry, regulators can help to protect consumers from fraudulent and deceptive practices and ensure that they have the information they need to make informed decisions about their insurance coverage."

    "question": "2. How do Republicans maintain their control over the House of Representatives?",
    "answer": [
      "1. Money and campaign funding: One of the primary ways Republicans maintain control over the House of Representatives is through the extensive use of money and campaign funding. Republicans have historically been better funded than Democrats, and this has allowed them to outspend their opponents in elections. The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) is responsible for supporting Republican candidates in House races, and it is heavily funded by wealthy donors and corporations. This financial advantage gives Republicans an edge in fundraising and allows them to run more effective campaigns.",
      "2. Gerrymandering: Another key factor in Republican control of the House is gerrymandering, which is the practice of manipulating electoral district boundaries for political gain. Republicans have been successful in using gerrymandering to create a disproportionate number of safe Republican seats, which makes it difficult for Democratic candidates to win elections. This has led to a situation where Republicans have a built-in advantage in the House, as they are able to rely on a larger number of safe seats to maintain their majority.",
      "3. Ideological purity tests: Finally, Republicans have implemented ideological purity tests for their members, which has helped to maintain their control over the House. These tests require members to sign pledges promising to support certain conservative policies, such as cutting taxes, reducing regulation, and opposing abortion. By requiring members to sign these pledges, Republicans are able to maintain a unified front and ensure that their members are all committed to a conservative agenda. This has helped to keep Republicans in line and has made it difficult for moderate or centrist Republicans to gain power within the party."

As a result, these voters \u2014 often described as the American working class \u2014 are crucial to winning elections. Yet many of them are deeply skeptical of today\u2019s Democratic Party.",
      "Republicans retook control of the House last year by winning most districts with below-median incomes. In nearly 20 Western and Southern states, Democrats are virtually shut out of statewide offices largely because of their weakness among the white working class. Since 2018, the party has also lost ground with Black, Asian and especially Latino voters.",
      "Unless the party improves its standing with blue-collar voters, \u201cthere\u2019s no way for progressive Democrats to advance their agenda in the Senate,\u201d according to a study that the Center for Working-Class Politics, a left-leaning research group, released this morning.",
      "The class inversion of American politics \u2014 with most professionals supporting Democrats and more working-class people backing Republicans \u2014 is one of the most consequential developments in American life (and, as regular readers know, a continuing theme of this newsletter).",
      "Today, I\u2019ll be writing about what Democrats might do about the problem, focusing on a new YouGov poll, conducted as part of the Center for Working-Class Politics study. In an upcoming newsletter, I\u2019ll examine the issue from a conservative perspective and specifically how Republicans might alter their economic agenda to better serve their new working-class base.",
      "A key point is that even modest shifts in the working-class vote can decide elections. If President Biden wins 50 percent of the non-college vote next year, he will almost certainly be re-elected. If he wins only 45 percent, he will probably lose.",
      "Elections can be tricky for social scientists to study. The sample sizes are small and idiosyncratic. Researchers can\u2019t conduct hundreds of elections in a laboratory, changing one variable at a time and analyzing how the results change. But researchers can conduct polls that pit hypothetical candidates against each other and see how the results change when the candidates\u2019 biographies, messages and policy proposals change.",
      "This approach, which has become more common among pollsters, is the one that YouGov used. It focused on swing voters \u2014 those who don\u2019t identify strongly with either party, many of whom are working class. The poll described a pair of Democratic candidates, each with a biography and a campaign platform, and asked respondents which one they preferred.",
      "Among the findings:",
      "I find the study\u2019s conclusions fascinating because they are both original and consistent with other evidence. Democrats who have won difficult recent elections, including both progressives and moderates, have often presented a blue-collar image.",
      "President Biden talks about growing up in a working-class neighborhood. Marie Gluesenkamp P\u00e9rez, who owns a car-repair shop, flipped a House district in Washington State partly by criticizing her own party for being elitist. Senator Sherrod Brown, the only Democrat to win statewide in Ohio since 2011, is a populist. So is John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, the only Senate candidate from either party to flip a seat last year.",
      "Many Americans are frustrated with the country\u2019s direction, and they want candidates who will promise to fight for their interests. One of the vulnerabilities of today\u2019s Democratic Party, as my colleague Nate Cohn has written, is that it has come to be associated with the establishment.",

    "question": "4. What is the class inversion of American politics and how does it affect the political landscape?",
    "answer": [
      "The class inversion of American politics refers to the shift in the distribution of wealth and power from the traditional upper and middle classes to a new group of elites, including the top 1% of income earners, the wealthy, and corporate interests. This shift has had a significant impact on the political landscape, as it has led to a concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a small group of individuals who have the ability to influence political outcomes.",
      "One of the main effects of the class inversion is the rise of political polarization. As the wealthy and corporate interests have become more influential, they have been able to shape the political agenda to their benefit, leading to a divide between the haves and have-nots. This has led to a political environment in which compromise is seen as a weakness, and political parties are often seen as representing different factions of the wealthy elite rather than the interests of the broader population.",
      "Another effect of the class inversion is the erosion of democratic norms and institutions. As the wealthy and corporate interests have become more powerful, they have been able to undermine democratic norms and institutions, such as the free press and the judiciary. This has led to a political environment in which the interests of the wealthy elite are prioritized over the needs and desires of the broader population.",
