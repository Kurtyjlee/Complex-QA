We lived modestly, with my father\u2019s government pension and financial help from my uncle. There was no money for extras.",

In time, with training and learning on the job, I became a senior editor of the station\u2019s business programme.",

    "question": "1. What was the biggest lesson your father taught you that has guided you throughout your growing-up years and shaped your personality?",
    "answer": [
      " One of the biggest lessons my father taught me is the importance of hard work and perseverance. Growing up, I remember him always emphasizing the value of putting in effort and never giving up, regardless of the challenges that come our way. This lesson has stayed with me throughout my life and has become a fundamental part of my personality.",
      "Firstly, I learned that success is not achieved overnight, but rather through consistent effort and dedication. My father has always been a hard-working man, and his example has inspired me to work hard and strive for excellence in all that I do. This lesson has taught me the value of patience, persistence, and resilience, and has helped me to overcome obstacles and setbacks along the way.",
      "Secondly, I learned that failure is a natural part of the learning process. My father has never been afraid to take risks and try new things, and he has always encouraged me to do the same. However, he has also taught me that failure is not the end, but rather an opportunity to learn and grow from our mistakes. This has helped me to develop a growth mindset and to embrace challenges as opportunities for personal development.",
      "Finally, I learned that success is not just about what you achieve, but also about how you achieve it. My father has always emphasized the importance of integrity, honesty, and ethics in all that we do. He has taught me that success is not just about achieving our goals, but also about how we treat others and how we contribute to the greater good. This has helped me to develop a strong sense of purpose and to make decisions that align with my values and principles.",
      "Overall, the lesson of hard work and perseverance that my father taught me has had a profound impact on my life. It has shaped my personality, my values, and my approach to life, and has helped me to overcome challenges and achieve my goals. I am grateful for his guidance and for the example he has set for me, and I strive to pass on this valuable lesson to others."

      "Secondly, it made me more independent and self-reliant. With my father absent, I had to learn to take care of myself and my siblings more. I had to figure out how to do things on my own, like doing laundry, cooking, and even taking care of my younger siblings. This made me more responsible and independent, and it taught me valuable life skills that I still use today.",

This taught me how to be more resilient and adaptable, and it made me more confident in my ability to handle whatever life throws my way.",
      "Overall, my father's absence during my childhood had a significant impact on my days back then. It made me feel lonely, independent, resilient, and adaptable. However, it also taught me valuable life lessons that I still carry with me today."

      "I never got to know my father well. He died suddenly when I was nine. He was only 44.",
      "Although I didn\u2019t have much time with him, I have fond memories of my boyhood days. And on Father\u2019s Day every year, I look at his photograph, say a little prayer for him, and thank him for all that he gave me during our brief time together.",
      "I grew up in Klang, a city in Selangor in Malaysia, where my father worked as a civil servant. After his death, my mother, older brother and I moved to Singapore where my uncle gave us a place to live. We lived modestly, with my father\u2019s government pension and financial help from my uncle. There was no money for extras.",
      "It was the absence of my father that marked my days back then. I missed how he doted on my brother and me, how he came home with presents and took us out to the movies. Most of all, I missed how he answered all our endless questions, which came easy for him as he had encyclopaedic knowledge.",
      "What I remember most are the lessons he taught me that have guided me throughout my growing-up years and shaped my personality.",
      "As a young boy, I took my father\u2019s words as gospel truth and the advice he gave as gold, holding them close to my heart.",
      "The biggest lesson has to be the \u201c272-steps lesson\u201d.",
      "When I was around six years old, our family visited the Batu Caves Hindu temple near Kuala Lumpur. The mouth of Batu Caves was at the top of numerous and steep steps. When my father said there were 272 steps, I told him I would not make it all the way to the top.",
      "His reply gave me the motivation to go for it: Getting to the top was just a matter of taking 16 steps to reach a landing, then another 16 steps to get to the next one, and if I kept going from one landing to another, I would reach the caves.",
      "And so we climbed \u2013 my father holding my hand and both of us counting the steps out loud until we reached the caves.",
      "The lesson learnt: Don\u2019t be daunted by a big problem, as it can be tackled by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts.",
      "I applied this lesson throughout my life \u2013 breaking a task into smaller steps, stages and sequences to eventually get it done. This approach to problem-solving has stood me in good stead in my personal and professional life.",
      "When I was 45, I made a mid-career switch from stockbroking to journalism, joining CNA as a business reporter. As I knew little about TV production, I applied what my father taught me \u2013 do things in steps, stages and sequences. In time, with training and learning on the job, I became a senior editor of the station\u2019s business programme.",
      "Another lesson I learnt from my father was foundation-building. I remember as a child stacking building blocks, putting a square or round piece on top of another to see how high I could build the tower before the whole structure came crashing down.",
      "My first few attempts collapsed in double-quick time. After seeing my failed attempts, my father showed me how I needed to build a strong foundation in order to get taller towers. I should not rush it, and take care to align the pieces to get a more stable structure.",
      "I followed his advice, and my towers stood tall and did not collapse.",
      "Building strong foundations became an integral part of everything I did in life. I was always well prepared before an examination, I trained hard before running a marathon, and I researched extensively before covering a news event.",
      "My father also made sure he built a strong foundation in the education of his two sons. When we turned three, he introduced us to the alphabet, taught us numbers and read books to us to build up our vocabulary. He made us do simple sums and memorise the multiplication table.",
      "On our family trips to other towns in Malaysia, my father would make us solve mental maths problems. To keep us occupied during the long drives, he asked us to work out how long it would take to get to the destination based on the speed of the car and the distance left to go.",
      "There were also memory games, such as naming the capital cities of countries and the dates of historical events.",
      "We went to the library regularly to borrow books, and he bought junior encyclopaedias to help us improve our general knowledge. He helped us with homework and reminded us to always go beyond what we learnt in school.",
      "I grew up loving books and studied English literature in school. I developed a passion for writing and published two novels.",
      "My father was a kind-hearted and generous man. He gave to charities readily and lent money to his cash-strapped colleagues. Our barber, who needed money for his family in India, borrowed from my father, who never asked for the loan to be repaid.",
      "He talked to us about faith, and most importantly, showed us through his actions the importance of living life with honesty and integrity.",
      "He told me never to take what was not mine at times when I found things. When I was a Scout in school, he reminded me during Job Week that I should do my best, as I was getting paid for the work. He told me he always gave his all, for the organisations he worked in and the people he worked with.",
      "Of course, my father had his weaknesses. He loved food too much, often overate and rarely exercised. As he was only in his 40s when he died from typhoid fever, I have always wondered if he could have recovered from the bacterial infection if he had taken better care of his health.",
      "My father could also be indecisive and lacked composure. I remember an incident when a beehive at the back of our house fell to the ground, and my father ran for cover from the swarm of bees. My mother\u2019s quick thinking in setting the hive on fire saved the day.",
      "Despite his shortcomings and his brief time with us, he had a lasting impact on our lives. I would like to think that he had a hand in the success story of my brother, who rose through the ranks to become a rear-admiral in the Singapore Navy and was Chief of Navy before he retired.",
      "Although I do not have children of my own, I do have advice for all the fathers out there \u2013 teach your children well, as what you say will leave an indelible impression and stay with them for the rest of their lives. Just like how my father\u2019s words and wise counsel have guided me through mine.",

Firstly, it has taught me to break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable steps, which has helped me to tackle challenges in a systematic and efficient manner. This approach has been particularly useful in my professional life, where I have been able to approach projects and tasks with a clear plan of action, leading to better outcomes and greater success.",
      "Secondly, my father's approach has instilled in me a strong sense of perseverance and determination. When faced with a difficult problem, breaking it down into smaller parts allows me to focus on one step at a time, rather than becoming overwhelmed by the overall task. This approach has helped me to persist through challenges and setbacks, and to stay focused on the goal until it is achieved.",
      "Finally, my father's approach has also taught me the value of collaboration and teamwork. By breaking down a problem into smaller parts, it becomes easier to identify areas where different perspectives and skills can be brought to bear, leading to a more comprehensive and effective solution. This approach has been particularly useful in my personal life, where I have been able to work effectively with others to achieve common goals.",
      "In conclusion, my father's approach to problem-solving has had a profound influence on my personal and professional life. It has taught me the importance of breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable parts, and has instilled in me a strong sense of perseverance and determination. Additionally, it has emphasized the value of collaboration and teamwork, leading to more effective and comprehensive solutions."

      "Frederick Lim",
      "I never got to know my father well. He died suddenly when I was nine. He was only 44.",
      "Although I didn\u2019t have much time with him, I have fond memories of my boyhood days. And on Father\u2019s Day every year, I look at his photograph, say a little prayer for him, and thank him for all that he gave me during our brief time together.",
      "I grew up in Klang, a city in Selangor in Malaysia, where my father worked as a civil servant. After his death, my mother, older brother and I moved to Singapore where my uncle gave us a place to live. We lived modestly, with my father\u2019s government pension and financial help from my uncle. There was no money for extras.",
      "It was the absence of my father that marked my days back then. I missed how he doted on my brother and me, how he came home with presents and took us out to the movies. Most of all, I missed how he answered all our endless questions, which came easy for him as he had encyclopaedic knowledge.",
      "What I remember most are the lessons he taught me that have guided me throughout my growing-up years and shaped my personality.",
      "As a young boy, I took my father\u2019s words as gospel truth and the advice he gave as gold, holding them close to my heart.",
      "The biggest lesson has to be the \u201c272-steps lesson\u201d.",
      "When I was around six years old, our family visited the Batu Caves Hindu temple near Kuala Lumpur. The mouth of Batu Caves was at the top of numerous and steep steps. When my father said there were 272 steps, I told him I would not make it all the way to the top.",
      "His reply gave me the motivation to go for it: Getting to the top was just a matter of taking 16 steps to reach a landing, then another 16 steps to get to the next one, and if I kept going from one landing to another, I would reach the caves.",
      "And so we climbed \u2013 my father holding my hand and both of us counting the steps out loud until we reached the caves.",
      "The lesson learnt: Don\u2019t be daunted by a big problem, as it can be tackled by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts.",
      "I applied this lesson throughout my life \u2013 breaking a task into smaller steps, stages and sequences to eventually get it done. This approach to problem-solving has stood me in good stead in my personal and professional life.",
      "When I was 45, I made a mid-career switch from stockbroking to journalism, joining CNA as a business reporter. As I knew little about TV production, I applied what my father taught me \u2013 do things in steps, stages and sequences. In time, with training and learning on the job, I became a senior editor of the station\u2019s business programme.",
      "Another lesson I learnt from my father was foundation-building. I remember as a child stacking building blocks, putting a square or round piece on top of another to see how high I could build the tower before the whole structure came crashing down.",
      "My first few attempts collapsed in double-quick time. After seeing my failed attempts, my father showed me how I needed to build a strong foundation in order to get taller towers. I should not rush it, and take care to align the pieces to get a more stable structure.",
      "I followed his advice, and my towers stood tall and did not collapse.",
      "Building strong foundations became an integral part of everything I did in life. I was always well prepared before an examination, I trained hard before running a marathon, and I researched extensively before covering a news event.",
      "My father also made sure he built a strong foundation in the education of his two sons. When we turned three, he introduced us to the alphabet, taught us numbers and read books to us to build up our vocabulary. He made us do simple sums and memorise the multiplication table.",
      "On our family trips to other towns in Malaysia, my father would make us solve mental maths problems. To keep us occupied during the long drives, he asked us to work out how long it would take to get to the destination based on the speed of the car and the distance left to go.",
      "There were also memory games, such as naming the capital cities of countries and the dates of historical events.",
      "We went to the library regularly to borrow books, and he bought junior encyclopaedias to help us improve our general knowledge. He helped us with homework and reminded us to always go beyond what we learnt in school.",
      "I grew up loving books and studied English literature in school. I developed a passion for writing and published two novels.",
      "My father was a kind-hearted and generous man. He gave to charities readily and lent money to his cash-strapped colleagues. Our barber, who needed money for his family in India, borrowed from my father, who never asked for the loan to be repaid.",
      "He talked to us about faith, and most importantly, showed us through his actions the importance of living life with honesty and integrity.",
      "He told me never to take what was not mine at times when I found things. When I was a Scout in school, he reminded me during Job Week that I should do my best, as I was getting paid for the work. He told me he always gave his all, for the organisations he worked in and the people he worked with.",
      "Of course, my father had his weaknesses. He loved food too much, often overate and rarely exercised. As he was only in his 40s when he died from typhoid fever, I have always wondered if he could have recovered from the bacterial infection if he had taken better care of his health.",
      "My father could also be indecisive and lacked composure. I remember an incident when a beehive at the back of our house fell to the ground, and my father ran for cover from the swarm of bees. My mother\u2019s quick thinking in setting the hive on fire saved the day.",
      "Despite his shortcomings and his brief time with us, he had a lasting impact on our lives. I would like to think that he had a hand in the success story of my brother, who rose through the ranks to become a rear-admiral in the Singapore Navy and was Chief of Navy before he retired.",
      "Although I do not have children of my own, I do have advice for all the fathers out there \u2013 teach your children well, as what you say will leave an indelible impression and stay with them for the rest of their lives. Just like how my father\u2019s words and wise counsel have guided me through mine.",

      "\u201cMake sure to look your age.\u201d",
      "This was my friend\u2019s blunt advice to me when I told her I was gearing up for a fellowship interview a few weeks ago.",
      "Puzzled, I assured her that reporting assignments and previous internships had prepared me to dress formally and appropriately for the occasion.",
      "\u201cNo, not just that. Be sure not to appear \u2018too young\u2019, perhaps put your hair up and avoid pinks or pastels,\u201d she said, a suggestion I found somewhat amusing.",
      "My friend, who like me is petite and around 1.5m tall, had recently been told during an interview for an overseas posting that she was too young for the job despite having the eight years of experience asked for in the advertisement.",
      "While she could not know for certain why the company was not keen on her after the meeting, she felt it had to do with her appearance \u2013 that she was deemed unsuitable as she looked younger than her 30 years.",
      "Her experience got me thinking about the way employers may judge a candidate\u2019s eligibility for a job based on appearance. While looking well groomed and professional for an interview shows that the candidate is serious about the position, looking \u201ctoo young\u201d despite being competent is something beyond the control of millennials and Generation Z job seekers.",
      "While ageism is commonly associated with discrimination against older workers, \u201creverse ageism\u201d refers to the challenges of workers in their 20s and 30s who are hampered by age-specific stereotypes, such as being inexperienced and naive, that employers have of people of their age group.",
      "Reverse ageism is not new, but it has been in focus lately among younger employees in post-pandemic times, as many bemoan the disruptions to their career development, finances and life plans over the past three years.",
      "A study by the American Psychological Association in 2017 noted that younger employees actually experienced an equal or higher level of workplace discrimination than their older colleagues.",
      "A survey by the National Trades Union Congress\u2019 Employment and Employability Institute in 2019 looked at how millennials responded to stereotypes about their generation. While most agreed that millennials are prone to job-hopping and are tech-savvy, they disputed the stereotypes that they are selfish and unable to take hardship or instructions from a superior.",
      "Some respondents said many millennials faced challenges that were different from and, in some cases, worse than those of the previous generation. These include degree inflation, a term referring to the declining value of degrees as more people have access to tertiary education; the constant need to recalibrate their skills to meet technological changes; and a longer trajectory to reach life milestones, like home or car ownership.",
      "Ageism, like other forms of discrimination, is intersectional \u2013 meaning age intertwines with other aspects of a person\u2019s identity, such as gender and economic status. Taken together, their disadvantages in the workforce increase.",
      "A 2021 review on reverse ageism published on the American National Institutes of Health\u2019s website noted that compared with their male peers, there was significant discrimination against younger women applying for highly skilled administrative jobs, reflecting the double whammy of both ageism and sexism in the workplace.",
      "Many of these findings made me realise that the conventional idea of how to look and act at different ages of our lives no longer applied to people of my generation and the generations to come.",
      "Add to this the fact that we are marrying and parenting later in life, and have different sets of responsibilities and priorities compared with previous generations, with many renting rather than owning housing, travelling significantly more than our predecessors, and pushing for more work-life balance.",
      "The years of living with Covid-19 have also affected the way we look and behave. For instance, a 2021 study in medical journal The Lancet found that the prevalence of smoking among young people had decreased at the global level by approximately 33 per cent over the past 30 years.",
      "There are fewer drinkers too. A report by the BBC in 2022 found that more young people were embracing being \u201csober curious\u201d \u2013 drinking less and choosing to socialise while being sober \u2013 as a result of fewer opportunities to socialise or drink during the pandemic.",
      "In terms of mental health, millennials, who were dubbed the \u201ctherapy generation\u201d by a 2019 Wall Street Journal article, are seeking help more often than the previous generations.",
      "Such lifestyle choices may continue to play an important part in how we age and the choices we make in the future.",
      "In her widely shared May 2023 article in British Vogue titled \u201cWhy do so many millennials look and seem so much younger than they are?\u201d, writer Daisy Jones looked at how millennials are ageing differently from their predecessors, partly because the norms surrounding age-specific lifestyles and clothing have changed.",
      "Jones interpreted being called \u201cyounger\u201d as not being taken seriously, despite her achievements and credentials.",
      "I have seen these changing norms in women who are juggling motherhood and their careers in ways others may deem unconventional.",
      "A relative in her mid-30s went on hiatus from full-time work after the birth of her first child a year ago and is considering a postgraduate degree while pregnant with her second child. In the meantime, she is doing remote project-based work that pays well.",
      "Given the disruptions, employers must act and workplace culture must change to tackle both forms of ageism when it comes to hiring, career progression and flexible working arrangements, in order to avoid generational conflict between younger and older workers.",
      "An article on job portal MyCareersFuture.sg noted that ageism at the workplace leads to a decrease in productivity and meritocracy, as the focus falls on workers\u2019 age rather than their skills and talents.",
      "One way to tackle reverse ageism is to provide more opportunities for older and younger employees to interact through mentoring and training programmes, to let them learn from and understand one another better.",
      "Another option is for companies to consciously recruit and build intergenerational teams to capitalise on the strengths of different age groups.",
      "Tapping young professionals\u2019 guilds and groups, as well as networking opportunities, will also allow young people to bank on a support network of peers to help them navigate their career paths.",
      "In future, safeguards against reverse ageism, which is often difficult to address, should also be reflected in national labour laws and company policies, such as moving away from looking at a candidate\u2019s years of experience to the quality of the experience, and instituting diverse hiring panels that value the inputs of both junior and senior employees.",
      "This will help foster greater inclusivity in the job market, so that workers with potential can focus more on the job than on how their appearance, lifestyle choices and personal views are perceived in the workplace."

      "\u201cNo, not just that. Be sure not to appear \u2018too young\u2019, perhaps put your hair up and avoid pinks or pastels,\u201d she said, a suggestion I found somewhat amusing.",
      "My friend, who like me is petite and around 1.5m tall, had recently been told during an interview for an overseas posting that she was too young for the job despite having the eight years of experience asked for in the advertisement.",
      "While she could not know for certain why the company was not keen on her after the meeting, she felt it had to do with her appearance \u2013 that she was deemed unsuitable as she looked younger than her 30 years.",
      "Her experience got me thinking about the way employers may judge a candidate\u2019s eligibility for a job based on appearance. While looking well groomed and professional for an interview shows that the candidate is serious about the position, looking \u201ctoo young\u201d despite being competent is something beyond the control of millennials and Generation Z job seekers.",
      "While ageism is commonly associated with discrimination against older workers, \u201creverse ageism\u201d refers to the challenges of workers in their 20s and 30s who are hampered by age-specific stereotypes, such as being inexperienced and naive, that employers have of people of their age group.",
      "Reverse ageism is not new, but it has been in focus lately among younger employees in post-pandemic times, as many bemoan the disruptions to their career development, finances and life plans over the past three years.",
      "A study by the American Psychological Association in 2017 noted that younger employees actually experienced an equal or higher level of workplace discrimination than their older colleagues.",
      "A survey by the National Trades Union Congress\u2019 Employment and Employability Institute in 2019 looked at how millennials responded to stereotypes about their generation. While most agreed that millennials are prone to job-hopping and are tech-savvy, they disputed the stereotypes that they are selfish and unable to take hardship or instructions from a superior.",
      "Some respondents said many millennials faced challenges that were different from and, in some cases, worse than those of the previous generation. These include degree inflation, a term referring to the declining value of degrees as more people have access to tertiary education; the constant need to recalibrate their skills to meet technological changes; and a longer trajectory to reach life milestones, like home or car ownership.",
      "Ageism, like other forms of discrimination, is intersectional \u2013 meaning age intertwines with other aspects of a person\u2019s identity, such as gender and economic status. Taken together, their disadvantages in the workforce increase.",
      "A 2021 review on reverse ageism published on the American National Institutes of Health\u2019s website noted that compared with their male peers, there was significant discrimination against younger women applying for highly skilled administrative jobs, reflecting the double whammy of both ageism and sexism in the workplace.",
      "Many of these findings made me realise that the conventional idea of how to look and act at different ages of our lives no longer applied to people of my generation and the generations to come.",
      "Add to this the fact that we are marrying and parenting later in life, and have different sets of responsibilities and priorities compared with previous generations, with many renting rather than owning housing, travelling significantly more than our predecessors, and pushing for more work-life balance.",
      "The years of living with Covid-19 have also affected the way we look and behave. For instance, a 2021 study in medical journal The Lancet found that the prevalence of smoking among young people had decreased at the global level by approximately 33 per cent over the past 30 years.",
      "There are fewer drinkers too. A report by the BBC in 2022 found that more young people were embracing being \u201csober curious\u201d \u2013 drinking less and choosing to socialise while being sober \u2013 as a result of fewer opportunities to socialise or drink during the pandemic.",
      "In terms of mental health, millennials, who were dubbed the \u201ctherapy generation\u201d by a 2019 Wall Street Journal article, are seeking help more often than the previous generations.",
      "Such lifestyle choices may continue to play an important part in how we age and the choices we make in the future.",
      "In her widely shared May 2023 article in British Vogue titled \u201cWhy do so many millennials look and seem so much younger than they are?\u201d, writer Daisy Jones looked at how millennials are ageing differently from their predecessors, partly because the norms surrounding age-specific lifestyles and clothing have changed.",
      "Jones interpreted being called \u201cyounger\u201d as not being taken seriously, despite her achievements and credentials.",
      "I have seen these changing norms in women who are juggling motherhood and their careers in ways others may deem unconventional.",
      "A relative in her mid-30s went on hiatus from full-time work after the birth of her first child a year ago and is considering a postgraduate degree while pregnant with her second child. In the meantime, she is doing remote project-based work that pays well.",
      "Given the disruptions, employers must act and workplace culture must change to tackle both forms of ageism when it comes to hiring, career progression and flexible working arrangements, in order to avoid generational conflict between younger and older workers.",
      "An article on job portal MyCareersFuture.sg noted that ageism at the workplace leads to a decrease in productivity and meritocracy, as the focus falls on workers\u2019 age rather than their skills and talents.",
      "One way to tackle reverse ageism is to provide more opportunities for older and younger employees to interact through mentoring and training programmes, to let them learn from and understand one another better.",
      "Another option is for companies to consciously recruit and build intergenerational teams to capitalise on the strengths of different age groups.",
      "Tapping young professionals\u2019 guilds and groups, as well as networking opportunities, will also allow young people to bank on a support network of peers to help them navigate their career paths.",
      "In future, safeguards against reverse ageism, which is often difficult to address, should also be reflected in national labour laws and company policies, such as moving away from looking at a candidate\u2019s years of experience to the quality of the experience, and instituting diverse hiring panels that value the inputs of both junior and senior employees.",

    "question": "4. What is ageism?",
    "answer": [
      " Ageism is a form of discrimination or prejudice against individuals based on their age. It can manifest in various ways, including negative stereotypes, biased attitudes, and unequal treatment in the workplace or other settings. Ageism can affect individuals of all ages, including older adults who may face age-related discrimination, as well as younger individuals who may be subject to age-related stereotypes and biases.",
      "Claim 1: Ageism is a prevalent form of discrimination in many societies.",
      "Evidence: Ageism is a widespread issue that affects individuals of all ages. Research has shown that age discrimination is a significant problem in many countries, with many individuals reporting experiencing ageism in the workplace or other settings.",
      "Claim 2: Ageism can have negative impacts on individuals' well-being and self-esteem.",
      "Evidence: Ageism can have a negative impact on an individual's self-esteem and well-being. Research has shown that older adults who experience ageism may experience feelings of isolation, depression, and low self-esteem. Additionally, younger individuals who experience ageism may also experience negative impacts on their well-being and self-esteem.",
      "Claim 3: Efforts should be made to address ageism in all its forms.",
      "Evidence: Addressing ageism is essential to creating a more inclusive and equitable society for all ages. This can be achieved through education and awareness campaigns, anti-ageism policies and initiatives, and promoting age diversity and inclusivity in all settings. By addressing ageism, we can create a more positive and supportive environment for individuals of all ages."

      " As a society, we are becoming increasingly aware of the impact of stereotypes on individuals and groups, and younger employees are no exception. Research has shown that stereotypes about younger generations can be particularly harmful, as they can limit opportunities and perpetuate negative stereotypes.",
      "One response to these stereotypes is for younger employees to reject them and work to challenge them. This can involve actively seeking out opportunities to prove themselves and demonstrating their abilities in the workplace. Younger employees may also seek out mentors or role models who can help them to overcome stereotypes and break down barriers.",
      "Another response is for younger employees to embrace their stereotypes and use them to their advantage. This can involve using the energy and enthusiasm associated with youth to drive innovation and creativity in the workplace. Some younger employees may also use stereotypes to create a sense of community and solidarity among their peers.",
      "Overall, it is important for employers to recognize that stereotypes about younger generations can be harmful and to work to create a workplace culture that values diversity and inclusivity. This can involve actively seeking out diverse perspectives and experiences, providing opportunities for mentorship and professional development, and actively working to combat stereotypes and biases. By doing so, employers can create a workplace that is more productive, innovative, and inclusive for all employees."

    "question": "7. What is degree inflation?",
    "answer": [
      " Degree Inflation is a phenomenon that has emerged in higher education where the number of degrees awarded has increased significantly over the years, often without a corresponding increase in the level of knowledge or skills of the graduates. This has led to concerns that many degrees are being watered down, and that the value of a degree is being diminished.",
      "Claim 1: Degree inflation has led to a decrease in the quality of education in higher institutions.",
      "One of the main criticisms of degree inflation is that it has led to a decrease in the quality of education in higher institutions. This is because the number of degrees being awarded has increased so rapidly that institutions have had to lower their standards in order to keep up with the demand. This has resulted in students being awarded degrees without having the necessary knowledge or skills to demonstrate their competence in a particular field.",
      "Claim 2: The over-production of degrees has led to a surplus of graduates in the job market.",
      "Another concern is that the over-production of degrees has led to a surplus of graduates in the job market. This has made it difficult for recent graduates to find employment, as there are simply too many people competing for too few jobs. This has led to a decrease in the value of a degree, as employers are no longer able to rely on a degree as a guarantee of a person's competence.",
      "Claim 3: The increase in the number of degrees awarded has also led to an increase in student debt.",
      "Finally, the increase in the number of degrees being awarded has also led to an increase in student debt. Many students are taking on significant amounts of debt in order to pay for their education, and they are often left with significant amounts of debt even after graduating. This has led to concerns that students are being priced out of higher education, and that the cost of a degree is becoming unaffordable.",
      "In conclusion, degree inflation is a serious issue in higher education that has led to a decrease in the quality of education, a surplus of graduates in the job market, and an increase in student debt. These issues have significant implications for both students and employers, and they highlight the need for institutions to re-evaluate their policies and practices in order to ensure that degrees remain a valuable and meaningful indicator of competence and achievement."

      "\u201cMake sure to look your age.\u201d",
      "This was my friend\u2019s blunt advice to me when I told her I was gearing up for a fellowship interview a few weeks ago.",
      "Puzzled, I assured her that reporting assignments and previous internships had prepared me to dress formally and appropriately for the occasion.",
      "\u201cNo, not just that. Be sure not to appear \u2018too young\u2019, perhaps put your hair up and avoid pinks or pastels,\u201d she said, a suggestion I found somewhat amusing.",
      "My friend, who like me is petite and around 1.5m tall, had recently been told during an interview for an overseas posting that she was too young for the job despite having the eight years of experience asked for in the advertisement.",
      "While she could not know for certain why the company was not keen on her after the meeting, she felt it had to do with her appearance \u2013 that she was deemed unsuitable as she looked younger than her 30 years.",
      "Her experience got me thinking about the way employers may judge a candidate\u2019s eligibility for a job based on appearance. While looking well groomed and professional for an interview shows that the candidate is serious about the position, looking \u201ctoo young\u201d despite being competent is something beyond the control of millennials and Generation Z job seekers.",
      "While ageism is commonly associated with discrimination against older workers, \u201creverse ageism\u201d refers to the challenges of workers in their 20s and 30s who are hampered by age-specific stereotypes, such as being inexperienced and naive, that employers have of people of their age group.",
      "Reverse ageism is not new, but it has been in focus lately among younger employees in post-pandemic times, as many bemoan the disruptions to their career development, finances and life plans over the past three years.",
      "A study by the American Psychological Association in 2017 noted that younger employees actually experienced an equal or higher level of workplace discrimination than their older colleagues.",
      "A survey by the National Trades Union Congress\u2019 Employment and Employability Institute in 2019 looked at how millennials responded to stereotypes about their generation. While most agreed that millennials are prone to job-hopping and are tech-savvy, they disputed the stereotypes that they are selfish and unable to take hardship or instructions from a superior.",
      "Some respondents said many millennials faced challenges that were different from and, in some cases, worse than those of the previous generation. These include degree inflation, a term referring to the declining value of degrees as more people have access to tertiary education; the constant need to recalibrate their skills to meet technological changes; and a longer trajectory to reach life milestones, like home or car ownership.",
      "Ageism, like other forms of discrimination, is intersectional \u2013 meaning age intertwines with other aspects of a person\u2019s identity, such as gender and economic status. Taken together, their disadvantages in the workforce increase.",
      "A 2021 review on reverse ageism published on the American National Institutes of Health\u2019s website noted that compared with their male peers, there was significant discrimination against younger women applying for highly skilled administrative jobs, reflecting the double whammy of both ageism and sexism in the workplace.",
      "Many of these findings made me realise that the conventional idea of how to look and act at different ages of our lives no longer applied to people of my generation and the generations to come.",
      "Add to this the fact that we are marrying and parenting later in life, and have different sets of responsibilities and priorities compared with previous generations, with many renting rather than owning housing, travelling significantly more than our predecessors, and pushing for more work-life balance.",
      "The years of living with Covid-19 have also affected the way we look and behave. For instance, a 2021 study in medical journal The Lancet found that the prevalence of smoking among young people had decreased at the global level by approximately 33 per cent over the past 30 years.",
      "There are fewer drinkers too. A report by the BBC in 2022 found that more young people were embracing being \u201csober curious\u201d \u2013 drinking less and choosing to socialise while being sober \u2013 as a result of fewer opportunities to socialise or drink during the pandemic.",
      "In terms of mental health, millennials, who were dubbed the \u201ctherapy generation\u201d by a 2019 Wall Street Journal article, are seeking help more often than the previous generations.",
      "Such lifestyle choices may continue to play an important part in how we age and the choices we make in the future.",
      "In her widely shared May 2023 article in British Vogue titled \u201cWhy do so many millennials look and seem so much younger than they are?\u201d, writer Daisy Jones looked at how millennials are ageing differently from their predecessors, partly because the norms surrounding age-specific lifestyles and clothing have changed.",
      "Jones interpreted being called \u201cyounger\u201d as not being taken seriously, despite her achievements and credentials.",
      "I have seen these changing norms in women who are juggling motherhood and their careers in ways others may deem unconventional.",
      "A relative in her mid-30s went on hiatus from full-time work after the birth of her first child a year ago and is considering a postgraduate degree while pregnant with her second child. In the meantime, she is doing remote project-based work that pays well.",
      "Given the disruptions, employers must act and workplace culture must change to tackle both forms of ageism when it comes to hiring, career progression and flexible working arrangements, in order to avoid generational conflict between younger and older workers.",
      "An article on job portal MyCareersFuture.sg noted that ageism at the workplace leads to a decrease in productivity and meritocracy, as the focus falls on workers\u2019 age rather than their skills and talents.",
      "One way to tackle reverse ageism is to provide more opportunities for older and younger employees to interact through mentoring and training programmes, to let them learn from and understand one another better.",
      "Another option is for companies to consciously recruit and build intergenerational teams to capitalise on the strengths of different age groups.",
      "Tapping young professionals\u2019 guilds and groups, as well as networking opportunities, will also allow young people to bank on a support network of peers to help them navigate their career paths.",
      "In future, safeguards against reverse ageism, which is often difficult to address, should also be reflected in national labour laws and company policies, such as moving away from looking at a candidate\u2019s years of experience to the quality of the experience, and instituting diverse hiring panels that value the inputs of both junior and senior employees.",
      "This will help foster greater inclusivity in the job market, so that workers with potential can focus more on the job than on how their appearance, lifestyle choices and personal views are perceived in the workplace."

    "question": "8. How does the conventional idea of age apply to people of the writer's generation and future generations?",
    "answer": [
      " The conventional idea of age is a social construct that has been shaped by cultural, historical, and societal factors. In the past, age was often used as a marker of maturity, experience, and wisdom. However, with the rapid pace of technological change and shifting cultural norms, the conventional idea of age is becoming increasingly irrelevant.",
      "For people of the writer's generation, the conventional idea of age may still hold some weight, as many were raised in a time when age was a more significant factor in society. However, as people are living longer and staying healthier, age is becoming less of a determinant of physical and mental abilities. In the future, this shift in perception of age is likely to continue, with age becoming less of a factor in determining a person's potential and capabilities.",
      "Furthermore, as society becomes more diverse and inclusive, the conventional idea of age is likely to be challenged even more. Age is often used as a proxy for experience and wisdom, but this assumption may not be accurate for all individuals. In the future, it is likely that the conventional idea of age will be redefined to better reflect the diversity of society, with age being seen as just one aspect of a person's identity.",
      "In conclusion, the conventional idea of age is becoming increasingly irrelevant, and is likely to continue to change in the future as society evolves. The idea of age as a determinant of potential and capabilities is likely to become less significant, and will be replaced by a more nuanced understanding of age as just one aspect of a person's identity."

    "answer": [
      " Living with Covid-19 has had a significant impact on the way people look and behave. Here are three key claims that support this statement:",
      "1. Clothing choices have changed: With the widespread adoption of masks and face coverings, people have had to adapt their clothing choices to accommodate these items. Many individuals now wear masks in public places, and those who do not wear masks may still choose to wear face coverings to avoid contact with others. This has led to an increase in the popularity of clothing and accessories that can be worn over masks, such as hoods and scarves.",
      "2. Social behavior has been altered: The social distancing measures put in place during the pandemic have had a significant impact on social behavior. People have had to become more cautious and reserved in their interactions with others, avoiding physical contact and limiting the number of people they come into contact with. This has led to a decrease in the frequency and intensity of social interactions, as well as a shift towards online communication.",
      "3. Mental health has been affected: The prolonged nature of the pandemic has had a significant impact on mental health, with many people experiencing anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. The constant fear of contracting the virus and the uncertainty of the future has taken a toll on individuals, leading to changes in behavior and an increased reliance on self-care and isolation."

      " 10. What are the main arguments for and against the use of nuclear energy?",
      "Claim: The use of nuclear energy has several advantages, such as providing a large amount of electricity, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and providing energy security. However, there are also several disadvantages to nuclear energy, such as the high upfront costs, the risk of accidents, and the issue of nuclear waste.",
      "Evidence: Nuclear energy is a reliable source of electricity, and it can provide a large amount of power without producing greenhouse gas emissions. Nuclear power plants can operate continuously, and they do not produce emissions during operation. This means that they can provide a steady stream of electricity, which is particularly useful for large industrial and commercial users. In addition, the cost of nuclear energy is relatively low compared to other forms of electricity generation, such as solar or wind power. However, there are also several disadvantages to nuclear energy. The construction of a nuclear power plant is expensive, and the cost of building a new plant can be several billion dollars. In addition, there is a risk of accidents at nuclear power plants, which can lead to environmental damage and public health concerns. Finally, the disposal of nuclear waste is a major issue, as it can be highly radioactive and pose a risk to public health and the environment for thousands of years."

The club has been a central hub for horse racing enthusiasts and has played a vital role in promoting the sport in Singapore. The closure will result in the loss of jobs for the employees who work at the club, and it will also have a negative impact on the local economy.",
      "One of the most significant impacts of the closure will be on the employees who work at the Singapore Turf Club. The club has been a major employer in the local area, providing jobs for a variety of people including jockeys, trainers, and support staff. The loss of these jobs will have a negative impact on the local community, as many people will be left without employment.",
      "In addition to the impact on the local community, the closure of the Singapore Turf Club will also have a negative impact on the local economy. The club generates a significant amount of revenue for the local area, and the loss of this revenue will be felt by local businesses. The closure will also have a negative impact on the tourism industry, as the club attracts visitors from around the world who come to watch horse racing.",
      "Overall, the closure of the Singapore Turf Club will have a significant impact on the horse racing fraternity, including the loss of jobs, negative impact on the local community and economy."

They offer a range of educational programs and activities that promote environmental awareness and encourage the conservation of natural resources. This helps to create a sense of environmental responsibility among Singaporeans and promotes sustainable development.",

    "question": "6. How might the closure of the STC impact the ecological connections between nature areas around Kranji?",
    "answer": [
      " The closure of the STC could have a significant impact on the ecological connections between nature areas around Kranji. The STC serves as a critical wildlife corridor that connects several nature areas in the region, including the Kranji Marshes, the Kranji Nature Reserve, and the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve. The STC also provides a vital link between the various habitats found within these nature areas, including mangrove forests, wetlands, and freshwater and brackish water bodies.",
      "Without the STC, the wildlife that rely on this corridor for movement and habitat connectivity would be severely impacted. For example, the migratory birds that use the STC as a flyway would be unable to navigate between their breeding and nesting grounds in the north and their wintering grounds in the south. Similarly, the freshwater and brackish water fish that rely on the STC for migration and spawning would be impacted by the closure.",
      "Furthermore, the closure of the STC could also impact the ecological processes that take place within the surrounding nature areas. For example, the STC helps to regulate water levels within the wetlands and mangrove forests, which can impact the growth and survival of various plant and animal species.",
      "In conclusion, the closure of the STC would have a significant impact on the ecological connections between nature areas around Kranji, and would likely result in negative consequences for the wildlife and ecological processes within these areas. It is therefore important to explore alternative solutions to preserve the STC and maintain the ecological connections between nature areas in the region."

This can be achieved by creating a network of green spaces and natural areas that connect these habitats and allow for the free movement of wildlife. This can not only help to preserve the local biodiversity, but also create a more sustainable and livable environment for the new town's residents.",
      "Another opportunity is to incorporate green infrastructure into the design of the new town. This can include using native plants and materials in the construction of buildings, roads, and other infrastructure, as well as incorporating green spaces and natural areas into the layout of the town. This can help to reduce the urban heat island effect, improve air and water quality, and create a more livable and sustainable environment for the new town's residents.",
      "Finally, incorporating nature corridors into the new town can also help to promote a sense of community and connection to the natural environment. By creating green spaces and natural areas that are accessible to all residents, the new town can create a shared sense of place and identity that is grounded in the local environment. This can help to foster a sense of community and belonging among the town's residents and create a more vibrant and livable environment for all."

      "The horse racing fraternity has reacted with dismay to the Government\u2019s recent decision to close the Singapore Turf Club (STC) in Kranji.",
      "This will mean the end of the 180-year-old sport in Singapore and the loss of hundreds of jobs. It also leaves horse owners, jockeys and the horses themselves facing an uncertain future.",
      "Despite the sympathy for STC\u2019s employees, the 120ha of land freed up by the club\u2019s closure opens up many possibilities for other urgent land use requirements.",
      "Put simply, one key aim of land use planning is to use any given piece of land to bring the most benefits to the most people.",
      "With local horse racing experiencing declining spectatorship over the years, it makes sense to redevelop the land on which the STC sits to meet urgent housing demand, especially for public housing.",
      "The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has indicated that planning for the site will take two or three years. Beyond the housing, leisure and recreation uses already announced, it is too early to speculate what else might come up on the land.",
      "However, there are hints about how government agencies plan to approach the site.",
      "A spokesman for the URA has noted that Singapore\u2019s northern region as a whole is very \u201cgreen\u201d and that the authority would take the surrounding context into account.",
      "The surrounding physical context includes the Mandai Mangrove and Mudflat Nature Park to the north, and the Kranji Reservoir, Kranji Coastal Nature Park and Kranji Marshes to the north-east and east. The Rail Corridor is also just north of the STC site.",
      "Beyond physical factors, general attitudes towards greenery have evolved over the years.",
      "Indeed, it was reported earlier in June in The Straits Times that a study by the National University of Singapore (NUS) Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions quantified what I had long noticed among my own friends and acquaintances \u2013 that Singaporeans value views of greenery enough to pay a premium for them.",
      "This means we have moved beyond equating greenery only with formal parks or nature areas.",
      "The Rail Corridor, for example, is a green leisure and recreation space for daytime joggers and walkers, but also doubles as a route for cyclists going to work, and a linkway for wildlife connectivity at night.",
      "The Clementi Nature Corridor announced by the National Parks Board in July 2021 as an ecological connection between Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and the Southern Ridges, and the 400ha Sungei Buloh Nature Park Network, are emblematic of the Government\u2019s current science-based approach to managing the balance between nature conservation and development needs.",
      "In that regard, beyond parks and landscaped greenery, there could be an opportunity for incorporating nature corridors in any new town at the STC site to improve the ecological links between existing nature areas around Kranji.",
      "The recent NUS study also noted that the area of greenery per person within residential towns declined from 17.7 sq m to 13.7 sq m from 2008 to 2020. Given the premium we place on it, I believe most Singaporeans would welcome it if we could add to the amount of greenery in Singapore.",
      "According to news reports, URA has not ruled out the possibility of retaining some STC structures if it makes sense to keep or repurpose them for other uses.",
      "Adaptive re-use of existing buildings was in the news recently when The Business Times reported London-based environmental engineer Patrick Bellew and Singapore building experts arguing that in terms of embodied carbon, it is not environmentally sustainable to demolish buildings and rebuild them.",
      "Embodied carbon refers to the greenhouse gases that are released when building materials are made, transported and assembled. According to Mr Bellew, even for \u201csuper green\u201d buildings, embodied carbon constitutes about 80 per cent of the carbon emissions in the first 50 years of a building\u2019s lifespan.",
      "In other words, no matter how environmentally sustainable a building is when operational, a lot of its carbon emissions had already been expended during its construction and early years.",
      "Adaptive re-use of existing buildings would help negate the excessive carbon emissions inherent in the demolish-and-rebuild model.",
      "With the STC now about 25 years old, its buildings are good candidates for adaptive re-use as they are unlikely to be near the end of their structural lifespan.",
      "In fact, there are precedents overseas of sporting stadiums being repurposed for housing and other uses.",
      "One example is the old Highbury stadium, the home of Arsenal Football Club for 93 years until 2006. The stadium was converted into apartments for the new Highbury Square development.",
      "In the American city of Indianapolis, the 80-year-old grandstand of the historic Bush baseball stadium was converted into an apartment complex known as Stadium Lofts, which opened in 2013.",
      "This, of course, does not necessarily mean that a different building, like STC\u2019s grandstand, can be similarly repurposed.",
      "Would retaining the grandstand unacceptably constrain the development potential and spatial planning of the rest of the site? Is the building suitable to be repurposed for the uses being considered, and would the effort be prohibitively expensive or too time-consuming to be practical?",
      "These are tough questions and hard economics, and pragmatism may render adaptive re-use of the grandstand unfeasible.",
      "However, there is value in considering the preservation of the intangible social memory of horse racing\u2019s long history in Singapore once it is gone, and honouring those who were part of it.",
      "If there is scope for adaptive re-use of the grandstand, one can imagine a day in the not-too-distant future when former STC employees or horse trainers could visit the lush and green new town and point out the repurposed grandstand to their children.",
      "Even with their illustrious sport gone, the building would be a meaningful legacy of Singapore\u2019s horse racing heritage, and the glory days of the Kranji racetrack.",
      "\u2022 Wee Jin Sin was an urban planner at the Urban Redevelopment Authority and an airport planner at the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore. He is now pursuing a graduate diploma in counselling psychology."

    "answer": [
      " 8. How can social media be used effectively in political campaigns?",
      "Social media can be an effective tool in political campaigns by providing a platform for candidates to reach a large audience, build their brand, and engage with voters. Here are three key ways in which social media can be used effectively in political campaigns:",
      "1. Reach a large audience: Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram provide a way for candidates to reach a large audience quickly and efficiently. Candidates can use social media to create and share content, such as videos, images, and posts, that resonate with their target audience. By using hashtags and other targeting options, candidates can reach people who are interested in their message and engage with them.",
      "2. Build brand identity: Social media provides a way for candidates to build their brand identity and establish a strong presence online. Candidates can use social media to showcase their values, personality, and vision for the future. By consistently posting engaging content and interacting with followers, candidates can build a loyal following and increase their visibility.",
      "3. Engage with voters: Social media allows candidates to engage with voters in a personal and meaningful way. Candidates can use social media to answer questions, respond to feedback, and share updates about their campaign. By engaging with voters, candidates can build trust and show that they are accessible and responsive to the needs of the community.",
      "Overall, social media can be a powerful tool in political campaigns by providing a way for candidates to reach a large audience, build their brand, and engage with voters. By using social media effectively, candidates can increase their visibility, build support, and ultimately win the election."

      "What are the key considerations that determine which buildings or sites are to be conserved and which are to be redeveloped? How can our urban planners continue to ensure that Singapore\u2019s land use needs are fulfilled while at the same time retaining our heritage?",
      "This ongoing tension arose again with recent announcements that the Singapore Turf Club would cease its racing operations at Kranji. The 120ha Kranji site will be returned to the Government and redeveloped for housing and other needs.",
      "The move will free up much-needed land to address our urgent needs for more housing and commercial spaces.",
      "Considering the 180-year history of horse racing in Singapore, it is by no means an easy decision. But there are several factors that make this necessary.",
      "Closing the racecourse will support the development of a northern economic hub known as Woodlands Regional Centre, a plan that had already been articulated in the Housing Board\u2019s (HDB) 2017 Remaking Our Heartland programme.",
      "Such efforts to create regional business hubs are also part of the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)\u2019s \u201cLocal Hubs, Global Gateways\u201d strategy which aims to provide more commercial space outside the Central Business District (CBD).",
      "According to real estate consultancy Knight Frank, office rents in the CBD rose in the first quarter of 2023, driven by a combination of tight supply and strong demand.",
      "Singapore is also facing high demand for housing, which has translated into rising home prices and rents. In the first quarter of 2023, private home prices rose by 3.3 per cent while those of resale HDB flats rose by 0.9 per cent.",
      "As the space needs of Singapore\u2019s residents and its industries continue to grow, it will become necessary to redevelop existing sites to build more housing estates, innovation parks, satellite business districts and other projects.",
      "Besides driving urban redevelopment, the URA is also in charge of conserving historically significant buildings. According to the authority, conservation requires an appreciation and understanding of the architecture and structure of historic buildings, with the aim of retaining their inherent spirit and original ambience.",
      "Considerations for whether to conserve a building therefore involve the historical significance of the building, its architectural merit, as well as the original ambience of the building.",
      "The recent gazetting of Golden Mile Complex as a conserved building is a good case in point, given its post-independence modernist Brutalist style of architecture and popularity as a mixed-use development.",
      "However, given Singapore\u2019s land constraints and urgent land-use needs, it will be increasingly difficult to justify the conservation of buildings and facilities that occupy large plots of land.",
      "At 120ha, the Kranji Turf Club is almost four times the size of Dover Forest (33ha) and more than double the size of Keppel Club (48ha). Both of those sites have been slated for redevelopment into housing estates.",
      "While critics of the Dover Forest redevelopment suggested building flats on existing vacant sites, housing estates are in reality developed as an integrated whole.",
      "This means that housing estates need to include not only homes but also transport infrastructure, schools, markets, food outlets and medical facilities, requiring large plots of land rather than random pockets of space.",
      "The impetus for the Turf Club\u2019s closure is also related to a broader decline of interest in horse racing.",
      "According to a report from The Economist, horse racing viewership and attendance have been decreasing rapidly in the United States, pushed by declining interest in the sport as well as the proliferation of alternative gambling venues like casinos.",
      "In Singapore, horse racing average attendance has fallen from 6,000 per day in 2019 to current levels of 2,600 per day.",
      "Beyond its size, a racecourse is also a highly specialised facility that is designed to provide space for the care, training and racing of horses.",
      "At the Singapore Turf Club, there are multiple tracks for different race types and training purposes, racing and resting stables to accommodate horses, and an equine pool for training purposes. There are also a grandstand and carparks for accommodating spectators on race days.",
      "It will not be easy to convert such facilities for residential and commercial uses, nor will it be an optimal use of space and resources.",
      "It is possible that for the same reasons, other countries have considered closure of their horse racing tracks.",

      "In the United Kingdom, the Folkestone Racecourse in the county of Kent was closed in 2012 and recently approved for redevelopment into Otterpool Park Garden Town. This is a sustainability-focused town development that will provide housing, business premises and recreational facilities.",
      "In both instances, the demolishment (or proposed demolishment) of a racecourse frees up space for building homes and green spaces.",

      "In Athens, there is the Panathenaic Stadium which was built around 330 BC. It has gone through refurbishments over the course of its history and remains in use as an Olympics venue.",
      "Given space constraints, Singapore will often face difficult trade-offs between urban redevelopment and conservation.",
      "This is further complicated by the fact that both are emotionally charged issues that matter a great deal to many.",

      " When considering which buildings or sites to conserve and which to redevelop, several key considerations must be taken into account. These include historical, cultural, and architectural significance, as well as economic and social factors.",
      "Firstly, historical and cultural significance is a crucial factor in determining which buildings or sites should be conserved. These are places that have historical or cultural value to the community and have the potential to provide insight into the community's past. For example, heritage buildings such as churches, museums, and historic landmarks often have significant cultural value and should be conserved to preserve the community's history.",
      "Secondly, architectural significance is another key consideration when deciding which buildings or sites to conserve. These are buildings that have unique architectural features or designs that make them stand out from others. For instance, buildings with distinctive styles or historical significance, such as art deco buildings, should be conserved to preserve the city's aesthetic and cultural identity.",
      "Additionally, economic and social factors must also be considered when deciding which buildings or sites to conserve. These include the economic impact of conserving a building or site, such as preserving jobs and protecting local businesses, as well as the social impact of conserving a building or site, such as preserving community gathering places and cultural identity.",
      "In conclusion, when considering which buildings or sites to conserve and which to redevelop, several key considerations must be taken into account, including historical, cultural, and architectural significance, as well as economic and social factors. It is important to consider all of these factors in order to make an informed decision that balances the needs of the community and the preservation of cultural heritage."

      "Urban redevelopment can come into conflict with preserving heritage. In land-scarce Singapore, it is often inevitable.",
      "But effective urban planning is necessary to ensure that the nation\u2019s land use needs are met. This often requires our urban planners to redevelop existing plots of land to create space for new developments.",
      "What are the key considerations that determine which buildings or sites are to be conserved and which are to be redeveloped? How can our urban planners continue to ensure that Singapore\u2019s land use needs are fulfilled while at the same time retaining our heritage?",
      "This ongoing tension arose again with recent announcements that the Singapore Turf Club would cease its racing operations at Kranji. The 120ha Kranji site will be returned to the Government and redeveloped for housing and other needs.",
      "The move will free up much-needed land to address our urgent needs for more housing and commercial spaces.",
      "Considering the 180-year history of horse racing in Singapore, it is by no means an easy decision. But there are several factors that make this necessary.",
      "Closing the racecourse will support the development of a northern economic hub known as Woodlands Regional Centre, a plan that had already been articulated in the Housing Board\u2019s (HDB) 2017 Remaking Our Heartland programme.",
      "Such efforts to create regional business hubs are also part of the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)\u2019s \u201cLocal Hubs, Global Gateways\u201d strategy which aims to provide more commercial space outside the Central Business District (CBD).",
      "According to real estate consultancy Knight Frank, office rents in the CBD rose in the first quarter of 2023, driven by a combination of tight supply and strong demand.",
      "Singapore is also facing high demand for housing, which has translated into rising home prices and rents. In the first quarter of 2023, private home prices rose by 3.3 per cent while those of resale HDB flats rose by 0.9 per cent.",
      "As the space needs of Singapore\u2019s residents and its industries continue to grow, it will become necessary to redevelop existing sites to build more housing estates, innovation parks, satellite business districts and other projects.",
      "Besides driving urban redevelopment, the URA is also in charge of conserving historically significant buildings. According to the authority, conservation requires an appreciation and understanding of the architecture and structure of historic buildings, with the aim of retaining their inherent spirit and original ambience.",
      "Considerations for whether to conserve a building therefore involve the historical significance of the building, its architectural merit, as well as the original ambience of the building.",
      "The recent gazetting of Golden Mile Complex as a conserved building is a good case in point, given its post-independence modernist Brutalist style of architecture and popularity as a mixed-use development.",
      "However, given Singapore\u2019s land constraints and urgent land-use needs, it will be increasingly difficult to justify the conservation of buildings and facilities that occupy large plots of land.",
      "At 120ha, the Kranji Turf Club is almost four times the size of Dover Forest (33ha) and more than double the size of Keppel Club (48ha). Both of those sites have been slated for redevelopment into housing estates.",
      "While critics of the Dover Forest redevelopment suggested building flats on existing vacant sites, housing estates are in reality developed as an integrated whole.",
      "This means that housing estates need to include not only homes but also transport infrastructure, schools, markets, food outlets and medical facilities, requiring large plots of land rather than random pockets of space.",
      "The impetus for the Turf Club\u2019s closure is also related to a broader decline of interest in horse racing.",
      "According to a report from The Economist, horse racing viewership and attendance have been decreasing rapidly in the United States, pushed by declining interest in the sport as well as the proliferation of alternative gambling venues like casinos.",
      "In Singapore, horse racing average attendance has fallen from 6,000 per day in 2019 to current levels of 2,600 per day.",
      "Beyond its size, a racecourse is also a highly specialised facility that is designed to provide space for the care, training and racing of horses.",
      "At the Singapore Turf Club, there are multiple tracks for different race types and training purposes, racing and resting stables to accommodate horses, and an equine pool for training purposes. There are also a grandstand and carparks for accommodating spectators on race days.",
      "It will not be easy to convert such facilities for residential and commercial uses, nor will it be an optimal use of space and resources.",
      "It is possible that for the same reasons, other countries have considered closure of their horse racing tracks.",
      "In India, there is an ongoing debate about converting Mumbai\u2019s Mahalaxmi Race Course into a central park.",
      "In the United Kingdom, the Folkestone Racecourse in the county of Kent was closed in 2012 and recently approved for redevelopment into Otterpool Park Garden Town. This is a sustainability-focused town development that will provide housing, business premises and recreational facilities.",
      "In both instances, the demolishment (or proposed demolishment) of a racecourse frees up space for building homes and green spaces.",
      "In cases where large sports venues are conserved in the past, these often involved sports that continue to enjoy strong interest and viewership.",
      "Such venues include Berlin\u2019s Olympiastadion, which was a stadium built for the 1936 summer Olympics that is now used for international football matches.",
      "In Athens, there is the Panathenaic Stadium which was built around 330 BC. It has gone through refurbishments over the course of its history and remains in use as an Olympics venue.",
      "Given space constraints, Singapore will often face difficult trade-offs between urban redevelopment and conservation.",
      "This is further complicated by the fact that both are emotionally charged issues that matter a great deal to many.",

      "But effective urban planning is necessary to ensure that the nation\u2019s land use needs are met. This often requires our urban planners to redevelop existing plots of land to create space for new developments.",
      "What are the key considerations that determine which buildings or sites are to be conserved and which are to be redeveloped? How can our urban planners continue to ensure that Singapore\u2019s land use needs are fulfilled while at the same time retaining our heritage?",
      "This ongoing tension arose again with recent announcements that the Singapore Turf Club would cease its racing operations at Kranji. The 120ha Kranji site will be returned to the Government and redeveloped for housing and other needs.",
      "The move will free up much-needed land to address our urgent needs for more housing and commercial spaces.",
      "Considering the 180-year history of horse racing in Singapore, it is by no means an easy decision. But there are several factors that make this necessary.",
      "Closing the racecourse will support the development of a northern economic hub known as Woodlands Regional Centre, a plan that had already been articulated in the Housing Board\u2019s (HDB) 2017 Remaking Our Heartland programme.",
      "Such efforts to create regional business hubs are also part of the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)\u2019s \u201cLocal Hubs, Global Gateways\u201d strategy which aims to provide more commercial space outside the Central Business District (CBD).",
      "According to real estate consultancy Knight Frank, office rents in the CBD rose in the first quarter of 2023, driven by a combination of tight supply and strong demand.",
      "Singapore is also facing high demand for housing, which has translated into rising home prices and rents. In the first quarter of 2023, private home prices rose by 3.3 per cent while those of resale HDB flats rose by 0.9 per cent.",
      "As the space needs of Singapore\u2019s residents and its industries continue to grow, it will become necessary to redevelop existing sites to build more housing estates, innovation parks, satellite business districts and other projects.",
      "Besides driving urban redevelopment, the URA is also in charge of conserving historically significant buildings. According to the authority, conservation requires an appreciation and understanding of the architecture and structure of historic buildings, with the aim of retaining their inherent spirit and original ambience.",
      "Considerations for whether to conserve a building therefore involve the historical significance of the building, its architectural merit, as well as the original ambience of the building.",
      "The recent gazetting of Golden Mile Complex as a conserved building is a good case in point, given its post-independence modernist Brutalist style of architecture and popularity as a mixed-use development.",
      "However, given Singapore\u2019s land constraints and urgent land-use needs, it will be increasingly difficult to justify the conservation of buildings and facilities that occupy large plots of land.",
      "At 120ha, the Kranji Turf Club is almost four times the size of Dover Forest (33ha) and more than double the size of Keppel Club (48ha). Both of those sites have been slated for redevelopment into housing estates.",
      "While critics of the Dover Forest redevelopment suggested building flats on existing vacant sites, housing estates are in reality developed as an integrated whole.",
      "This means that housing estates need to include not only homes but also transport infrastructure, schools, markets, food outlets and medical facilities, requiring large plots of land rather than random pockets of space.",
      "The impetus for the Turf Club\u2019s closure is also related to a broader decline of interest in horse racing.",
      "According to a report from The Economist, horse racing viewership and attendance have been decreasing rapidly in the United States, pushed by declining interest in the sport as well as the proliferation of alternative gambling venues like casinos.",
      "In Singapore, horse racing average attendance has fallen from 6,000 per day in 2019 to current levels of 2,600 per day.",
      "Beyond its size, a racecourse is also a highly specialised facility that is designed to provide space for the care, training and racing of horses.",
      "At the Singapore Turf Club, there are multiple tracks for different race types and training purposes, racing and resting stables to accommodate horses, and an equine pool for training purposes. There are also a grandstand and carparks for accommodating spectators on race days.",
      "It will not be easy to convert such facilities for residential and commercial uses, nor will it be an optimal use of space and resources.",
      "It is possible that for the same reasons, other countries have considered closure of their horse racing tracks.",
      "In India, there is an ongoing debate about converting Mumbai\u2019s Mahalaxmi Race Course into a central park.",
      "In the United Kingdom, the Folkestone Racecourse in the county of Kent was closed in 2012 and recently approved for redevelopment into Otterpool Park Garden Town. This is a sustainability-focused town development that will provide housing, business premises and recreational facilities.",
      "In both instances, the demolishment (or proposed demolishment) of a racecourse frees up space for building homes and green spaces.",
      "In cases where large sports venues are conserved in the past, these often involved sports that continue to enjoy strong interest and viewership.",
      "Such venues include Berlin\u2019s Olympiastadion, which was a stadium built for the 1936 summer Olympics that is now used for international football matches.",
      "In Athens, there is the Panathenaic Stadium which was built around 330 BC. It has gone through refurbishments over the course of its history and remains in use as an Olympics venue.",
      "Given space constraints, Singapore will often face difficult trade-offs between urban redevelopment and conservation.",
      "This is further complicated by the fact that both are emotionally charged issues that matter a great deal to many.",
      "While it is important to conserve buildings and spaces that hold special meaning or memories for their users, there is also an urgent need to ensure sufficient housing and commercial spaces.",

      "What are the key considerations that determine which buildings or sites are to be conserved and which are to be redeveloped? How can our urban planners continue to ensure that Singapore\u2019s land use needs are fulfilled while at the same time retaining our heritage?",
      "This ongoing tension arose again with recent announcements that the Singapore Turf Club would cease its racing operations at Kranji. The 120ha Kranji site will be returned to the Government and redeveloped for housing and other needs.",
      "The move will free up much-needed land to address our urgent needs for more housing and commercial spaces.",
      "Considering the 180-year history of horse racing in Singapore, it is by no means an easy decision. But there are several factors that make this necessary.",
      "Closing the racecourse will support the development of a northern economic hub known as Woodlands Regional Centre, a plan that had already been articulated in the Housing Board\u2019s (HDB) 2017 Remaking Our Heartland programme.",
      "Such efforts to create regional business hubs are also part of the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)\u2019s \u201cLocal Hubs, Global Gateways\u201d strategy which aims to provide more commercial space outside the Central Business District (CBD).",
      "According to real estate consultancy Knight Frank, office rents in the CBD rose in the first quarter of 2023, driven by a combination of tight supply and strong demand.",
      "Singapore is also facing high demand for housing, which has translated into rising home prices and rents. In the first quarter of 2023, private home prices rose by 3.3 per cent while those of resale HDB flats rose by 0.9 per cent.",
      "As the space needs of Singapore\u2019s residents and its industries continue to grow, it will become necessary to redevelop existing sites to build more housing estates, innovation parks, satellite business districts and other projects.",

According to the authority, conservation requires an appreciation and understanding of the architecture and structure of historic buildings, with the aim of retaining their inherent spirit and original ambience.",
      "Considerations for whether to conserve a building therefore involve the historical significance of the building, its architectural merit, as well as the original ambience of the building.",
      "The recent gazetting of Golden Mile Complex as a conserved building is a good case in point, given its post-independence modernist Brutalist style of architecture and popularity as a mixed-use development.",

      "While critics of the Dover Forest redevelopment suggested building flats on existing vacant sites, housing estates are in reality developed as an integrated whole.",
      "This means that housing estates need to include not only homes but also transport infrastructure, schools, markets, food outlets and medical facilities, requiring large plots of land rather than random pockets of space.",

      " The redevelopment of the Kranji train station is a significant opportunity for the authorities to improve the transportation infrastructure in the area. The station serves a large number of commuters and passengers, and its redevelopment can enhance the overall experience of traveling through the station. Here are three key claims to support this argument:",
      "1. The redevelopment of the Kranji train station can improve the accessibility of the station for commuters and passengers. This can be achieved by improving the station's physical infrastructure, such as the platforms and the concourse areas. By providing better accessibility, the station can become more user-friendly, which can lead to a more positive travel experience for commuters and passengers.",
      "2. The redevelopment of the Kranji train station can enhance the overall aesthetic of the station. By improving the station's physical infrastructure, it can become a more visually appealing and welcoming place for commuters and passengers. This can have a positive impact on the local community, as a more visually appealing station can contribute to the area's overall attractiveness and sense of place.",
      "3. The redevelopment of the Kranji train station can contribute to the overall economic development of the area. By improving the station's physical infrastructure, it can become a more efficient and effective transportation hub, which can attract more businesses and investment to the area. This can lead to the creation of new job opportunities and a more vibrant local economy."

      "Karen Tee\n",
      "A number of years ago, I remember excitedly anticipating a dinner reunion with a few of my teenage-era friends whom I had recently reconnected with. Back in the day, we were really close, sometimes egging each other on to defy our well-meaning teachers and then, when push came to shove, pulling all-nighters together to study for examinations.\n",
      "But when we finally met up again as adults, the chemistry had evaporated. I no longer found our shared jokes funny, and our updates about our respective life choices in the years since graduating struck me as mundane.\n",
      "The others likely felt the same way as none of us took the effort to initiate conversation or meet up again. It was to the best of my knowledge, a multi-way ghosting, with each of us abruptly cutting off communication without prior explanation.\n",
      "Having gone through the classic five stages of grief (denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance) when I was previously ghosted by an ex, I expected to feel at least a tinge of sadness at this unceremonious end to a once-cherished friendship circle. In fact, a recent study found that people often feel just as hurt at being ghosted by a friend as they do with a romantic partner.\n",
      "But surprisingly, I was unmoved by the entire experience. Instead, I felt a sense of relief that I had freed up time to focus on other things that I found more important without having to go through the whole rigmarole of explaining myself to someone else. They included work commitments and also nurturing new friendships with other people whom I felt a deeper connection with at that stage in life.\n",
      "Certainly, there is catharsis in wallowing in grief when losing a friend. Like with any other broken relationship, psychologists recommend taking time to express your emotions such as by journalling or indulging in a good cry, if you feel so inclined.\n",
      "Yet it is a reality that many friendships tend to fall by the wayside in our 30s and 40s. As Julie Beck, senior editor of the family section at The Atlantic observes, unlike the close-knit core friendships that those in their teens and 20s tend to forge and rely on, priorities change quite drastically later in life.\n",
      "Life happens. Marriage, childbirth and caring for elderly parents take centre stage, so it makes sense that platonic friendships, which are voluntary by nature, become less important.\n",
      "Certainly, we all probably have a personal story to share about friends who fell off the radar or stopped sending WhatsApp messages after they had kids. In this time-pressed world, who can blame them for not staying in contact, with other matters vying for their attention?\n",
      "This is why my preferred coping mechanism, which is also recommended by experts, is to reframe one\u2019s perspective. Instead of regarding a ghosted friendship as a deliberate rejection \u2013 which would be the case if a romantic partner did ghost you \u2013 simply tell yourself that life got in the way.

      "A number of years ago, I remember excitedly anticipating a dinner reunion with a few of my teenage-era friends whom I had recently reconnected with. Back in the day, we were really close, sometimes egging each other on to defy our well-meaning teachers and then, when push came to shove, pulling all-nighters together to study for examinations.\n",
      "But when we finally met up again as adults, the chemistry had evaporated. I no longer found our shared jokes funny, and our updates about our respective life choices in the years since graduating struck me as mundane.\n",
      "The others likely felt the same way as none of us took the effort to initiate conversation or meet up again. It was to the best of my knowledge, a multi-way ghosting, with each of us abruptly cutting off communication without prior explanation.\n",
      "Having gone through the classic five stages of grief (denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance) when I was previously ghosted by an ex, I expected to feel at least a tinge of sadness at this unceremonious end to a once-cherished friendship circle. In fact, a recent study found that people often feel just as hurt at being ghosted by a friend as they do with a romantic partner.\n",
      "But surprisingly, I was unmoved by the entire experience. Instead, I felt a sense of relief that I had freed up time to focus on other things that I found more important without having to go through the whole rigmarole of explaining myself to someone else. They included work commitments and also nurturing new friendships with other people whom I felt a deeper connection with at that stage in life.\n",
      "Certainly, there is catharsis in wallowing in grief when losing a friend. Like with any other broken relationship, psychologists recommend taking time to express your emotions such as by journalling or indulging in a good cry, if you feel so inclined.\n",
      "Yet it is a reality that many friendships tend to fall by the wayside in our 30s and 40s. As Julie Beck, senior editor of the family section at The Atlantic observes, unlike the close-knit core friendships that those in their teens and 20s tend to forge and rely on, priorities change quite drastically later in life.\n",
      "Life happens. Marriage, childbirth and caring for elderly parents take centre stage, so it makes sense that platonic friendships, which are voluntary by nature, become less important.\n",
      "Certainly, we all probably have a personal story to share about friends who fell off the radar or stopped sending WhatsApp messages after they had kids. In this time-pressed world, who can blame them for not staying in contact, with other matters vying for their attention?\n",
      "This is why my preferred coping mechanism, which is also recommended by experts, is to reframe one\u2019s perspective. Instead of regarding a ghosted friendship as a deliberate rejection \u2013 which would be the case if a romantic partner did ghost you \u2013 simply tell yourself that life got in the way. This way, there is no reason to behave like a jilted lover. Rather, I prefer to move on quickly with no drama and focus my headspace on other priorities instead.\n",

      "Karen Tee\n",
      "A number of years ago, I remember excitedly anticipating a dinner reunion with a few of my teenage-era friends whom I had recently reconnected with. Back in the day, we were really close, sometimes egging each other on to defy our well-meaning teachers and then, when push came to shove, pulling all-nighters together to study for examinations.\n",
      "But when we finally met up again as adults, the chemistry had evaporated. I no longer found our shared jokes funny, and our updates about our respective life choices in the years since graduating struck me as mundane.\n",
      "The others likely felt the same way as none of us took the effort to initiate conversation or meet up again. It was to the best of my knowledge, a multi-way ghosting, with each of us abruptly cutting off communication without prior explanation.\n",
      "Having gone through the classic five stages of grief (denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance) when I was previously ghosted by an ex, I expected to feel at least a tinge of sadness at this unceremonious end to a once-cherished friendship circle. In fact, a recent study found that people often feel just as hurt at being ghosted by a friend as they do with a romantic partner.\n",
      "But surprisingly, I was unmoved by the entire experience. Instead, I felt a sense of relief that I had freed up time to focus on other things that I found more important without having to go through the whole rigmarole of explaining myself to someone else. They included work commitments and also nurturing new friendships with other people whom I felt a deeper connection with at that stage in life.\n",
      "Certainly, there is catharsis in wallowing in grief when losing a friend. Like with any other broken relationship, psychologists recommend taking time to express your emotions such as by journalling or indulging in a good cry, if you feel so inclined.\n",
      "Yet it is a reality that many friendships tend to fall by the wayside in our 30s and 40s. As Julie Beck, senior editor of the family section at The Atlantic observes, unlike the close-knit core friendships that those in their teens and 20s tend to forge and rely on, priorities change quite drastically later in life.\n",
      "Life happens. Marriage, childbirth and caring for elderly parents take centre stage, so it makes sense that platonic friendships, which are voluntary by nature, become less important.\n",
      "Certainly, we all probably have a personal story to share about friends who fell off the radar or stopped sending WhatsApp messages after they had kids. In this time-pressed world, who can blame them for not staying in contact, with other matters vying for their attention?\n",
      "This is why my preferred coping mechanism, which is also recommended by experts, is to reframe one\u2019s perspective. Instead of regarding a ghosted friendship as a deliberate rejection \u2013 which would be the case if a romantic partner did ghost you \u2013 simply tell yourself that life got in the way. This way, there is no reason to behave like a jilted lover. Rather, I prefer to move on quickly with no drama and focus my headspace on other priorities instead.\n",
      "Still, it is true that friendships are integral to one\u2019s happiness. In the book Friends: Understanding The Power Of Our Most Important Relationships, psychologist and author Robin Dunbar writes that the quality of our friendships has a huge influence on our happiness, health and even mortality.\n",
      "Dunbar, who famously came up with the hypothesis that each individual typically has the bandwidth for 150 friends, also posits that it is one\u2019s inner circle of about 15 closer friends who will be there to offer emotional, physical and financial help in times of need.\n",
      "So, if anything, it is even more essential to cultivate and perhaps curate these friendships so that they align with one\u2019s priorities and needs at any given stage in life. Even now in my 30s, I see no reason why I should stop making new friends and often take the effort to attend social or networking events to connect with like-minded people.\n",
      "Unsentimental as it may sound, I am also clear-eyed when friends drift apart. Likewise, I do not begrudge formerly close friends when they decide they would rather devote precious spare time to nurturing other friendship groups that they feel closer to.\n",
      "In these cases, ghosting actually turns out to be a useful method for letting friendships melt away gently into the good night. Its very ambiguity, when one \u2013 or both \u2013 parties simply stop communicating without a farewell note, actually leaves the door open for a reconciliation in the future.\n",
      "Hence, when a recent WhatsApp group I am a part of erupted in a flurry of ongoing messages about children and pre-school options, I resisted the urge to abruptly leave the chat even though I have very little interest in baby talk. There was no reason to make others uncomfortable with an unannounced exit when they were exchanging notes on things that mattered to them.\n",
      "Instead, I did some ghosting of my own by archiving the chat so that my phone will not be inundated with message alerts. It is likely I will stay out of this chat group for as long as the discussions are all about child-related travails.\n",
      "But some day in the future, should the chatter drift towards a topic that catches my interest, I will take it as my cue to pick up where I last left off with a nonchalant, \u201cHello! Remember me?\u201d\n",
      "After all, I never really did \u201cbreak up\u201d with them, I just drifted away for a while.\n"

      "Gillian Tett\n",
      "Three weeks ago, the United States Treasury announced the launch of a new oversight committee called the Cloud Executive Steering Group.\n",
      "It received almost no public attention. No wonder: Compared with the explosive controversies around cryptocurrencies, ChatGPT or Europe\u2019s new drive to break up Google\u2019s dominance of adtech, cloud computing \u2013 the public and private data storage and processing platforms run by Big Tech vendors \u2013 sounds achingly dull. So much so, that most Americans view Amazon as \u201cjust\u201d an online retail giant, even though its cloud division now generates significant revenues.\n",
      "But investors and financial services consumers alike should wake up. For, as a report from the Treasury\u2019s little-known Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee (FBIIC) declared earlier in 2023, regulators are getting nervous about the systemic financial risks emanating from the cloud. Indeed, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) suggested in 2022 \u2013 echoing work by European central banks \u2013 that \u201cbig tech interdependencies\u201d have become \u201ca key policy blind spot\u201d.\n",
      "Thus, the crucial question for the Treasury\u2019s cloud committee \u2013 which includes both regulators and bankers such as PNC Financial Services chief executive Bill Demchak \u2013 is whether this \u201cblind spot\u201d can be corrected before a not-so-boring accident erupts.\n",
      "There are at least three big issues to consider. The first is the speed of change in computing practices. The FBIIC report notes that more than 90 per cent of the members of the American Bankers Association are shifting activity on to the cloud, although more than 80 per cent say this is at an early stage. Since a separate survey suggests that two-thirds of banks expect at least 30 per cent of their activities to be cloud-based in the next three years, the FBIIC calculates that cloud usage will triple by then. The pattern in Europe seems similar.\n",
      "Second, financial regulators are ill-equipped to handle this explosive growth. They have always struggled to track information technology, since they have historically hired economists, not techies. But when finance companies were running their own IT operations, regulators did at least have a mandate to watch them.\n",
      "However, the dash into the cloud places more of that activity in the hands of Big Tech vendors, who have never faced serious central bank scrutiny before. Some observers, such as BIS head Agustin Carstens, think that an overhaul is overdue, in order to extend the \u201cregulatory perimeter\u201d. Maybe so.\n",
      "But America\u2019s tech giants will fiercely resist efforts to put them under the purview of central banks or other financial regulators \u2013 and the White House currently shows little stomach for that battle. That leaves the cloud in a financial regulatory grey zone. \u201cDue to the different legal authorities for each agency, no single agency can see across the many use cases and the network of dependencies on cloud services within the financial sector,\u201d the FBIIC report observed. In plain English: This is a fog.\n",
      "Third, insofar as data is available, it seems that there are big, and growing, concentration risks. This might sound surprising. After all, one reason for financial groups to dash into the cloud is to reduce their reliance on costly, and potentially vulnerable, in-house data centres. A distributed model is supposed to be more resilient.\n",
      "But one bitter irony of finance is that innovations which purport to reduce risk by distributing it can sometimes also concentrate it in new, surprising and half-hidden ways. Consider credit. Before 2008, it was assumed that innovations such as securitised mortgage products would promote resilience by spreading default risk beyond banks.\n",
      "But when the 2008 crisis hit, it emerged that numerous players had quietly hedged their activities with the same entity \u2013 AIG Financial Products (AIGFP). That created a hidden \u201csingle point of failure\u201d, or Spof, to use an engineering term, and generated shocks when AIGFP wobbled.\n",
      "Cloud computing echoes this so-called Spof issue, as Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu told the BIS earlier in 2023. Most notably \u2013 and as Brussels often complains \u2013 the cloud is dominated by an oligopoly of Amazon, Microsoft and Google. If one of those players suffered a big cyber attack, weather-linked disruption or simply went bankrupt, that would rock the system.\n",
      "Big Tech executives insist this will not occur. You would hope so. And these huge companies are almost certainly better at handling cyber risks than banks\u2019 in-house teams. But the 2020 SolarWinds hack on Microsoft\u2019s cloud systems showed that nobody is infallible. So did the recent Ion saga and Capita data breach.\n",
      "And even without cyber risks, the commercial power wielded by this oligopoly is unnerving, particularly for Europeans. Indeed, Britain\u2019s Office of Communications, or Ofcom, has launched an investigation.\n",
      "So all eyes are now on the Treasury\u2019s Cloud Committee. Sadly, there are no easy solutions; or not unless the US government does something it seems unwilling or unable to contemplate \u2013 namely, break up Big Tech and/or impose tight government controls. But if nothing else, the issue shows that artificial intelligence is not the only tech topic that matters now. Maybe that Cloud Committee should ask ChatGPT how to defuse the Spof threat. The answer would probably be easier for Big Tech to swallow than asking Brussels. FINANCIAL TIMES\n"

      "Three weeks ago, the United States Treasury announced the launch of a new oversight committee called the Cloud Executive Steering Group.\n",
      "It received almost no public attention. No wonder: Compared with the explosive controversies around cryptocurrencies, ChatGPT or Europe\u2019s new drive to break up Google\u2019s dominance of adtech, cloud computing \u2013 the public and private data storage and processing platforms run by Big Tech vendors \u2013 sounds achingly dull. So much so, that most Americans view Amazon as \u201cjust\u201d an online retail giant, even though its cloud division now generates significant revenues.\n",
      "But investors and financial services consumers alike should wake up. For, as a report from the Treasury\u2019s little-known Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee (FBIIC) declared earlier in 2023, regulators are getting nervous about the systemic financial risks emanating from the cloud. Indeed, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) suggested in 2022 \u2013 echoing work by European central banks \u2013 that \u201cbig tech interdependencies\u201d have become \u201ca key policy blind spot\u201d.\n",
      "Thus, the crucial question for the Treasury\u2019s cloud committee \u2013 which includes both regulators and bankers such as PNC Financial Services chief executive Bill Demchak \u2013 is whether this \u201cblind spot\u201d can be corrected before a not-so-boring accident erupts.\n",
      "There are at least three big issues to consider. The first is the speed of change in computing practices. The FBIIC report notes that more than 90 per cent of the members of the American Bankers Association are shifting activity on to the cloud, although more than 80 per cent say this is at an early stage. Since a separate survey suggests that two-thirds of banks expect at least 30 per cent of their activities to be cloud-based in the next three years, the FBIIC calculates that cloud usage will triple by then. The pattern in Europe seems similar.\n",
      "Second, financial regulators are ill-equipped to handle this explosive growth. They have always struggled to track information technology, since they have historically hired economists, not techies. But when finance companies were running their own IT operations, regulators did at least have a mandate to watch them.\n",
      "However, the dash into the cloud places more of that activity in the hands of Big Tech vendors, who have never faced serious central bank scrutiny before. Some observers, such as BIS head Agustin Carstens, think that an overhaul is overdue, in order to extend the \u201cregulatory perimeter\u201d. Maybe so.\n",
      "But America\u2019s tech giants will fiercely resist efforts to put them under the purview of central banks or other financial regulators \u2013 and the White House currently shows little stomach for that battle. That leaves the cloud in a financial regulatory grey zone. \u201cDue to the different legal authorities for each agency, no single agency can see across the many use cases and the network of dependencies on cloud services within the financial sector,\u201d the FBIIC report observed. In plain English: This is a fog.\n",
      "Third, insofar as data is available, it seems that there are big, and growing, concentration risks. This might sound surprising. After all, one reason for financial groups to dash into the cloud is to reduce their reliance on costly, and potentially vulnerable, in-house data centres. A distributed model is supposed to be more resilient.\n",
      "But one bitter irony of finance is that innovations which purport to reduce risk by distributing it can sometimes also concentrate it in new, surprising and half-hidden ways. Consider credit. Before 2008, it was assumed that innovations such as securitised mortgage products would promote resilience by spreading default risk beyond banks.\n",
      "But when the 2008 crisis hit, it emerged that numerous players had quietly hedged their activities with the same entity \u2013 AIG Financial Products (AIGFP). That created a hidden \u201csingle point of failure\u201d, or Spof, to use an engineering term, and generated shocks when AIGFP wobbled.\n",
      "Cloud computing echoes this so-called Spof issue, as Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu told the BIS earlier in 2023. Most notably \u2013 and as Brussels often complains \u2013 the cloud is dominated by an oligopoly of Amazon, Microsoft and Google. If one of those players suffered a big cyber attack, weather-linked disruption or simply went bankrupt, that would rock the system.\n",
      "Big Tech executives insist this will not occur. You would hope so. And these huge companies are almost certainly better at handling cyber risks than banks\u2019 in-house teams. But the 2020 SolarWinds hack on Microsoft\u2019s cloud systems showed that nobody is infallible. So did the recent Ion saga and Capita data breach.\n",
      "And even without cyber risks, the commercial power wielded by this oligopoly is unnerving, particularly for Europeans. Indeed, Britain\u2019s Office of Communications, or Ofcom, has launched an investigation.\n",
      "So all eyes are now on the Treasury\u2019s Cloud Committee. Sadly, there are no easy solutions; or not unless the US government does something it seems unwilling or unable to contemplate \u2013 namely, break up Big Tech and/or impose tight government controls. But if nothing else, the issue shows that artificial intelligence is not the only tech topic that matters now. Maybe that Cloud Committee should ask ChatGPT how to defuse the Spof threat. The answer would probably be easier for Big Tech to swallow than asking Brussels. FINANCIAL TIMES\n"

      "For more than a decade, the leadership of the World Bank has been riddled with controversy. The two most recent presidents, Dr Kim Jim Yong and Mr David Malpass, resigned before completing their full terms. Dr Kim, a physician who was appointed in 2012, presided over a chaotic reorganisation of the bank and lost the confidence of its staff, while Mr Malpass, a former Treasury department official from the Trump administration, was severely criticised by scientists, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and members of the US Congress for failing to address the climate crisis, and indeed, for being a climate denier.\n",
      "The World Bank now has a new president, Mr Ajay Banga, an American citizen of Indian origin. The United States is the largest shareholder of the World Bank and has always appointed its president, even though it has no formal mandate to do so.\n",
      "In recent years, developing countries \u2013 which make up the majority of the bank\u2019s clients \u2013 NGOs, former senior bank officials and even the bank\u2019s staff association have been lobbying for the bank to be led by someone other than an American male. One of their arguments is that since promoting development is the core mission of the bank, its leader should be drawn from among candidates from developing countries who have experience and expertise in tackling development-related challenges.\n",
      "The Biden administration has finessed the issue by choosing Mr Banga, who was born and educated in India, and has extensive international experience, having worked with multinational enterprises, including Nestle, Citibank, and more recently, Mastercard, where he was chief executive \u2013 at each of which, his achievements were impressive. As a consummate financial manager, a champion of diversity, a supporter of climate activism and well-versed in many of the challenges facing the developing world, he has been cautiously welcomed by the bank\u2019s stakeholders, notwithstanding the fact that he is yet another American male.\n",

      "Returns like this might seem simple, and often they are free for the consumer. But managing those returns can get costly for retailers, so much so that many returned items are simply thrown out.",
      "In 2022, returns cost retailers about US$816 billion (S$1.1 trillion) in lost sales. That is nearly as much as what the United States spent on public schools and almost twice the cost of returns in 2020. The return process, with transportation and packaging, also generated about 24 million tonnes of planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions in 2022.",

This step of the process costs the retailer money \u2013 66 per cent of the cost of a US$50 item by one estimate \u2013 and emits carbon dioxide as trucks and planes carry items hundreds of kilometres. The plastic, paper or cardboard from the return package becomes waste.",
      "Processing a return takes two to three times longer than initially shipping the item \u2013 it has to be unpacked, inspected, repacked and rerouted.

    "answer": [
      " Environmental Impact of Returns",
      "The returns process has a significant impact on the environment, as it involves the transportation of goods and the disposal of returned products. In terms of transportation, the returns process can contribute to carbon emissions, as products are often shipped across long distances to reach their destination. This can have a negative impact on the environment, as carbon emissions contribute to climate change and global warming.",
      "In addition to the environmental impact of transportation, the returns process can also have an impact on the disposal of returned products. Many products are not designed to be reused or recycled, which means that they may end up in landfills or incinerators. This can have a negative impact on the environment, as landfills and incinerators contribute to air and water pollution and can harm wildlife and ecosystems.",
      "To mitigate the environmental impact of returns, companies can implement strategies such as reducing the number of returns through improved product design and customer service. They can also increase the reuse and recycling of returned products by partnering with sustainability organizations or implementing their own in-house recycling programs. By taking these steps, companies can reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to a more sustainable future."

      "E-commerce may make shopping more convenient, but it has a dark side that most consumers never see.",
      "Say you order an electric toothbrush for Father\u2019s Day and two shirts for yourself from Amazon. You unpack your order and discover that the electric toothbrush will not charge, and only one shirt fits you. So, you decide to return the unwanted shirt and the electric toothbrush.",
      "Returns like this might seem simple, and often they are free for the consumer. But managing those returns can get costly for retailers, so much so that many returned items are simply thrown out.",
      "In 2022, returns cost retailers about US$816 billion (S$1.1 trillion) in lost sales. That is nearly as much as what the United States spent on public schools and almost twice the cost of returns in 2020. The return process, with transportation and packaging, also generated about 24 million tonnes of planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions in 2022.",
      "Together, costs and emissions create a sustainability problem for retailers and the planet.",
      "As a supply chain management researcher, I follow developments in retail logistics. Let\u2019s take a closer look inside the black box of product returns.",
      "So, you repackaged your unwanted shirt and the electric toothbrush and drove them to UPS, which has an agreement with Amazon for free returns. Now what?",
      "UPS transports those items to the retailer\u2019s warehouses dedicated to processing returns. This step of the process costs the retailer money \u2013 66 per cent of the cost of a US$50 item by one estimate \u2013 and emits carbon dioxide as trucks and planes carry items hundreds of kilometres. The plastic, paper or cardboard from the return package becomes waste.",
      "Processing a return takes two to three times longer than initially shipping the item \u2013 it has to be unpacked, inspected, repacked and rerouted. That adds more to the cost to the company, especially in a tight labour market. Workers have to manually unpack the items, inspect them and, based on the return reason, decide what will happen next.",
      "If a warehouse worker decides the shirt in our example can be resold, the shirt will be repackaged and sent to another warehouse.",
      "Once another consumer orders the shirt, it will be ready to be packed and shipped.",
      "In-store returns can significantly cut warehouse and transportation costs, but driving to a bricks-and-mortar store might not be convenient for the consumer. Only about a quarter of online purchases are returned in person to the store.",
      "If the item is defective, like the electric toothbrush in our example, the warehouse worker might send it back to the manufacturer for fixing and refurbishing. It would be repackaged and loaded on a truck and possibly a plane to be sent to the manufacturer, leading to more carbon dioxide emissions.",
      "If the electric toothbrush can be repaired, the refurbished product is ready to be sold into the consumer market again \u2013 often at a lower price.",
      "Refurbishing returned products helps to achieve a closed-loop supply chain where products are reused rather than disposed of as waste, making the process more sustainable than buying a new item.",
      "Sometimes, however, repairs cost more than the product can be resold for. When it is more expensive to restock or refurbish a product, it may be cheaper for the retailer to throw the item away.",
      "If the company cannot resell the shirt or refurbish the electric toothbrush economically, the outlook for these items is grim. Some are sold in bulk to discount stores. Often, returned products simply end up in landfills, sometimes overseas.",
      "In 2019, about 2.3 million tonnes of waste from returns were sent to landfills, according to an estimate by return technology platform Optoro. By 2022, the estimated waste had more than doubled to about 4.74 million tonnes.",
      "In the past, customers who wanted to return items by mail were often expected to do so on their own dime. That changed after Amazon began offering free returns and providing easy-to-use drop-off locations at UPS or Kohl\u2019s stores. Other retailers followed suit to compete, with many seeing free returns as a way to keep shoppers coming back.",
      "But that pendulum may be starting to swing back. The percentage of retailers charging to ship returns increased from 33 per cent to 41 per cent in 2022.",
      "Retailers are trying several other techniques to lower the return rate, waste and losses, which ultimately come back to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "Some retailers have shortened the return window, limited frequent returns, or stopped offering free returns.",
      "Other strategies include virtual dressing rooms and clearer fitting guides, which can help reduce clothing returns, as can high-quality photos and videos that reflect size and colour accurately.",

      "2. Contact the seller: If you are returning an item, contact the seller to inform them of your decision. You can do this by email, phone, or through the platform's messaging system.",
      "3. Package the item: Package the item in its original packaging or in a box that is sturdy enough to protect the item during shipping. Make sure the item is securely packaged, and include a copy of the receipt or proof of purchase.",
      "4. Ship the item: Once the item is packaged, ship it back to the seller. Make sure to use a trackable shipping method, as this will help ensure that the item is delivered safely and promptly.",
      "5. Receive a refund: Once the seller receives the item, they will process the refund. The time frame for the refund will depend on the return policy. Make sure to keep all receipts and proof of purchase, as you may need these for your taxes.",
      "By following these steps, you can return an item with ease and get your money back or exchange the item for another one. It's important to read the return policy carefully before returning an item to avoid any confusion or misunderstandings."

    "question": "5. How does the cost of returns affect retailers?",
    "answer": [
      " The cost of returns for retailers can have a significant impact on their bottom line. On one hand, returns can be seen as a sign of customer dissatisfaction, which can damage the retailer's reputation. On the other hand, returns can also be seen as an opportunity to reduce inventory costs and improve the efficiency of the supply chain.",
      "Firstly, the cost of returns can lead to lost revenue for retailers. When customers return items, the retailer must typically issue a refund or exchange the item. This can result in a reduction in sales, as customers may be less likely to make a purchase if they know they can easily return the item. Additionally, retailers may also incur additional costs such as restocking fees or shipping costs associated with the return.",
      "Secondly, the cost of returns can also impact the retailer's inventory management. When customers return items, retailers must account for the cost of the returned item and any associated costs. This can lead to a reduction in the retailer's profit margin and can also lead to the retailer having to reduce the quantity of items in stock. This can lead to a decrease in the efficiency of the supply chain and can also lead to the retailer having to pay additional fees for holding excess inventory.",
      "Finally, the cost of returns can also impact the retailer's reputation. If customers perceive that the retailer has a high cost of returns, they may be less likely to make future purchases from the retailer. This can damage the retailer's reputation and make it more difficult for the retailer to attract new customers.",
      "In conclusion, the cost of returns can have a significant impact on retailers, it can lead to lost revenue, reduced inventory management, and damage to the retailer's reputation. Retailers must therefore carefully manage the cost of returns in order to maintain their profitability and competitiveness in the market."

      "2. Opt for sustainable products. By choosing products made from sustainable materials or with sustainable production practices, consumers can reduce the environmental impact of returns. For example, purchasing products made from recycled materials or products with biodegradable packaging can reduce the environmental impact of returns.",
      "3. Support companies with sustainable return policies.

      "It is extremely troubling that a recent study, conducted by Duke-NUS Medical School and the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), has suggested that anxiety and depression symptoms among people here could be costing Singapore nearly $16 billion a year, or about 2.9 per cent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product. This is so as a result of absenteeism, reduced productivity, and the use of healthcare resources. According to the researchers, this is the first study after the coronavirus pandemic that estimates the prevalence of, and quantifies the financial cost of, depression and anxiety symptoms among Singaporean adults. While the economic and social dislocation produced by Covid-19 expectedly produced a decline in mental health, what is worrying is that even the national recovery from that period of stress did not produce better results in the survey, which covered 5,725 Singaporeans above 21 years old between April and June 2022. Clearly, mental health is an issue that Singapore must grapple with urgently.",
      "The lesson to be drawn from the survey is the need to treat mental health on a par with physical health. Singapore possesses admirable assets by way of its hospitals, both public and private, its step-down care facilities, its polyclinics, its general practitioners, and its specialists. They cater to the physical well-being of residents in a way that justifies Singapore\u2019s reputation for First World healthcare. Mental health, too, is addressed by the IMH, private institutions and civil society organisations. However, the stigma attached traditionally to mental problems \u2013 in a way that does not affect those seeking medical care for physical ailments \u2013 deters many sufferers from seeking early and preventive care. As a result, they suffer in silence when there are avenues open for their treatment and rehabilitation. Some prefer to go into denial mode. Such attitudes should not exist in a mature society. People must understand that it is not morally reprehensible to be mentally unwell, any more than it is to be physically sick.",
      "It is reassuring that companies are stepping up efforts to help staff with mental health issues. Stress and burnout, to say nothing about anxiety and depression, are workplace ills that erode the human talent on which corporate success is based ultimately. Companies which treat staff under mental pressure with understanding and empathy are likely to have employees who are motivated because they feel valued. Sufferers, too, would come forward for help early because they would not fear being stigmatised by colleagues. More companies here are including mental wellness benefits in their corporate insurance coverage in a healthy sign of the times.",
      "Anxiety and depression are global problems that are taking a heavy toll on productivity. It is imperative in Singapore that family members, community organisations, care services and companies work together more closely to have a helping hand ready always for sufferers."

    "question": "1. What are the economic and social costs of anxiety and depression symptoms in Singapore?",
    "answer": [
      " The economic and social costs of anxiety and depression symptoms in Singapore are significant. These costs include direct healthcare expenditures, lost productivity, and decreased quality of life.",
      "Firstly, anxiety and depression symptoms can result in increased healthcare expenditures. Individuals with these conditions may require more frequent medical appointments, hospitalizations, and prescription medications, which can add up to significant healthcare costs. According to the National Mental Health Survey in 2010, individuals with depression and anxiety disorders in Singapore incurred an average of $3,000 in healthcare costs per year.",
      "Secondly, anxiety and depression symptoms can lead to decreased productivity in the workplace. Individuals with these conditions may experience decreased motivation, increased absenteeism, and poor work performance, which can negatively impact their employers and colleagues. According to a study conducted by the National University of Singapore, the total cost of lost productivity due to depression in Singapore is estimated to be $1.2 billion per year.",
      "Lastly, anxiety and depression symptoms can lead to decreased quality of life. Individuals with these conditions may experience emotional and physical distress, which can affect their ability to participate in social activities and maintain relationships. This can result in social isolation and decreased social support, which can further exacerbate their symptoms.",
      "In conclusion, the economic and social costs of anxiety and depression symptoms in Singapore are significant and require attention from policymakers, employers, and individuals. By promoting mental health awareness, providing early intervention and treatment, and creating supportive environments, we can reduce the burden of these conditions and improve the overall well-being of individuals in Singapore."

      "One claim is that the study highlights the significant financial burden of mental health conditions on the Singaporean society. The estimated cost of depression and anxiety symptoms in 2019 was SGD 4.6 billion, which is a significant amount of money that could be used to address other pressing social issues. This highlights the need for increased investment in mental health care to reduce the financial burden on the society.",

      "It is extremely troubling that a recent study, conducted by Duke-NUS Medical School and the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), has suggested that anxiety and depression symptoms among people here could be costing Singapore nearly $16 billion a year, or about 2.9 per cent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product. This is so as a result of absenteeism, reduced productivity, and the use of healthcare resources. According to the researchers, this is the first study after the coronavirus pandemic that estimates the prevalence of, and quantifies the financial cost of, depression and anxiety symptoms among Singaporean adults. While the economic and social dislocation produced by Covid-19 expectedly produced a decline in mental health, what is worrying is that even the national recovery from that period of stress did not produce better results in the survey, which covered 5,725 Singaporeans above 21 years old between April and June 2022. Clearly, mental health is an issue that Singapore must grapple with urgently.",
      "The lesson to be drawn from the survey is the need to treat mental health on a par with physical health. Singapore possesses admirable assets by way of its hospitals, both public and private, its step-down care facilities, its polyclinics, its general practitioners, and its specialists. They cater to the physical well-being of residents in a way that justifies Singapore\u2019s reputation for First World healthcare. Mental health, too, is addressed by the IMH, private institutions and civil society organisations. However, the stigma attached traditionally to mental problems \u2013 in a way that does not affect those seeking medical care for physical ailments \u2013 deters many sufferers from seeking early and preventive care. As a result, they suffer in silence when there are avenues open for their treatment and rehabilitation. Some prefer to go into denial mode. Such attitudes should not exist in a mature society. People must understand that it is not morally reprehensible to be mentally unwell, any more than it is to be physically sick.",
      "It is reassuring that companies are stepping up efforts to help staff with mental health issues. Stress and burnout, to say nothing about anxiety and depression, are workplace ills that erode the human talent on which corporate success is based ultimately. Companies which treat staff under mental pressure with understanding and empathy are likely to have employees who are motivated because they feel valued.

    "question": "3. What is the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in Singapore?",
    "answer": [
      " The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on mental health in Singapore. In a survey conducted by the Singapore Mental Health Alliance, it was found that 77% of Singaporeans reported feeling stressed due to the pandemic, with 46% reporting feeling anxious and 28% reporting feeling depressed. These feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression can have long-last of negative effects on an individual's mental health.",
      "One impact of the pandemic on mental health is the increased risk of mental health disorders. The prolonged lockdown and social distancing measures have led to a lack of social interaction and a decrease in daily activities, which can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness. This can increase the risk of developing mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety.",
      "Another impact of the pandemic on mental health is the financial strain it has put on many individuals and families. The economic downturn caused by the pandemic has led to job losses, reduced income, and increased costs of living, which can lead to financial stress and anxiety. This financial strain can further exacerbate existing mental health issues and increase the risk of developing new ones.",
      "In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on mental health in Singapore. The increased risk of mental health disorders and the financial strain caused by the pandemic can have long-lasting negative effects on an individual's mental health. It is important for individuals to seek support and resources to help manage these feelings and for governments to prioritize mental health in their response to the pandemic."

      "It is extremely troubling that a recent study, conducted by Duke-NUS Medical School and the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), has suggested that anxiety and depression symptoms among people here could be costing Singapore nearly $16 billion a year, or about 2.9 per cent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product. This is so as a result of absenteeism, reduced productivity, and the use of healthcare resources. According to the researchers, this is the first study after the coronavirus pandemic that estimates the prevalence of, and quantifies the financial cost of, depression and anxiety symptoms among Singaporean adults. While the economic and social dislocation produced by Covid-19 expectedly produced a decline in mental health, what is worrying is that even the national recovery from that period of stress did not produce better results in the survey, which covered 5,725 Singaporeans above 21 years old between April and June 2022. Clearly, mental health is an issue that Singapore must grapple with urgently.",
      "The lesson to be drawn from the survey is the need to treat mental health on a par with physical health. Singapore possesses admirable assets by way of its hospitals, both public and private, its step-down care facilities, its polyclinics, its general practitioners, and its specialists. They cater to the physical well-being of residents in a way that justifies Singapore\u2019s reputation for First World healthcare. Mental health, too, is addressed by the IMH, private institutions and civil society organisations. However, the stigma attached traditionally to mental problems \u2013 in a way that does not affect those seeking medical care for physical ailments \u2013 deters many sufferers from seeking early and preventive care.

      "For those who have followed the energy transition over the past few decades, there is one technology that is treated as much as a punchline as a serious industry: Carbon capture and storage, or CCS.",
      "A decade or so ago, many still thought it was the best hope for decarbonising the world\u2019s power systems. CCS was \u201cthe Google and Intel of the energy world\u201d, the Atlantic magazine declared in a 2010 cover story that predicted solar and wind would never get above 10 per cent of power supply.",
      "In the following decade, it was renewables that boomed while CCS went bust. Wind and solar accounted for 39 per cent of generation in Germany in the first quarter of 2023 and will hit 50 per cent over the full year in Spain. Meanwhile, only a handful of demonstration CCS plants went into operation \u2013 and one of the biggest was switched off in 2021 as oil prices plummeted, since it had been able to make money only from the decidedly dirty business of driving carbon dioxide into depleted oil wells to force out fresh crude.",
      "There are signs that CCS may be about to get the last laugh, though. In Britain, the government has promised as much as \u00a320 billion (S$33.9 billion) in spending to kick-start the sector. A tender to scope out sites that could store as much as 10 per cent of the country\u2019s emissions in old North Sea oilfields closed comfortably oversubscribed in May. In the Gulf of Mexico, ExxonMobil has spent about US$25 million (S$33.6 million) in two recent rounds bidding for nearly 170 blocks of depleted offshore acreage that might be able to store carbon from a planned hub in Houston, Texas. The world\u2019s first CCS project at a cement plant is slated to start in 2024 at a Heidelberg Materials facility in Norway.",
      "What\u2019s different now? In essence, a business that was always viable technologically has finally found an economic rationale. The problem with CCS was never that it did not work: Norway\u2019s Sleipner carbon capture project has been quietly pumping about 1 million tonnes annually under the North Sea for nearly 20 years since it was built to evade a 1991 carbon tax. Elsewhere in the world, however, there was no way to get paid.",
      "That has changed with the US Inflation Reduction Act and the surging value of the European Union\u2019s carbon permits. CCS does not really become viable anywhere south of US$70 a metric tonne, and until about 18 months ago the only countries putting a price on carbon at that level were in Scandinavia and the Alps.",
      "Since the start of 2022, however, European carbon has averaged US$89 a tonne, while the Biden administration\u2019s climate Bill has introduced an US$85/tonne tax credit for CCS. Roughly a third of the world economy has suddenly priced carbon dioxide (CO2) at a level where, in theory, there should be good money in locking it up underground.",
      "All the hype from the 2000s has cast a long shadow. CCS is still seen by many energy specialists as a pipe dream at best, and at worst a mendacious attempt to rebrand fossil fuels without doing the hard work of decarbonisation. The main end-use for which it was pitched a decade ago \u2013 power generation \u2013 has also been invalidated by the slumping costs of renewable power.",
      "Even if you exclude electricity, however, there is a big slice of industry where CCS could yet be crucial. Power generation accounts for about 40 per cent of the world\u2019s CO2 emissions, but another fifth comes from steel, cement and chemicals \u2013 and renewables are not well-suited to abating that pollution. Until technologies such as green steel and green hydrogen get up to speed and someone invents a viable way of making zero-carbon cement, we could use a functioning CCS sector to keep that CO2 out of the atmosphere.",
      "CCS has another benefit, too. The developed world\u2019s shift to a more aggressive decarbonisation pathway risks leaving many emerging economies stranded. Falling fossil fuel demand will kill off one of their main raw materials export industries, while carbon border taxes threaten future manufacturing sectors. A global carbon trade offers a solution to that problem, giving nations with the right geology the ability to make money from sequestering other people\u2019s carbon.",
      "In places, the carbon content of a barrel of oil is already worth more than the fuel. EU pricing for the emissions from heavy Canadian crude is currently about 25 per cent above the cost of the crude itself. That\u2019s potentially a revenue stream that oil-dependent nations in Africa and the Middle East could monetise.",
      "Governments should do everything they can to foster this trend \u2013 and to encourage China, attempting a crackdown on the heavy industries that account for more than half of its pollution, to lift its own anaemic US$8.24 a tonne carbon price to similar paradigm-changing levels.",

    "question": "1. What is carbon capture and storage (CCS) and how does it work?",
    "answer": [
      " Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a technology that captures carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from industrial processes and other sources, such as power plants, and stores them in underground geological formations or other storage sites. CCS is considered a crucial technology in the fight against climate change because it allows for the capture of CO2 emissions before they are released into the atmosphere, where they contribute to global warming.",
      "The process of CCS typically involves the following steps:",
      "1. Capture: The CO2 is captured from the emissions source using a variety of technologies, such as amine scrubbers, membrane separators, or biomimetic membranes.",
      "2. Transport: The captured CO2 is then transported to a storage site, typically through a pipeline.",
      "3. Storage: The CO2 is injected into underground geological formations, such as depleted oil and gas fields, unmineable coal seams, or saline aquifers. The CO2 is stored in a supercritical state, which allows it to be easily injected and retained in the formation.",
      "4. Monitoring: The stored CO2 is monitored to ensure that it remains securely stored and does not leak into the environment.",
      "Overall, CCS is a promising technology for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the impacts of climate change. However, it is still in the early stages of development and requires further research and investment to advance and scale up."

      "For those who have followed the energy transition over the past few decades, there is one technology that is treated as much as a punchline as a serious industry: Carbon capture and storage, or CCS.",
      "A decade or so ago, many still thought it was the best hope for decarbonising the world\u2019s power systems. CCS was \u201cthe Google and Intel of the energy world\u201d, the Atlantic magazine declared in a 2010 cover story that predicted solar and wind would never get above 10 per cent of power supply.",
      "In the following decade, it was renewables that boomed while CCS went bust. Wind and solar accounted for 39 per cent of generation in Germany in the first quarter of 2023 and will hit 50 per cent over the full year in Spain. Meanwhile, only a handful of demonstration CCS plants went into operation \u2013 and one of the biggest was switched off in 2021 as oil prices plummeted, since it had been able to make money only from the decidedly dirty business of driving carbon dioxide into depleted oil wells to force out fresh crude.",
      "There are signs that CCS may be about to get the last laugh, though. In Britain, the government has promised as much as \u00a320 billion (S$33.9 billion) in spending to kick-start the sector. A tender to scope out sites that could store as much as 10 per cent of the country\u2019s emissions in old North Sea oilfields closed comfortably oversubscribed in May. In the Gulf of Mexico, ExxonMobil has spent about US$25 million (S$33.6 million) in two recent rounds bidding for nearly 170 blocks of depleted offshore acreage that might be able to store carbon from a planned hub in Houston, Texas. The world\u2019s first CCS project at a cement plant is slated to start in 2024 at a Heidelberg Materials facility in Norway.",
      "What\u2019s different now? In essence, a business that was always viable technologically has finally found an economic rationale. The problem with CCS was never that it did not work: Norway\u2019s Sleipner carbon capture project has been quietly pumping about 1 million tonnes annually under the North Sea for nearly 20 years since it was built to evade a 1991 carbon tax. Elsewhere in the world, however, there was no way to get paid.",
      "That has changed with the US Inflation Reduction Act and the surging value of the European Union\u2019s carbon permits. CCS does not really become viable anywhere south of US$70 a metric tonne, and until about 18 months ago the only countries putting a price on carbon at that level were in Scandinavia and the Alps.",
      "Since the start of 2022, however, European carbon has averaged US$89 a tonne, while the Biden administration\u2019s climate Bill has introduced an US$85/tonne tax credit for CCS. Roughly a third of the world economy has suddenly priced carbon dioxide (CO2) at a level where, in theory, there should be good money in locking it up underground.",
      "All the hype from the 2000s has cast a long shadow. CCS is still seen by many energy specialists as a pipe dream at best, and at worst a mendacious attempt to rebrand fossil fuels without doing the hard work of decarbonisation. The main end-use for which it was pitched a decade ago \u2013 power generation \u2013 has also been invalidated by the slumping costs of renewable power.",
      "Even if you exclude electricity, however, there is a big slice of industry where CCS could yet be crucial. Power generation accounts for about 40 per cent of the world\u2019s CO2 emissions, but another fifth comes from steel, cement and chemicals \u2013 and renewables are not well-suited to abating that pollution. Until technologies such as green steel and green hydrogen get up to speed and someone invents a viable way of making zero-carbon cement, we could use a functioning CCS sector to keep that CO2 out of the atmosphere.",
      "CCS has another benefit, too. The developed world\u2019s shift to a more aggressive decarbonisation pathway risks leaving many emerging economies stranded. Falling fossil fuel demand will kill off one of their main raw materials export industries, while carbon border taxes threaten future manufacturing sectors. A global carbon trade offers a solution to that problem, giving nations with the right geology the ability to make money from sequestering other people\u2019s carbon.",
      "In places, the carbon content of a barrel of oil is already worth more than the fuel. EU pricing for the emissions from heavy Canadian crude is currently about 25 per cent above the cost of the crude itself. That\u2019s potentially a revenue stream that oil-dependent nations in Africa and the Middle East could monetise.",

    "question": "2. Why was CCS once considered the best hope for decarbonizing the world's power systems?",
    "answer": [
      " CCS, or Carbon Capture and Storage, was once considered the best hope for decarbonizing the world's power systems due to its potential to reduce carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. The process involves capturing the carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and transporting them to a storage site, where they can be permanently sequestered.",
      "One claim could be that CCS was once considered the best hope for decarbonizing the world's power systems because it offered a way to reduce carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. This is because CCS allows for the capture of carbon dioxide emissions before they are released into the atmosphere, which can help to mitigate the effects of climate change. Additionally, CCS has the potential to reduce the overall carbon footprint of fossil fuel power plants, making it a promising solution for decarbonizing the power sector.",
      "Another claim could be that CCS was once considered the best hope for decarbonizing the world's power systems because it has the potential to provide a bridge to a low-carbon energy future. This is because CCS can be used in combination with other low-carbon technologies, such as renewable energy sources, to help transition towards a more sustainable energy system. Additionally, CCS can be used to extend the life of existing fossil fuel power plants, which can help to ensure a smooth transition to a low-carbon energy system.",
      "A third claim could be that CCS was once considered the best hope for decarbonizing the world's power systems because it offers a way to reduce the costs of decarbonization. This is because CCS can help to reduce the overall cost of decarbonization by capturing and storing carbon emissions, which can help to reduce the need for expensive carbon capture and storage technologies. Additionally, CCS can help to reduce the overall cost of renewable energy by providing a reliable source of energy when the sun is not shining or the wind is not blowing."

    "question": "3. How has the perception of CCS changed in recent years, and what factors have contributed to this change?",
    "answer": [
      " The perception of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) has undergone a significant change in recent years. This change can be attributed to several factors, including advancements in technology, increasing concerns about climate change, and the development of regulations and policies that support CCS.",
      "Firstly, advancements in CCS technology have led to a more efficient and effective capture of carbon dioxide. This has resulted in a more positive perception of CCS, as the technology is seen as more feasible and effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, the increasing concern about the impact of climate change has led to a greater awareness and appreciation of the importance of CCS in mitigating its effects.",
      "Secondly, the development of regulations and policies that support CCS has also contributed to the change in perception. For example, the Paris Agreement, which was signed by almost 200 countries in 2015, highlighted the importance of CCS in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. This has led to an increase in funding and support for CCS projects, which has further enhanced the positive perception of CCS.",
      "Lastly, the increasing cost-competitiveness of renewable energy sources has also contributed to the change in perception. As renewable energy sources such as wind and solar become more cost-effective, they are increasingly seen as a viable alternative to fossil fuels. However, this does not diminish the importance of CCS in the transition to a low-carbon economy. CCS can play a critical role in reducing emissions from industrial processes and enabling the continued use of fossil fuels while minimizing their environmental impact.",
      "In conclusion, the perception of CCS has changed significantly in recent years due to advancements in technology, increasing concerns about climate change, and the development of regulations and policies that support CCS. These factors have collectively contributed to a more positive perception of CCS as a critical tool in the transition to a low-carbon economy."

    "question": "4. What role could CCS play in reducing emissions from industries such as steel, cement, and chemicals?",
    "answer": [
      " CCS, or carbon capture and storage, has the potential to play a significant role in reducing emissions from industries such as steel, cement, and chemicals. One way CCS can be used is by capturing the carbon dioxide emissions produced by these industries and storing it underground. This can be done through a variety of methods, such as carbon capture and storage in geological formations or through direct air capture and compression.",
      "One potential benefit of using CCS in these industries is that it can help to reduce their overall carbon footprint. By capturing and storing the carbon dioxide emissions, these industries can significantly reduce their emissions, which can help to mitigate the impact of climate change. Additionally, by reducing their emissions, these industries may be able to reduce their costs and improve their competitiveness in the market.",
      "Another benefit of using CCS in these industries is that it can help to improve the sustainability of these industries. By reducing their carbon footprint, these industries can demonstrate their commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility, which can be important for their reputation and their ability to attract customers.",
      "Overall, CCS has the potential to play a significant role in reducing emissions from industries such as steel, cement, and chemicals. By capturing and storing the carbon dioxide emissions, these industries can significantly reduce their carbon footprint and improve their sustainability, which can help to mitigate the impact of climate change and improve their competitiveness in the market."
