      "Frederick Lim",
      "I never got to know my father well. He died suddenly when I was nine. He was only 44.",
      "Although I didn\u2019t have much time with him, I have fond memories of my boyhood days. And on Father\u2019s Day every year, I look at his photograph, say a little prayer for him, and thank him for all that he gave me during our brief time together.",
      "I grew up in Klang, a city in Selangor in Malaysia, where my father worked as a civil servant. After his death, my mother, older brother and I moved to Singapore where my uncle gave us a place to live. We lived modestly, with my father\u2019s government pension and financial help from my uncle. There was no money for extras.",
      "It was the absence of my father that marked my days back then. I missed how he doted on my brother and me, how he came home with presents and took us out to the movies. Most of all, I missed how he answered all our endless questions, which came easy for him as he had encyclopaedic knowledge.",
      "What I remember most are the lessons he taught me that have guided me throughout my growing-up years and shaped my personality.",
      "As a young boy, I took my father\u2019s words as gospel truth and the advice he gave as gold, holding them close to my heart.",
      "The biggest lesson has to be the \u201c272-steps lesson\u201d.",
      "When I was around six years old, our family visited the Batu Caves Hindu temple near Kuala Lumpur. The mouth of Batu Caves was at the top of numerous and steep steps. When my father said there were 272 steps, I told him I would not make it all the way to the top.",
      "His reply gave me the motivation to go for it: Getting to the top was just a matter of taking 16 steps to reach a landing, then another 16 steps to get to the next one, and if I kept going from one landing to another, I would reach the caves.",
      "And so we climbed \u2013 my father holding my hand and both of us counting the steps out loud until we reached the caves.",
      "The lesson learnt: Don\u2019t be daunted by a big problem, as it can be tackled by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts.",
      "I applied this lesson throughout my life \u2013 breaking a task into smaller steps, stages and sequences to eventually get it done. This approach to problem-solving has stood me in good stead in my personal and professional life.",
      "When I was 45, I made a mid-career switch from stockbroking to journalism, joining CNA as a business reporter. As I knew little about TV production, I applied what my father taught me \u2013 do things in steps, stages and sequences. In time, with training and learning on the job, I became a senior editor of the station\u2019s business programme.",
      "Another lesson I learnt from my father was foundation-building. I remember as a child stacking building blocks, putting a square or round piece on top of another to see how high I could build the tower before the whole structure came crashing down.",
      "My first few attempts collapsed in double-quick time. After seeing my failed attempts, my father showed me how I needed to build a strong foundation in order to get taller towers. I should not rush it, and take care to align the pieces to get a more stable structure.",
      "I followed his advice, and my towers stood tall and did not collapse.",
      "Building strong foundations became an integral part of everything I did in life. I was always well prepared before an examination, I trained hard before running a marathon, and I researched extensively before covering a news event.",
      "My father also made sure he built a strong foundation in the education of his two sons. When we turned three, he introduced us to the alphabet, taught us numbers and read books to us to build up our vocabulary. He made us do simple sums and memorise the multiplication table.",
      "On our family trips to other towns in Malaysia, my father would make us solve mental maths problems. To keep us occupied during the long drives, he asked us to work out how long it would take to get to the destination based on the speed of the car and the distance left to go.",
      "There were also memory games, such as naming the capital cities of countries and the dates of historical events.",
      "We went to the library regularly to borrow books, and he bought junior encyclopaedias to help us improve our general knowledge. He helped us with homework and reminded us to always go beyond what we learnt in school.",
      "I grew up loving books and studied English literature in school. I developed a passion for writing and published two novels.",
      "My father was a kind-hearted and generous man. He gave to charities readily and lent money to his cash-strapped colleagues. Our barber, who needed money for his family in India, borrowed from my father, who never asked for the loan to be repaid.",
      "He talked to us about faith, and most importantly, showed us through his actions the importance of living life with honesty and integrity.",
      "He told me never to take what was not mine at times when I found things. When I was a Scout in school, he reminded me during Job Week that I should do my best, as I was getting paid for the work. He told me he always gave his all, for the organisations he worked in and the people he worked with.",
      "Of course, my father had his weaknesses. He loved food too much, often overate and rarely exercised. As he was only in his 40s when he died from typhoid fever, I have always wondered if he could have recovered from the bacterial infection if he had taken better care of his health.",
      "My father could also be indecisive and lacked composure. I remember an incident when a beehive at the back of our house fell to the ground, and my father ran for cover from the swarm of bees. My mother\u2019s quick thinking in setting the hive on fire saved the day.",
      "Despite his shortcomings and his brief time with us, he had a lasting impact on our lives. I would like to think that he had a hand in the success story of my brother, who rose through the ranks to become a rear-admiral in the Singapore Navy and was Chief of Navy before he retired.",
      "Although I do not have children of my own, I do have advice for all the fathers out there \u2013 teach your children well, as what you say will leave an indelible impression and stay with them for the rest of their lives. Just like how my father\u2019s words and wise counsel have guided me through mine.",
      "So this Father\u2019s Day, I will gaze upon the photo of my dad, and thank him for making me who I am today."

      "I grew up in Klang, a city in Selangor in Malaysia, where my father worked as a civil servant. After his death, my mother, older brother and I moved to Singapore where my uncle gave us a place to live. We lived modestly, with my father\u2019s government pension and financial help from my uncle. There was no money for extras.",
      "It was the absence of my father that marked my days back then. I missed how he doted on my brother and me, how he came home with presents and took us out to the movies. Most of all, I missed how he answered all our endless questions, which came easy for him as he had encyclopaedic knowledge.",
      "What I remember most are the lessons he taught me that have guided me throughout my growing-up years and shaped my personality.",

      "When I was around six years old, our family visited the Batu Caves Hindu temple near Kuala Lumpur. The mouth of Batu Caves was at the top of numerous and steep steps. When my father said there were 272 steps, I told him I would not make it all the way to the top.",
      "His reply gave me the motivation to go for it: Getting to the top was just a matter of taking 16 steps to reach a landing, then another 16 steps to get to the next one, and if I kept going from one landing to another, I would reach the caves.",
      "And so we climbed \u2013 my father holding my hand and both of us counting the steps out loud until we reached the caves.",
      "The lesson learnt: Don\u2019t be daunted by a big problem, as it can be tackled by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts.",
      "I applied this lesson throughout my life \u2013 breaking a task into smaller steps, stages and sequences to eventually get it done. This approach to problem-solving has stood me in good stead in my personal and professional life.",
      "When I was 45, I made a mid-career switch from stockbroking to journalism, joining CNA as a business reporter. As I knew little about TV production, I applied what my father taught me \u2013 do things in steps, stages and sequences. In time, with training and learning on the job, I became a senior editor of the station\u2019s business programme.",
      "Another lesson I learnt from my father was foundation-building. I remember as a child stacking building blocks, putting a square or round piece on top of another to see how high I could build the tower before the whole structure came crashing down.",
      "My first few attempts collapsed in double-quick time. After seeing my failed attempts, my father showed me how I needed to build a strong foundation in order to get taller towers. I should not rush it, and take care to align the pieces to get a more stable structure.",

He told me he always gave his all, for the organisations he worked in and the people he worked with.",
      "Of course, my father had his weaknesses. He loved food too much, often overate and rarely exercised. As he was only in his 40s when he died from typhoid fever, I have always wondered if he could have recovered from the bacterial infection if he had taken better care of his health.",
      "My father could also be indecisive and lacked composure. I remember an incident when a beehive at the back of our house fell to the ground, and my father ran for cover from the swarm of bees. My mother\u2019s quick thinking in setting the hive on fire saved the day.",

      "Frederick Lim",
      "I never got to know my father well. He died suddenly when I was nine. He was only 44.",
      "Although I didn\u2019t have much time with him, I have fond memories of my boyhood days. And on Father\u2019s Day every year, I look at his photograph, say a little prayer for him, and thank him for all that he gave me during our brief time together.",
      "I grew up in Klang, a city in Selangor in Malaysia, where my father worked as a civil servant. After his death, my mother, older brother and I moved to Singapore where my uncle gave us a place to live. We lived modestly, with my father\u2019s government pension and financial help from my uncle. There was no money for extras.",
      "It was the absence of my father that marked my days back then. I missed how he doted on my brother and me, how he came home with presents and took us out to the movies. Most of all, I missed how he answered all our endless questions, which came easy for him as he had encyclopaedic knowledge.",
      "What I remember most are the lessons he taught me that have guided me throughout my growing-up years and shaped my personality.",
      "As a young boy, I took my father\u2019s words as gospel truth and the advice he gave as gold, holding them close to my heart.",
      "The biggest lesson has to be the \u201c272-steps lesson\u201d.",
      "When I was around six years old, our family visited the Batu Caves Hindu temple near Kuala Lumpur. The mouth of Batu Caves was at the top of numerous and steep steps. When my father said there were 272 steps, I told him I would not make it all the way to the top.",
      "His reply gave me the motivation to go for it: Getting to the top was just a matter of taking 16 steps to reach a landing, then another 16 steps to get to the next one, and if I kept going from one landing to another, I would reach the caves.",
      "And so we climbed \u2013 my father holding my hand and both of us counting the steps out loud until we reached the caves.",
      "The lesson learnt: Don\u2019t be daunted by a big problem, as it can be tackled by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts.",
      "I applied this lesson throughout my life \u2013 breaking a task into smaller steps, stages and sequences to eventually get it done. This approach to problem-solving has stood me in good stead in my personal and professional life.",
      "When I was 45, I made a mid-career switch from stockbroking to journalism, joining CNA as a business reporter. As I knew little about TV production, I applied what my father taught me \u2013 do things in steps, stages and sequences. In time, with training and learning on the job, I became a senior editor of the station\u2019s business programme.",
      "Another lesson I learnt from my father was foundation-building. I remember as a child stacking building blocks, putting a square or round piece on top of another to see how high I could build the tower before the whole structure came crashing down.",
      "My first few attempts collapsed in double-quick time. After seeing my failed attempts, my father showed me how I needed to build a strong foundation in order to get taller towers. I should not rush it, and take care to align the pieces to get a more stable structure.",
      "I followed his advice, and my towers stood tall and did not collapse.",
      "Building strong foundations became an integral part of everything I did in life. I was always well prepared before an examination, I trained hard before running a marathon, and I researched extensively before covering a news event.",
      "My father also made sure he built a strong foundation in the education of his two sons. When we turned three, he introduced us to the alphabet, taught us numbers and read books to us to build up our vocabulary. He made us do simple sums and memorise the multiplication table.",
      "On our family trips to other towns in Malaysia, my father would make us solve mental maths problems. To keep us occupied during the long drives, he asked us to work out how long it would take to get to the destination based on the speed of the car and the distance left to go.",
      "There were also memory games, such as naming the capital cities of countries and the dates of historical events.",
      "We went to the library regularly to borrow books, and he bought junior encyclopaedias to help us improve our general knowledge. He helped us with homework and reminded us to always go beyond what we learnt in school.",
      "I grew up loving books and studied English literature in school. I developed a passion for writing and published two novels.",
      "My father was a kind-hearted and generous man. He gave to charities readily and lent money to his cash-strapped colleagues. Our barber, who needed money for his family in India, borrowed from my father, who never asked for the loan to be repaid.",
      "He talked to us about faith, and most importantly, showed us through his actions the importance of living life with honesty and integrity.",
      "He told me never to take what was not mine at times when I found things. When I was a Scout in school, he reminded me during Job Week that I should do my best, as I was getting paid for the work. He told me he always gave his all, for the organisations he worked in and the people he worked with.",
      "Of course, my father had his weaknesses. He loved food too much, often overate and rarely exercised. As he was only in his 40s when he died from typhoid fever, I have always wondered if he could have recovered from the bacterial infection if he had taken better care of his health.",
      "My father could also be indecisive and lacked composure. I remember an incident when a beehive at the back of our house fell to the ground, and my father ran for cover from the swarm of bees. My mother\u2019s quick thinking in setting the hive on fire saved the day.",
      "Despite his shortcomings and his brief time with us, he had a lasting impact on our lives. I would like to think that he had a hand in the success story of my brother, who rose through the ranks to become a rear-admiral in the Singapore Navy and was Chief of Navy before he retired.",
      "Although I do not have children of my own, I do have advice for all the fathers out there \u2013 teach your children well, as what you say will leave an indelible impression and stay with them for the rest of their lives. Just like how my father\u2019s words and wise counsel have guided me through mine.",
      "So this Father\u2019s Day, I will gaze upon the photo of my dad, and thank him for making me who I am today."

      "\u201cMake sure to look your age.\u201d",
      "This was my friend\u2019s blunt advice to me when I told her I was gearing up for a fellowship interview a few weeks ago.",
      "Puzzled, I assured her that reporting assignments and previous internships had prepared me to dress formally and appropriately for the occasion.",
      "\u201cNo, not just that. Be sure not to appear \u2018too young\u2019, perhaps put your hair up and avoid pinks or pastels,\u201d she said, a suggestion I found somewhat amusing.",
      "My friend, who like me is petite and around 1.5m tall, had recently been told during an interview for an overseas posting that she was too young for the job despite having the eight years of experience asked for in the advertisement.",
      "While she could not know for certain why the company was not keen on her after the meeting, she felt it had to do with her appearance \u2013 that she was deemed unsuitable as she looked younger than her 30 years.",
      "Her experience got me thinking about the way employers may judge a candidate\u2019s eligibility for a job based on appearance. While looking well groomed and professional for an interview shows that the candidate is serious about the position, looking \u201ctoo young\u201d despite being competent is something beyond the control of millennials and Generation Z job seekers.",
      "While ageism is commonly associated with discrimination against older workers, \u201creverse ageism\u201d refers to the challenges of workers in their 20s and 30s who are hampered by age-specific stereotypes, such as being inexperienced and naive, that employers have of people of their age group.",
      "Reverse ageism is not new, but it has been in focus lately among younger employees in post-pandemic times, as many bemoan the disruptions to their career development, finances and life plans over the past three years.",
      "A study by the American Psychological Association in 2017 noted that younger employees actually experienced an equal or higher level of workplace discrimination than their older colleagues.",
      "A survey by the National Trades Union Congress\u2019 Employment and Employability Institute in 2019 looked at how millennials responded to stereotypes about their generation. While most agreed that millennials are prone to job-hopping and are tech-savvy, they disputed the stereotypes that they are selfish and unable to take hardship or instructions from a superior.",
      "Some respondents said many millennials faced challenges that were different from and, in some cases, worse than those of the previous generation. These include degree inflation, a term referring to the declining value of degrees as more people have access to tertiary education; the constant need to recalibrate their skills to meet technological changes; and a longer trajectory to reach life milestones, like home or car ownership.",
      "Ageism, like other forms of discrimination, is intersectional \u2013 meaning age intertwines with other aspects of a person\u2019s identity, such as gender and economic status. Taken together, their disadvantages in the workforce increase.",
      "A 2021 review on reverse ageism published on the American National Institutes of Health\u2019s website noted that compared with their male peers, there was significant discrimination against younger women applying for highly skilled administrative jobs, reflecting the double whammy of both ageism and sexism in the workplace.",

    "question": "1. How does ageism affect job seekers in their 20s and 30s?",
    "answer": [
      "Ageism can have a significant impact on job seekers in their 20s and 30s, leading to a range of negative consequences. Firstly, ageism can limit opportun));' job opportunities by creating a bias against older job seekers. This bias can manifest in a number of ways, such as being overlooked for job opportunities in favor of younger candidates or being subjected to age-related stereotypes.",
      "Secondly, ageism can have a detrimental effect on job seekers' mental health and well-being. Job seekers in their 20s and 30s may feel pressure to conform to traditional ideas of youth and beauty, which can lead to feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt. This can have a negative impact on their overall well-being and can even lead to depression or anxiety.",
      "Finally, ageism can also have economic consequences for job seekers in their 20s and 30s. If they are unable to find a job, they may face financial difficulties and struggle to support themselves and their families. This can have long-term implications for their future financial stability and can even limit their ability to achieve their career goals.",
      "Overall, ageism can have a range of negative consequences for job seekers in their 20s and 30s, limiting their job opportunities, impacting their mental health and well-being, and limiting their economic prospects."

    "question": "3. How has the pandemic affected the way younger people view their careers?",
    "answer": [
      "The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the way younger people view their careers. Firstly, the pandemic has led to an increase in the number of job losses, particularly in the manufacturing and retail sectors. This has made younger people more aware of the importance of having a stable and secure job, and they have become more cautious about the industries they choose to work in.",
      "Secondly, the pandemic has also highlighted the importance of remote work and digital skills. With the increase in remote work and virtual meetings, younger people have become more aware of the importance of developing digital skills and have started to explore opportunities in fields such as IT and software development.",
      "Lastly, the pandemic has also led to a change in the way younger people view work-life balance. With the increased demand for remote work, younger people have become more aware of the importance of work-life balance and have started to prioritize their mental and physical health. This has led to an increase in the number of younger people seeking careers in fields such as healthcare and wellness.",

Younger employees often lack the necessary skills and knowledge to perform their job effectively.

Additionally, younger employees may struggle to adapt to the company culture and work environment, which can create tension and conflicts with their colleagues and supervisors.",

      "A survey by the National Trades Union Congress\u2019 Employment and Employability Institute in 2019 looked at how millennials responded to stereotypes about their generation. While most agreed that millennials are prone to job-hopping and are tech-savvy, they disputed the stereotypes that they are selfish and unable to take hardship or instructions from a superior.",
      "Some respondents said many millennials faced challenges that were different from and, in some cases, worse than those of the previous generation. These include degree inflation, a term referring to the declining value of degrees as more people have access to tertiary education; the constant need to recalibrate their skills to meet technological changes; and a longer trajectory to reach life milestones, like home or car ownership.",
      "Ageism, like other forms of discrimination, is intersectional \u2013 meaning age intertwines with other aspects of a person\u2019s identity, such as gender and economic status. Taken together, their disadvantages in the workforce increase.",
      "A 2021 review on reverse ageism published on the American National Institutes of Health\u2019s website noted that compared with their male peers, there was significant discrimination against younger women applying for highly skilled administrative jobs, reflecting the double whammy of both ageism and sexism in the workplace.",
      "Many of these findings made me realise that the conventional idea of how to look and act at different ages of our lives no longer applied to people of my generation and the generations to come.",
      "Add to this the fact that we are marrying and parenting later in life, and have different sets of responsibilities and priorities compared with previous generations, with many renting rather than owning housing, travelling significantly more than our predecessors, and pushing for more work-life balance.",
      "The years of living with Covid-19 have also affected the way we look and behave. For instance, a 2021 study in medical journal The Lancet found that the prevalence of smoking among young people had decreased at the global level by approximately 33 per cent over the past 30 years.",
      "There are fewer drinkers too. A report by the BBC in 2022 found that more young people were embracing being \u201csober curious\u201d \u2013 drinking less and choosing to socialise while being sober \u2013 as a result of fewer opportunities to socialise or drink during the pandemic.",
      "In terms of mental health, millennials, who were dubbed the \u201ctherapy generation\u201d by a 2019 Wall Street Journal article, are seeking help more often than the previous generations.",
      "Such lifestyle choices may continue to play an important part in how we age and the choices we make in the future.",
      "In her widely shared May 2023 article in British Vogue titled \u201cWhy do so many millennials look and seem so much younger than they are?\u201d, writer Daisy Jones looked at how millennials are ageing differently from their predecessors, partly because the norms surrounding age-specific lifestyles and clothing have changed.",
      "Jones interpreted being called \u201cyounger\u201d as not being taken seriously, despite her achievements and credentials.",
      "I have seen these changing norms in women who are juggling motherhood and their careers in ways others may deem unconventional.",
      "A relative in her mid-30s went on hiatus from full-time work after the birth of her first child a year ago and is considering a postgraduate degree while pregnant with her second child. In the meantime, she is doing remote project-based work that pays well.",
      "Given the disruptions, employers must act and workplace culture must change to tackle both forms of ageism when it comes to hiring, career progression and flexible working arrangements, in order to avoid generational conflict between younger and older workers.",
      "An article on job portal MyCareersFuture.sg noted that ageism at the workplace leads to a decrease in productivity and meritocracy, as the focus falls on workers\u2019 age rather than their skills and talents.",
      "One way to tackle reverse ageism is to provide more opportunities for older and younger employees to interact through mentoring and training programmes, to let them learn from and understand one another better.",
      "Another option is for companies to consciously recruit and build intergenerational teams to capitalise on the strengths of different age groups.",
      "Tapping young professionals\u2019 guilds and groups, as well as networking opportunities, will also allow young people to bank on a support network of peers to help them navigate their career paths.",
      "In future, safeguards against reverse ageism, which is often difficult to address, should also be reflected in national labour laws and company policies, such as moving away from looking at a candidate\u2019s years of experience to the quality of the experience, and instituting diverse hiring panels that value the inputs of both junior and senior employees.",
      "This will help foster greater inclusivity in the job market, so that workers with potential can focus more on the job than on how their appearance, lifestyle choices and personal views are perceived in the workplace."
    ],
    "question": "5. How can employers address ageism in the workplace?",
    "answer": [
      "Employers can address ageism in the workplace by implementing inclusive hiring practices, promoting age diversity, providing opportun automated citation",
      "1. Implementing inclusive hiring practices: Employers can avoid age bias in the hiring process by using objective criteria such as skills, qualifications, and experience. This can be achieved by removing age from resumes and application forms and conducting interviews based on merit.",
      "2. Promoting age diversity: Employers can promote age diversity by creating a workplace culture that values the contributions of employees of all ages. This can be achieved by promoting intergenerational collaboration, providing opportunities for mentorship and learning across generations, and recognizing the unique strengths and perspectives that each age group brings to the workplace.",
      "3. Providing opportunities for training and development: Employers can address ageism by providing opportunities for training and development that are available to all employees, regardless of age. This can help to ensure that employees of all ages have the skills and knowledge needed to perform their jobs effectively and can help to promote age diversity and inclusion in the workplace."

      "This will mean the end of the 180-year-old sport in Singapore and the loss of hundreds of jobs. It also leaves horse owners, jockeys and the horses themselves facing an uncertain future.",
      "Despite the sympathy for STC\u2019s employees, the 120ha of land freed up by the club\u2019s closure opens up many possibilities for other urgent land use requirements.",
      "Put simply, one key aim of land use planning is to use any given piece of land to bring the most benefits to the most people.",
      "With local horse racing experiencing declining spectatorship over the years, it makes sense to redevelop the land on which the STC sits to meet urgent housing demand, especially for public housing.",
      "The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has indicated that planning for the site will take two or three years. Beyond the housing, leisure and recreation uses already announced, it is too early to speculate what else might come up on the land.",
      "However, there are hints about how government agencies plan to approach the site.",
      "A spokesman for the URA has noted that Singapore\u2019s northern region as a whole is very \u201cgreen\u201d and that the authority would take the surrounding context into account.",
      "The surrounding physical context includes the Mandai Mangrove and Mudflat Nature Park to the north, and the Kranji Reservoir, Kranji Coastal Nature Park and Kranji Marshes to the north-east and east. The Rail Corridor is also just north of the STC site.",
      "Beyond physical factors, general attitudes towards greenery have evolved over the years.",
      "Indeed, it was reported earlier in June in The Straits Times that a study by the National University of Singapore (NUS) Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions quantified what I had long noticed among my own friends and acquaintances \u2013 that Singaporeans value views of greenery enough to pay a premium for them.",
      "This means we have moved beyond equating greenery only with formal parks or nature areas.",
      "The Rail Corridor, for example, is a green leisure and recreation space for daytime joggers and walkers, but also doubles as a route for cyclists going to work, and a linkway for wildlife connectivity at night.",
      "The Clementi Nature Corridor announced by the National Parks Board in July 2021 as an ecological connection between Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and the Southern Ridges, and the 400ha Sungei Buloh Nature Park Network, are emblematic of the Government\u2019s current science-based approach to managing the balance between nature conservation and development needs.",
      "In that regard, beyond parks and landscaped greenery, there could be an opportunity for incorporating nature corridors in any new town at the STC site to improve the ecological links between existing nature areas around Kranji.",
      "The recent NUS study also noted that the area of greenery per person within residential towns declined from 17.7 sq m to 13.7 sq m from 2008 to 2020. Given the premium we place on it, I believe most Singaporeans would welcome it if we could add to the amount of greenery in Singapore.",

      "Adaptive re-use of existing buildings was in the news recently when The Business Times reported London-based environmental engineer Patrick Bellew and Singapore building experts arguing that in terms of embodied carbon, it is not environmentally sustainable to demolish buildings and rebuild them.",
      "Embodied carbon refers to the greenhouse gases that are released when building materials are made, transported and assembled. According to Mr Bellew, even for \u201csuper green\u201d buildings, embodied carbon constitutes about 80 per cent of the carbon emissions in the first 50 years of a building\u2019s lifespan.",
      "In other words, no matter how environmentally sustainable a building is when operational, a lot of its carbon emissions had already been expended during its construction and early years.",
      "Adaptive re-use of existing buildings would help negate the excessive carbon emissions inherent in the demolish-and-rebuild model.",
      "With the STC now about 25 years old, its buildings are good candidates for adaptive re-use as they are unlikely to be near the end of their structural lifespan.",
      "In fact, there are precedents overseas of sporting stadiums being repurposed for housing and other uses.",
      "One example is the old Highbury stadium, the home of Arsenal Football Club for 93 years until 2006. The stadium was converted into apartments for the new Highbury Square development.",
      "In the American city of Indianapolis, the 80-year-old grandstand of the historic Bush baseball stadium was converted into an apartment complex known as Stadium Lofts, which opened in 2013.",

The employees who work in the club, including the stable hands, trainers, and administrative staff, will lose their jobs. The owners who have horses stabled at the club will also be affected as they will lose their stables and the income generated from the horses. The jockeys who rely on the club for employment will also face job losses.",
      "Furthermore, the closure of the Singapore Turf Club will have an impact on the horse racing industry as a whole. The club is a major player in the industry, and its closure will lead to a reduction in the number of horse racing events in Singapore. This will result in a loss of income for the industry, and the owners and trainers who rely on the income generated from horse racing will be affected.",
      "Overall, the closure of the Singapore Turf Club will have a significant impact on the lives of the employees, owners, jockeys, and horses involved in the industry. It is important for the government to consider the impact of the closure on the industry and the affected parties before making a decision."

      "The horse racing fraternity has reacted with dismay to the Government\u2019s recent decision to close the Singapore Turf Club (STC) in Kranji.",
      "This will mean the end of the 180-year-old sport in Singapore and the loss of hundreds of jobs. It also leaves horse owners, jockeys and the horses themselves facing an uncertain future.",
      "Despite the sympathy for STC\u2019s employees, the 120ha of land freed up by the club\u2019s closure opens up many possibilities for other urgent land use requirements.",
      "Put simply, one key aim of land use planning is to use any given piece of land to bring the most benefits to the most people.",
      "With local horse racing experiencing declining spectatorship over the years, it makes sense to redevelop the land on which the STC sits to meet urgent housing demand, especially for public housing.",
      "The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has indicated that planning for the site will take two or three years. Beyond the housing, leisure and recreation uses already announced, it is too early to speculate what else might come up on the land.",
      "However, there are hints about how government agencies plan to approach the site.",
      "A spokesman for the URA has noted that Singapore\u2019s northern region as a whole is very \u201cgreen\u201d and that the authority would take the surrounding context into account.",
      "The surrounding physical context includes the Mandai Mangrove and Mudflat Nature Park to the north, and the Kranji Reservoir, Kranji Coastal Nature Park and Kranji Marshes to the north-east and east. The Rail Corridor is also just north of the STC site.",
      "Beyond physical factors, general attitudes towards greenery have evolved over the years.",
      "Indeed, it was reported earlier in June in The Straits Times that a study by the National University of Singapore (NUS) Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions quantified what I had long noticed among my own friends and acquaintances \u2013 that Singaporeans value views of greenery enough to pay a premium for them.",
      "This means we have moved beyond equating greenery only with formal parks or nature areas.",
      "The Rail Corridor, for example, is a green leisure and recreation space for daytime joggers and walkers, but also doubles as a route for cyclists going to work, and a linkway for wildlife connectivity at night.",
      "The Clementi Nature Corridor announced by the National Parks Board in July 2021 as an ecological connection between Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and the Southern Ridges, and the 400ha Sungei Buloh Nature Park Network, are emblematic of the Government\u2019s current science-based approach to managing the balance between nature conservation and development needs.",
      "In that regard, beyond parks and landscaped greenery, there could be an opportunity for incorporating nature corridors in any new town at the STC site to improve the ecological links between existing nature areas around Kranji.",
      "The recent NUS study also noted that the area of greenery per person within residential towns declined from 17.7 sq m to 13.7 sq m from 2008 to 2020. Given the premium we place on it, I believe most Singaporeans would welcome it if we could add to the amount of greenery in Singapore.",
      "According to news reports, URA has not ruled out the possibility of retaining some STC structures if it makes sense to keep or repurpose them for other uses.",
      "Adaptive re-use of existing buildings was in the news recently when The Business Times reported London-based environmental engineer Patrick Bellew and Singapore building experts arguing that in terms of embodied carbon, it is not environmentally sustainable to demolish buildings and rebuild them.",
      "Embodied carbon refers to the greenhouse gases that are released when building materials are made, transported and assembled. According to Mr Bellew, even for \u201csuper green\u201d buildings, embodied carbon constitutes about 80 per cent of the carbon emissions in the first 50 years of a building\u2019s lifespan.",
      "In other words, no matter how environmentally sustainable a building is when operational, a lot of its carbon emissions had already been expended during its construction and early years.",
      "Adaptive re-use of existing buildings would help negate the excessive carbon emissions inherent in the demolish-and-rebuild model.",
      "With the STC now about 25 years old, its buildings are good candidates for adaptive re-use as they are unlikely to be near the end of their structural lifespan.",
      "In fact, there are precedents overseas of sporting stadiums being repurposed for housing and other uses.",
      "One example is the old Highbury stadium, the home of Arsenal Football Club for 93 years until 2006. The stadium was converted into apartments for the new Highbury Square development.",
      "In the American city of Indianapolis, the 80-year-old grandstand of the historic Bush baseball stadium was converted into an apartment complex known as Stadium Lofts, which opened in 2013.",
      "This, of course, does not necessarily mean that a different building, like STC\u2019s grandstand, can be similarly repurposed.",
      "Would retaining the grandstand unacceptably constrain the development potential and spatial planning of the rest of the site? Is the building suitable to be repurposed for the uses being considered, and would the effort be prohibitively expensive or too time-consuming to be practical?",
      "These are tough questions and hard economics, and pragmatism may render adaptive re-use of the grandstand unfeasible.",
      "However, there is value in considering the preservation of the intangible social memory of horse racing\u2019s long history in Singapore once it is gone, and honouring those who were part of it.",
      "If there is scope for adaptive re-use of the grandstand, one can imagine a day in the not-too-distant future when former STC employees or horse trainers could visit the lush and green new town and point out the repurposed grandstand to their children.",
      "Even with their illustrious sport gone, the building would be a meaningful legacy of Singapore\u2019s horse racing heritage, and the glory days of the Kranji racetrack.",
      "\u2022 Wee Jin Sin was an urban planner at the Urban Redevelopment Authority and an airport planner at the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore. He is now pursuing a graduate diploma in counselling psychology."

    "question": "3. What are some possible future uses for the land on which the STC sits?",
    "answer": [
      "1. Possible Future Uses for the STC Land:",
      "The land on which the South Taranaki College (STC) sits holds immense potential for future uses. Here are three possible future uses for the STC land:",
      "Claim 1: Develop a Sustainable Educational Park",
      "The STC land can be transformed into a sustainable educational park that combines education and recreation. The park can include eco-friendly facilities such as solar-powered buildings, water recycling systems, and green spaces for students to learn about sustainable practices. It can also provide a unique space for community events and outdoor activities, fostering a sense of community and engagement.",
      "Claim 2: Establish an Innovation and Technology Hub",
      "The STC land can be developed into an innovation and technology hub, focusing on emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and digital media. This hub can provide students with hands-on learning experiences, as well as opportunities for entrepreneurship and innovation. It can also attract businesses and start-ups, contributing to the local economy and fostering a culture of innovation.",
      "Claim 3: Create a Nature Preserve and Ecological Corridor",
      "The STC land can be conserved as a nature preserve and ecological corridor, preserving the area's natural beauty and biodiversity. This preserve can be connected to nearby conservation lands, creating a network of ecological corridors that allow wildlife to migrate and thrive. It can also serve as an educational resource for students, promoting environmental stewardship and appreciation for the natural world.",
      "In conclusion, the STC land holds vast potential for future uses that can benefit the community, promote sustainability, and foster innovation. A well-planned and executed development strategy can ensure that the land is put to its best use for generations to come."

Firstly, nature corridors can provide a pathway for wildlife to move between different areas of habitat, allowing for the preservation of genetic diversity and the prevention of inbreeding. This can be especially important in areas where human development has fragmented natural habitats, as it can help to reconnect isolated populations of animals.",
      "Secondly, nature corridors can also provide important habitat for a variety of species, including those that are threatened or endangered. By creating a network of connected habitats, the STC site can become an important source of biodiversity for the surrounding area, helping to support a diverse range of wildlife.",
      "Finally, incorporating nature corridors in any new town at the STC site can also have benefits for human communities. By preserving and enhancing natural habitats, the STC site can provide a range of ecosystem services, including clean air and water, pollination, and flood control. This can help to improve the overall quality of life for people living in the area, and can also contribute to the economic and social well-being of local communities.",
      "Overall, incorporating nature corridors in any new town at the STC site can play an important role in improving the ecological links between existing nature areas around Kranji, and can help to support a diverse range of wildlife and human communities."

      "The horse racing fraternity has reacted with dismay to the Government\u2019s recent decision to close the Singapore Turf Club (STC) in Kranji.",
      "This will mean the end of the 180-year-old sport in Singapore and the loss of hundreds of jobs. It also leaves horse owners, jockeys and the horses themselves facing an uncertain future.",
      "Despite the sympathy for STC\u2019s employees, the 120ha of land freed up by the club\u2019s closure opens up many possibilities for other urgent land use requirements.",
      "Put simply, one key aim of land use planning is to use any given piece of land to bring the most benefits to the most people.",
      "With local horse racing experiencing declining spectatorship over the years, it makes sense to redevelop the land on which the STC sits to meet urgent housing demand, especially for public housing.",
      "The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has indicated that planning for the site will take two or three years. Beyond the housing, leisure and recreation uses already announced, it is too early to speculate what else might come up on the land.",
      "However, there are hints about how government agencies plan to approach the site.",
      "A spokesman for the URA has noted that Singapore\u2019s northern region as a whole is very \u201cgreen\u201d and that the authority would take the surrounding context into account.",
      "The surrounding physical context includes the Mandai Mangrove and Mudflat Nature Park to the north, and the Kranji Reservoir, Kranji Coastal Nature Park and Kranji Marshes to the north-east and east. The Rail Corridor is also just north of the STC site.",
      "Beyond physical factors, general attitudes towards greenery have evolved over the years.",
      "Indeed, it was reported earlier in June in The Straits Times that a study by the National University of Singapore (NUS) Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions quantified what I had long noticed among my own friends and acquaintances \u2013 that Singaporeans value views of greenery enough to pay a premium for them.",
      "This means we have moved beyond equating greenery only with formal parks or nature areas.",
      "The Rail Corridor, for example, is a green leisure and recreation space for daytime joggers and walkers, but also doubles as a route for cyclists going to work, and a linkway for wildlife connectivity at night.",
      "The Clementi Nature Corridor announced by the National Parks Board in July 2021 as an ecological connection between Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and the Southern Ridges, and the 400ha Sungei Buloh Nature Park Network, are emblematic of the Government\u2019s current science-based approach to managing the balance between nature conservation and development needs.",
      "In that regard, beyond parks and landscaped greenery, there could be an opportunity for incorporating nature corridors in any new town at the STC site to improve the ecological links between existing nature areas around Kranji.",
      "The recent NUS study also noted that the area of greenery per person within residential towns declined from 17.7 sq m to 13.7 sq m from 2008 to 2020. Given the premium we place on it, I believe most Singaporeans would welcome it if we could add to the amount of greenery in Singapore.",
      "According to news reports, URA has not ruled out the possibility of retaining some STC structures if it makes sense to keep or repurpose them for other uses.",
      "Adaptive re-use of existing buildings was in the news recently when The Business Times reported London-based environmental engineer Patrick Bellew and Singapore building experts arguing that in terms of embodied carbon, it is not environmentally sustainable to demolish buildings and rebuild them.",
      "Embodied carbon refers to the greenhouse gases that are released when building materials are made, transported and assembled. According to Mr Bellew, even for \u201csuper green\u201d buildings, embodied carbon constitutes about 80 per cent of the carbon emissions in the first 50 years of a building\u2019s lifespan.",
      "In other words, no matter how environmentally sustainable a building is when operational, a lot of its carbon emissions had already been expended during its construction and early years.",
      "Adaptive re-use of existing buildings would help negate the excessive carbon emissions inherent in the demolish-and-rebuild model.",
      "With the STC now about 25 years old, its buildings are good candidates for adaptive re-use as they are unlikely to be near the end of their structural lifespan.",
      "In fact, there are precedents overseas of sporting stadiums being repurposed for housing and other uses.",
      "One example is the old Highbury stadium, the home of Arsenal Football Club for 93 years until 2006. The stadium was converted into apartments for the new Highbury Square development.",
      "In the American city of Indianapolis, the 80-year-old grandstand of the historic Bush baseball stadium was converted into an apartment complex known as Stadium Lofts, which opened in 2013.",
      "This, of course, does not necessarily mean that a different building, like STC\u2019s grandstand, can be similarly repurposed.",
      "Would retaining the grandstand unacceptably constrain the development potential and spatial planning of the rest of the site? Is the building suitable to be repurposed for the uses being considered, and would the effort be prohibitively expensive or too time-consuming to be practical?",
      "These are tough questions and hard economics, and pragmatism may render adaptive re-use of the grandstand unfeasible.",
      "However, there is value in considering the preservation of the intangible social memory of horse racing\u2019s long history in Singapore once it is gone, and honouring those who were part of it.",
      "If there is scope for adaptive re-use of the grandstand, one can imagine a day in the not-too-distant future when former STC employees or horse trainers could visit the lush and green new town and point out the repurposed grandstand to their children.",
      "Even with their illustrious sport gone, the building would be a meaningful legacy of Singapore\u2019s horse racing heritage, and the glory days of the Kranji racetrack.",

      "Additionally, retaining some of the STC structures can also provide a more efficient and cost-effective option compared to demolishing and rebuilding everything from scratch.",

      "Urban redevelopment can come into conflict with preserving heritage. In land-scarce Singapore, it is often inevitable.",
      "But effective urban planning is necessary to ensure that the nation\u2019s land use needs are met. This often requires our urban planners to redevelop existing plots of land to create space for new developments.",
      "What are the key considerations that determine which buildings or sites are to be conserved and which are to be redeveloped? How can our urban planners continue to ensure that Singapore\u2019s land use needs are fulfilled while at the same time retaining our heritage?",
      "This ongoing tension arose again with recent announcements that the Singapore Turf Club would cease its racing operations at Kranji. The 120ha Kranji site will be returned to the Government and redeveloped for housing and other needs.",
      "The move will free up much-needed land to address our urgent needs for more housing and commercial spaces.",
      "Considering the 180-year history of horse racing in Singapore, it is by no means an easy decision. But there are several factors that make this necessary.",
      "Closing the racecourse will support the development of a northern economic hub known as Woodlands Regional Centre, a plan that had already been articulated in the Housing Board\u2019s (HDB) 2017 Remaking Our Heartland programme.",
      "Such efforts to create regional business hubs are also part of the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)\u2019s \u201cLocal Hubs, Global Gateways\u201d strategy which aims to provide more commercial space outside the Central Business District (CBD).",
      "According to real estate consultancy Knight Frank, office rents in the CBD rose in the first quarter of 2023, driven by a combination of tight supply and strong demand.",
      "Singapore is also facing high demand for housing, which has translated into rising home prices and rents. In the first quarter of 2023, private home prices rose by 3.3 per cent while those of resale HDB flats rose by 0.9 per cent.",
      "As the space needs of Singapore\u2019s residents and its industries continue to grow, it will become necessary to redevelop existing sites to build more housing estates, innovation parks, satellite business districts and other projects.",
      "Besides driving urban redevelopment, the URA is also in charge of conserving historically significant buildings. According to the authority, conservation requires an appreciation and understanding of the architecture and structure of historic buildings, with the aim of retaining their inherent spirit and original ambience.",
      "Considerations for whether to conserve a building therefore involve the historical significance of the building, its architectural merit, as well as the original ambience of the building.",
      "The recent gazetting of Golden Mile Complex as a conserved building is a good case in point, given its post-independence modernist Brutalist style of architecture and popularity as a mixed-use development.",
      "However, given Singapore\u2019s land constraints and urgent land-use needs, it will be increasingly difficult to justify the conservation of buildings and facilities that occupy large plots of land.",
      "At 120ha, the Kranji Turf Club is almost four times the size of Dover Forest (33ha) and more than double the size of Keppel Club (48ha). Both of those sites have been slated for redevelopment into housing estates.",
      "While critics of the Dover Forest redevelopment suggested building flats on existing vacant sites, housing estates are in reality developed as an integrated whole.",
      "This means that housing estates need to include not only homes but also transport infrastructure, schools, markets, food outlets and medical facilities, requiring large plots of land rather than random pockets of space.",
      "The impetus for the Turf Club\u2019s closure is also related to a broader decline of interest in horse racing.",
      "According to a report from The Economist, horse racing viewership and attendance have been decreasing rapidly in the United States, pushed by declining interest in the sport as well as the proliferation of alternative gambling venues like casinos.",
      "In Singapore, horse racing average attendance has fallen from 6,000 per day in 2019 to current levels of 2,600 per day.",
      "Beyond its size, a racecourse is also a highly specialised facility that is designed to provide space for the care, training and racing of horses.",
      "At the Singapore Turf Club, there are multiple tracks for different race types and training purposes, racing and resting stables to accommodate horses, and an equine pool for training purposes. There are also a grandstand and carparks for accommodating spectators on race days.",
      "It will not be easy to convert such facilities for residential and commercial uses, nor will it be an optimal use of space and resources.",
      "It is possible that for the same reasons, other countries have considered closure of their horse racing tracks.",
      "In India, there is an ongoing debate about converting Mumbai\u2019s Mahalaxmi Race Course into a central park.",
      "In the United Kingdom, the Folkestone Racecourse in the county of Kent was closed in 2012 and recently approved for redevelopment into Otterpool Park Garden Town. This is a sustainability-focused town development that will provide housing, business premises and recreational facilities.",
      "In both instances, the demolishment (or proposed demolishment) of a racecourse frees up space for building homes and green spaces.",

      "1. Retain and incorporate heritage sites into urban planning:",
      "One way to ensure that Singapore's heritage is retained while fulfilling its land use needs is to incorporate heritage sites into urban planning. This can be done by preserving and restoring heritage sites, and incorporating them into the city's landscape. For example, the Bukit Timah Railway Station, which is a heritage site, can be incorporated into the surrounding urban planning as a cultural and historical landmark. This will not only preserve the heritage of the site but also add to the city's character and tourism appeal.",
      "2. Promote adaptive reuse of heritage sites:",
      "Another way to retain heritage sites while fulfilling land use needs is to promote adaptive reuse of heritage sites. This means finding new and creative ways to repurpose heritage sites for modern-day use while still preserving their historical and cultural significance. For example, the former Ford Factory in Jurong can be repurposed as a creative hub for designers and artists, while still preserving its industrial heritage. This approach allows for the continued use of the site while still preserving its heritage value.",
      "3. Incentivize private sector involvement in heritage preservation:",
      "The private sector can also play a role in preserving Singapore's heritage while fulfilling land use needs. One way to do this is to incentivize private sector involvement in heritage preservation. This can be done by offering tax breaks or other financial incentives to developers who incorporate heritage sites into their projects or restore heritage sites to their original state. This will encourage private sector involvement in preserving Singapore's heritage while also fulfilling land use needs."

    "question": "3. What is the role of the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) in the redevelopment process?",
    "answer": [
      "The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) plays a crucial role in the redevelopment process in Singapore. Firstly, the URA is responsible for identifying areas in Singapore that require redevelopment and determining the land use policies that will guide the redevelopment process. This involves conducting land use surveys and analysing population trends, economic conditions, and social needs to determine the most appropriate land use policies.",
      "Secondly, the URA works closely with the private sector to facilitate redevelopment projects. This includes providing financial incentives such as tax breaks and infrastructure grants to encourage private sector investment in redevelopment projects. The URA also provides technical support to developers to help them navigate the redevelopment process, including obtaining necessary permits and approvals from the relevant authorities.",
      "Finally, the URA plays a regulatory role in the redevelopment process. This involves setting guidelines and regulations for redevelopment projects to ensure that they are carried out in a sustainable and responsible manner. For example, the URA has set guidelines for the maximum height of buildings in certain areas of Singapore to ensure that they do not obstruct views and cause shading issues.",
      "In conclusion, the URA plays a crucial role in the redevelopment process in Singapore. By identifying areas in need of redevelopment, facilitating private sector investment, and regulating redevelopment projects, the URA helps to ensure that redevelopment projects are carried out in a sustainable and responsible manner."

    "question": "4. What is the \"Local Hubs, Global Gateways\" strategy?",
    "answer": [
      "The \"Local Hubs, Global Gateways\" strategy is a marketing approach adopted by Starbucks to expand its global presence while maintain kerbing the negative impacts of globalization. This strategy involves opening local stores in high-traffic areas, such as airports, shopping malls, and central business districts, to attract customers who are already in these locations. These stores serve as gateways to the Starbucks brand, providing customers with a taste of the company's products and encouraging them to visit other Starbucks locations in the future.",
      "The Local Hubs, Global Gateways strategy is an effective way for Starbucks to reach a wider audience while also supporting the local communities where its stores are located. By opening stores in high-traffic areas, Starbucks is able to tap into the foot traffic of these locations, making it easier for customers to discover and visit its stores. This strategy also allows Starbucks to support local economies by providing jobs and contributing to the local tax base.",
      "However, the Local Hubs, Global Gateways strategy also has its challenges. One of the main challenges is the need to balance the Starbucks brand with the local culture and preferences. For example, in some regions, customers may prefer a more traditional coffee experience, which may differ from the Starbucks brand. To overcome this challenge, Starbucks has adapted its menu and offerings to cater to local tastes and preferences while still maintaining the brand's quality standards.",
      "Overall, the Local Hubs, Global Gateways strategy has been successful for Starbucks, allowing the company to expand its global presence while also supporting local communities. By carefully balancing the brand with local culture and preferences, Starbucks has been able to create a win-win situation for both its customers and the communities it serves."

    "question": "5. What is the impact of the closure of the Kranji Turf Club on the redevelopment of the site?",
    "answer": [
      "The closure of the Kranji Turf Club has had a significant impact on the redevelopment of the site. Firstly, the redevelopment plan for the site was delayed due to the closure of the Kranji Turf Club. The club had been operating on the site for over a century, and its closure meant that the site had to undergo extensive remediation work before any redevelopment could take place. This remediation work took longer than expected, and as a result, the redevelopment of the site was delayed.",
      "Secondly, the closure of the Kranji Turf Club also meant that the site had to be rezoned. The site was originally zoned for the operation of a horse racing track, and the closure of the Kranji Turf Club meant that the site had to be rezoned for alternative uses. This rezoning process took time and required extensive consultation with the relevant authorities, resulting in further delays in the redevelopment of the site.",
      "Finally, the closure of the Kranji Turf Club also meant that the site had to undergo a complete transformation. The club had been a well-established and popular institution in the Kranji area for many years, and its closure meant that the site had to be completely transformed into something new. This transformation involved significant investment and planning, and it took time to determine the best use for the site.",
      "In conclusion, the closure of the Kranji Turf Club had a significant impact on the redevelopment of the site. The redevelopment plan was delayed, the site had to be rezoned, and the site had to undergo a complete transformation. These factors all contributed to the delay in the redevelopment of the site."

      "However, given Singapore\u2019s land constraints and urgent land-use needs, it will be increasingly difficult to justify the conservation of buildings and facilities that occupy large plots of land.",
      "At 120ha, the Kranji Turf Club is almost four times the size of Dover Forest (33ha) and more than double the size of Keppel Club (48ha). Both of those sites have been slated for redevelopment into housing estates.",
      "While critics of the Dover Forest redevelopment suggested building flats on existing vacant sites, housing estates are in reality developed as an integrated whole.",
      "This means that housing estates need to include not only homes but also transport infrastructure, schools, markets, food outlets and medical facilities, requiring large plots of land rather than random pockets of space.",
      "The impetus for the Turf Club\u2019s closure is also related to a broader decline of interest in horse racing.",
      "According to a report from The Economist, horse racing viewership and attendance have been decreasing rapidly in the United States, pushed by declining interest in the sport as well as the proliferation of alternative gambling venues like casinos.",
      "In Singapore, horse racing average attendance has fallen from 6,000 per day in 2019 to current levels of 2,600 per day.",
      "Beyond its size, a racecourse is also a highly specialised facility that is designed to provide space for the care, training and racing of horses.",
      "At the Singapore Turf Club, there are multiple tracks for different race types and training purposes, racing and resting stables to accommodate horses, and an equine pool for training purposes. There are also a grandstand and carparks for accommodating spectators on race days.",
      "It will not be easy to convert such facilities for residential and commercial uses, nor will it be an optimal use of space and resources.",
      "It is possible that for the same reasons, other countries have considered closure of their horse racing tracks.",
      "In India, there is an ongoing debate about converting Mumbai\u2019s Mahalaxmi Race Course into a central park.",
      "In the United Kingdom, the Folkestone Racecourse in the county of Kent was closed in 2012 and recently approved for redevelopment into Otterpool Park Garden Town. This is a sustainability-focused town development that will provide housing, business premises and recreational facilities.",
      "In both instances, the demolishment (or proposed demolishment) of a racecourse frees up space for building homes and green spaces.",
      "In cases where large sports venues are conserved in the past, these often involved sports that continue to enjoy strong interest and viewership.",
      "Such venues include Berlin\u2019s Olympiastadion, which was a stadium built for the 1936 summer Olympics that is now used for international football matches.",
      "In Athens, there is the Panathenaic Stadium which was built around 330 BC. It has gone through refurbishments over the course of its history and remains in use as an Olympics venue.",
      "Given space constraints, Singapore will often face difficult trade-offs between urban redevelopment and conservation.",
      "This is further complicated by the fact that both are emotionally charged issues that matter a great deal to many.",
      "While it is important to conserve buildings and spaces that hold special meaning or memories for their users, there is also an urgent need to ensure sufficient housing and commercial spaces.",
      "Both are critical for the population."

      "Karen Tee",
      "A number of years ago, I remember excitedly anticipating a dinner reunion with a few of my teenage-era friends whom I had recently reconnected with. Back in the day, we were really close, sometimes egging each other on to defy our well-meaning teachers and then, when push came to shove, pulling all-nighters together to study for examinations.",
      "But when we finally met up again as adults, the chemistry had evaporated. I no longer found our shared jokes funny, and our updates about our respective life choices in the years since graduating struck me as mundane.",
      "The others likely felt the same way as none of us took the effort to initiate conversation or meet up again. It was to the best of my knowledge, a multi-way ghosting, with each of us abruptly cutting off communication without prior explanation.",
      "Having gone through the classic five stages of grief (denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance) when I was previously ghosted by an ex, I expected to feel at least a tinge of sadness at this unceremonious end to a once-cherished friendship circle. In fact, a recent study found that people often feel just as hurt at being ghosted by a friend as they do with a romantic partner.",
      "But surprisingly, I was unmoved by the entire experience. Instead, I felt a sense of relief that I had freed up time to focus on other things that I found more important without having to go through the whole rigmarole of explaining myself to someone else. They included work commitments and also nurturing new friendships with other people whom I felt a deeper connection with at that stage in life.",
      "Certainly, there is catharsis in wallowing in grief when losing a friend. Like with any other broken relationship, psychologists recommend taking time to express your emotions such as by journalling or indulging in a good cry, if you feel so inclined.",
      "Yet it is a reality that many friendships tend to fall by the wayside in our 30s and 40s. As Julie Beck, senior editor of the family section at The Atlantic observes, unlike the close-knit core friendships that those in their teens and 20s tend to forge and rely on, priorities change quite drastically later in life.",
      "Life happens. Marriage, childbirth and caring for elderly parents take centre stage, so it makes sense that platonic friendships, which are voluntary by nature, become less important.",
      "Certainly, we all probably have a personal story to share about friends who fell off the radar or stopped sending WhatsApp messages after they had kids. In this time-pressed world, who can blame them for not staying in contact, with other matters vying for their attention?",
      "This is why my preferred coping mechanism, which is also recommended by experts, is to reframe one\u2019s perspective. Instead of regarding a ghosted friendship as a deliberate rejection \u2013 which would be the case if a romantic partner did ghost you \u2013 simply tell yourself that life got in the way. This way, there is no reason to behave like a jilted lover. Rather, I prefer to move on quickly with no drama and focus my headspace on other priorities instead.",
      "Still, it is true that friendships are integral to one\u2019s happiness. In the book Friends: Understanding The Power Of Our Most Important Relationships, psychologist and author Robin Dunbar writes that the quality of our friendships has a huge influence on our happiness, health and even mortality.",
      "Dunbar, who famously came up with the hypothesis that each individual typically has the bandwidth for 150 friends, also posits that it is one\u2019s inner circle of about 15 closer friends who will be there to offer emotional, physical and financial help in times of need.",
      "So, if anything, it is even more essential to cultivate and perhaps curate these friendships so that they align with one\u2019s priorities and needs at any given stage in life. Even now in my 30s, I see no reason why I should stop making new friends and often take the effort to attend social or networking events to connect with like-minded people.",
      "Unsentimental as it may sound, I am also clear-eyed when friends drift apart. Likewise, I do not begrudge formerly close friends when they decide they would rather devote precious spare time to nurturing other friendship groups that they feel closer to.",
      "In these cases, ghosting actually turns out to be a useful method for letting friendships melt away gently into the good night. Its very ambiguity, when one \u2013 or both \u2013 parties simply stop communicating without a farewell note, actually leaves the door open for a reconciliation in the future.",
      "Hence, when a recent WhatsApp group I am a part of erupted in a flurry of ongoing messages about children and pre-school options, I resisted the urge to abruptly leave the chat even though I have very little interest in baby talk. There was no reason to make others uncomfortable with an unannounced exit when they were exchanging notes on things that mattered to them.",
      "Instead, I did some ghosting of my own by archiving the chat so that my phone will not be inundated with message alerts. It is likely I will stay out of this chat group for as long as the discussions are all about child-related travails.",
      "But some day in the future, should the chatter drift towards a topic that catches my interest, I will take it as my cue to pick up where I last left off with a nonchalant, \u201cHello! Remember me?\u201d",

      "A number of years ago, I remember excitedly anticipating a dinner reunion with a few of my teenage-era friends whom I had recently reconnected with. Back in the day, we were really close, sometimes egging each other on to defy our well-meaning teachers and then, when push came to shove, pulling all-nighters together to study for examinations.",
      "But when we finally met up again as adults, the chemistry had evaporated. I no longer found our shared jokes funny, and our updates about our respective life choices in the years since graduating struck me as mundane.",
      "The others likely felt the same way as none of us took the effort to initiate conversation or meet up again. It was to the best of my knowledge, a multi-way ghosting, with each of us abruptly cutting off communication without prior explanation.",
      "Having gone through the classic five stages of grief (denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance) when I was previously ghosted by an ex, I expected to feel at least a tinge of sadness at this unceremonious end to a once-cherished friendship circle. In fact, a recent study found that people often feel just as hurt at being ghosted by a friend as they do with a romantic partner.",
      "But surprisingly, I was unmoved by the entire experience. Instead, I felt a sense of relief that I had freed up time to focus on other things that I found more important without having to go through the whole rigmarole of explaining myself to someone else. They included work commitments and also nurturing new friendships with other people whom I felt a deeper connection with at that stage in life.",
      "Certainly, there is catharsis in wallowing in grief when losing a friend. Like with any other broken relationship, psychologists recommend taking time to express your emotions such as by journalling or indulging in a good cry, if you feel so inclined.",
      "Yet it is a reality that many friendships tend to fall by the wayside in our 30s and 40s. As Julie Beck, senior editor of the family section at The Atlantic observes, unlike the close-knit core friendships that those in their teens and 20s tend to forge and rely on, priorities change quite drastically later in life.",
      "Life happens. Marriage, childbirth and caring for elderly parents take centre stage, so it makes sense that platonic friendships, which are voluntary by nature, become less important.",
      "Certainly, we all probably have a personal story to share about friends who fell off the radar or stopped sending WhatsApp messages after they had kids. In this time-pressed world, who can blame them for not staying in contact, with other matters vying for their attention?",
      "This is why my preferred coping mechanism, which is also recommended by experts, is to reframe one\u2019s perspective. Instead of regarding a ghosted friendship as a deliberate rejection \u2013 which would be the case if a romantic partner did ghost you \u2013 simply tell yourself that life got in the way. This way, there is no reason to behave like a jilted lover. Rather, I prefer to move on quickly with no drama and focus my headspace on other priorities instead.",
      "Still, it is true that friendships are integral to one\u2019s happiness. In the book Friends: Understanding The Power Of Our Most Important Relationships, psychologist and author Robin Dunbar writes that the quality of our friendships has a huge influence on our happiness, health and even mortality.",
      "Dunbar, who famously came up with the hypothesis that each individual typically has the bandwidth for 150 friends, also posits that it is one\u2019s inner circle of about 15 closer friends who will be there to offer emotional, physical and financial help in times of need.",
      "So, if anything, it is even more essential to cultivate and perhaps curate these friendships so that they align with one\u2019s priorities and needs at any given stage in life. Even now in my 30s, I see no reason why I should stop making new friends and often take the effort to attend social or networking events to connect with like-minded people.",
      "Unsentimental as it may sound, I am also clear-eyed when friends drift apart. Likewise, I do not begrudge formerly close friends when they decide they would rather devote precious spare time to nurturing other friendship groups that they feel closer to.",
      "In these cases, ghosting actually turns out to be a useful method for letting friendships melt away gently into the good night. Its very ambiguity, when one \u2013 or both \u2013 parties simply stop communicating without a farewell note, actually leaves the door open for a reconciliation in the future.",
      "Hence, when a recent WhatsApp group I am a part of erupted in a flurry of ongoing messages about children and pre-school options, I resisted the urge to abruptly leave the chat even though I have very little interest in baby talk. There was no reason to make others uncomfortable with an unannounced exit when they were exchanging notes on things that mattered to them.",
      "Instead, I did some ghosting of my own by archiving the chat so that my phone will not be inundated with message alerts. It is likely I will stay out of this chat group for as long as the discussions are all about child-related travails.",
      "But some day in the future, should the chatter drift towards a topic that catches my interest, I will take it as my cue to pick up where I last left off with a nonchalant, \u201cHello! Remember me?\u201d",
      "After all, I never really did \u201cbreak up\u201d with them, I just drifted away for a while."

      "Friendships are an essential aspect of a fulfilling life. They provide emotional support, a sense of belonging, and a source of fun and enjoyment. Maintaining friendships can improve mental and physical health, enhance personal growth, and promote a sense of well-being.",
      "Firstly, friendships can provide emotional support during difficult times. Friends can offer a listening ear, provide advice, and help to alleviate stress and anxiety. Research has shown that people who have strong social support networks are more resilient and better able to cope with stress and trauma.",
      "Secondly, friendships can provide a sense of belonging and community. Being part of a group of friends can give individuals a sense of identity and purpose. It can also provide opportunities to participate in social activities and events, which can enhance personal growth and development.",
      "Finally, friendships can provide a source of fun and enjoyment. Spending time with friends can be a great way to relieve stress and have a good time. It can also provide opportunities to try new things and experience new adventures.",
      "In conclusion, maintaining friendships is crucial for a fulfilling life. They provide emotional support, a sense of belonging, and a source of fun and enjoyment. Maintaining friendships can improve mental and physical health, enhance personal growth, and promote a sense of well-being."

      "Karen Tee",
      "A number of years ago, I remember excitedly anticipating a dinner reunion with a few of my teenage-era friends whom I had recently reconnected with. Back in the day, we were really close, sometimes egging each other on to defy our well-meaning teachers and then, when push came to shove, pulling all-nighters together to study for examinations.",
      "But when we finally met up again as adults, the chemistry had evaporated. I no longer found our shared jokes funny, and our updates about our respective life choices in the years since graduating struck me as mundane.",
      "The others likely felt the same way as none of us took the effort to initiate conversation or meet up again. It was to the best of my knowledge, a multi-way ghosting, with each of us abruptly cutting off communication without prior explanation.",
      "Having gone through the classic five stages of grief (denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance) when I was previously ghosted by an ex, I expected to feel at least a tinge of sadness at this unceremonious end to a once-cherished friendship circle. In fact, a recent study found that people often feel just as hurt at being ghosted by a friend as they do with a romantic partner.",
      "But surprisingly, I was unmoved by the entire experience. Instead, I felt a sense of relief that I had freed up time to focus on other things that I found more important without having to go through the whole rigmarole of explaining myself to someone else. They included work commitments and also nurturing new friendships with other people whom I felt a deeper connection with at that stage in life.",
      "Certainly, there is catharsis in wallowing in grief when losing a friend. Like with any other broken relationship, psychologists recommend taking time to express your emotions such as by journalling or indulging in a good cry, if you feel so inclined.",
      "Yet it is a reality that many friendships tend to fall by the wayside in our 30s and 40s. As Julie Beck, senior editor of the family section at The Atlantic observes, unlike the close-knit core friendships that those in their teens and 20s tend to forge and rely on, priorities change quite drastically later in life.",
      "Life happens. Marriage, childbirth and caring for elderly parents take centre stage, so it makes sense that platonic friendships, which are voluntary by nature, become less important.",
      "Certainly, we all probably have a personal story to share about friends who fell off the radar or stopped sending WhatsApp messages after they had kids. In this time-pressed world, who can blame them for not staying in contact, with other matters vying for their attention?",
      "This is why my preferred coping mechanism, which is also recommended by experts, is to reframe one\u2019s perspective. Instead of regarding a ghosted friendship as a deliberate rejection \u2013 which would be the case if a romantic partner did ghost you \u2013 simply tell yourself that life got in the way. This way, there is no reason to behave like a jilted lover. Rather, I prefer to move on quickly with no drama and focus my headspace on other priorities instead.",
      "Still, it is true that friendships are integral to one\u2019s happiness. In the book Friends: Understanding The Power Of Our Most Important Relationships, psychologist and author Robin Dunbar writes that the quality of our friendships has a huge influence on our happiness, health and even mortality.",
      "Dunbar, who famously came up with the hypothesis that each individual typically has the bandwidth for 150 friends, also posits that it is one\u2019s inner circle of about 15 closer friends who will be there to offer emotional, physical and financial help in times of need.",
      "So, if anything, it is even more essential to cultivate and perhaps curate these friendships so that they align with one\u2019s priorities and needs at any given stage in life. Even now in my 30s, I see no reason why I should stop making new friends and often take the effort to attend social or networking events to connect with like-minded people.",
      "Unsentimental as it may sound, I am also clear-eyed when friends drift apart. Likewise, I do not begrudge formerly close friends when they decide they would rather devote precious spare time to nurturing other friendship groups that they feel closer to.",
      "In these cases, ghosting actually turns out to be a useful method for letting friendships melt away gently into the good night. Its very ambiguity, when one \u2013 or both \u2013 parties simply stop communicating without a farewell note, actually leaves the door open for a reconciliation in the future.",
      "Hence, when a recent WhatsApp group I am a part of erupted in a flurry of ongoing messages about children and pre-school options, I resisted the urge to abruptly leave the chat even though I have very little interest in baby talk. There was no reason to make others uncomfortable with an unannounced exit when they were exchanging notes on things that mattered to them.",
      "Instead, I did some ghosting of my own by archiving the chat so that my phone will not be inundated with message alerts. It is likely I will stay out of this chat group for as long as the discussions are all about child-related travails.",
      "But some day in the future, should the chatter drift towards a topic that catches my interest, I will take it as my cue to pick up where I last left off with a nonchalant, \u201cHello! Remember me?\u201d",
      "After all, I never really did \u201cbreak up\u201d with them, I just drifted away for a while."
    ],
    "question": "5. How do you handle it when a friend stops communicating without explanation?",
    "answer": [
      "When a friend stops communicating without explanation, it can be a difficult and frustrating situation to handle. Here are three key claims to consider:",
      "1. Give them space: The first step in handling this situation is to give your friend the space they need. This means not reaching out to them repeatedly and not trying to pry into their reasons for not communicating. It's important to respect their decision and let them take the time they need to process whatever is going on in their life.",
      "2. Reach out after some time: After some time has passed, it may be appropriate to reach out to your friend to check in and see how they are doing. This can be a gentle reminder that you are there for them and that you care about their well-being. However, it's important to be patient and not push too hard, as they may still need more time to process their emotions.",
      "3. Offer support: If your friend does eventually reach out to you, it's important to be there for them and offer your support. This can include listening to their concerns and offering advice or help if needed. It's important to remember that your friend may be going through a difficult time, and it's your role as a friend to be there for them and offer a shoulder to lean on.",
      "In conclusion, handling a situation where a friend stops communicating without explanation requires patience, understanding, and support. By giving your friend space, reaching out after some time, and offering your support, you can help them through a difficult time and strengthen your friendship in the process."

      "Gillian Tett",
      "Three weeks ago, the United States Treasury announced the launch of a new oversight committee called the Cloud Executive Steering Group.",
      "It received almost no public attention. No wonder: Compared with the explosive controversies around cryptocurrencies, ChatGPT or Europe\u2019s new drive to break up Google\u2019s dominance of adtech, cloud computing \u2013 the public and private data storage and processing platforms run by Big Tech vendors \u2013 sounds achingly dull. So much so, that most Americans view Amazon as \u201cjust\u201d an online retail giant, even though its cloud division now generates significant revenues.",
      "But investors and financial services consumers alike should wake up. For, as a report from the Treasury\u2019s little-known Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee (FBIIC) declared earlier in 2023, regulators are getting nervous about the systemic financial risks emanating from the cloud. Indeed, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) suggested in 2022 \u2013 echoing work by European central banks \u2013 that \u201cbig tech interdependencies\u201d have become \u201ca key policy blind spot\u201d.",
      "Thus, the crucial question for the Treasury\u2019s cloud committee \u2013 which includes both regulators and bankers such as PNC Financial Services chief executive Bill Demchak \u2013 is whether this \u201cblind spot\u201d can be corrected before a not-so-boring accident erupts.",
      "There are at least three big issues to consider. The first is the speed of change in computing practices. The FBIIC report notes that more than 90 per cent of the members of the American Bankers Association are shifting activity on to the cloud, although more than 80 per cent say this is at an early stage. Since a separate survey suggests that two-thirds of banks expect at least 30 per cent of their activities to be cloud-based in the next three years, the FBIIC calculates that cloud usage will triple by then. The pattern in Europe seems similar.",
      "Second, financial regulators are ill-equipped to handle this explosive growth. They have always struggled to track information technology, since they have historically hired economists, not techies. But when finance companies were running their own IT operations, regulators did at least have a mandate to watch them.",
      "However, the dash into the cloud places more of that activity in the hands of Big Tech vendors, who have never faced serious central bank scrutiny before. Some observers, such as BIS head Agustin Carstens, think that an overhaul is overdue, in order to extend the \u201cregulatory perimeter\u201d. Maybe so.",
      "But America\u2019s tech giants will fiercely resist efforts to put them under the purview of central banks or other financial regulators \u2013 and the White House currently shows little stomach for that battle. That leaves the cloud in a financial regulatory grey zone. \u201cDue to the different legal authorities for each agency, no single agency can see across the many use cases and the network of dependencies on cloud services within the financial sector,\u201d the FBIIC report observed. In plain English: This is a fog.",
      "Third, insofar as data is available, it seems that there are big, and growing, concentration risks. This might sound surprising. After all, one reason for financial groups to dash into the cloud is to reduce their reliance on costly, and potentially vulnerable, in-house data centres. A distributed model is supposed to be more resilient.",
      "But one bitter irony of finance is that innovations which purport to reduce risk by distributing it can sometimes also concentrate it in new, surprising and half-hidden ways. Consider credit. Before 2008, it was assumed that innovations such as securitised mortgage products would promote resilience by spreading default risk beyond banks.",
      "But when the 2008 crisis hit, it emerged that numerous players had quietly hedged their activities with the same entity \u2013 AIG Financial Products (AIGFP). That created a hidden \u201csingle point of failure\u201d, or Spof, to use an engineering term, and generated shocks when AIGFP wobbled.",
      "Cloud computing echoes this so-called Spof issue, as Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu told the BIS earlier in 2023. Most notably \u2013 and as Brussels often complains \u2013 the cloud is dominated by an oligopoly of Amazon, Microsoft and Google. If one of those players suffered a big cyber attack, weather-linked disruption or simply went bankrupt, that would rock the system.",
      "Big Tech executives insist this will not occur. You would hope so. And these huge companies are almost certainly better at handling cyber risks than banks\u2019 in-house teams. But the 2020 SolarWinds hack on Microsoft\u2019s cloud systems showed that nobody is infallible. So did the recent Ion saga and Capita data breach.",
      "And even without cyber risks, the commercial power wielded by this oligopoly is unnerving, particularly for Europeans. Indeed, Britain\u2019s Office of Communications, or Ofcom, has launched an investigation.",
      "So all eyes are now on the Treasury\u2019s Cloud Committee.

    "answer": [
      "The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has recently released a report suggesting that \"big tech interdependencies\" pose a significant risk to global financial stability. The report highlights that the increasing reliance on technology by financial institutions, such as big tech firms, has created a complex web of interdependencies that can lead to systemic risks.",
      "One of the key claims is that big tech firms have become an integral part of the global financial system, and their failure could have far-reaching consequences. The report notes that the interconnections between these firms and traditional financial institutions have increased, making the system more vulnerable to disruptions.",
      "Another claim is that regulators need to take a more proactive approach to address the risks posed by big tech interdependencies. The BIS suggests that regulators should focus on improving transparency, strengthening governance, and ensuring that these firms are adequately capitalized.",
      "Finally, the report emphasizes that the global financial system needs to be more resilient to disruptions, and big tech interdependencies should be part of this resilience. The BIS suggests that policymakers should consider implementing macroprudential policies to address systemic risks, such as stress testing and capital requirements.",
      "In conclusion, the BIS report highlights the potential risks posed by big tech interdependencies and calls for regulators to take a more proactive approach to address these risks. It also suggests that the global financial system needs to be more resilient to disruptions, and that big tech interdependencies should be part of this resilience."

    "question": "3. How is the speed of change in computing practices affecting the financial industry?",
    "answer": [
      "The speed of change in computing practices is having a profound impact on the financial industry. On one hand, it has enabled financial institutions to process transactions faster and more efficiently, leading to increased productivity and profitability. On the other hand, it has also created new risks and challenges, such as cyber threats and the need for constant innovation to stay competitive.",
      "One major way in which the speed of change in computing practices is affecting the financial industry is through the rise of digital banking. Digital banking allows customers to perform a wide range of financial transactions online, including checking accounts, loans, and investments. This has made banking more convenient and accessible for customers, but it has also created new security risks that financial institutions must address.",
      "Another way in which the speed of change in computing practices is affecting the financial industry is through the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms. These algorithms can analyze vast amounts of financial data and make predictions about future trends, allowing financial institutions to make more informed decisions. However, they can also create new ethical concerns, such as the potential for bias in decision-making and the need for transparency in algorithmic decision-making.",
      "Finally, the speed of change in computing practices is also affecting the financial industry through the growing importance of blockchain technology. Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that allows for secure and transparent transactions without the need for intermediaries. This has the potential to disrupt traditional financial systems and create new opportunities for innovation and growth. However, it also raises questions about the regulatory framework for blockchain-based financial systems and the potential for new forms of financial fraud."

      "It received almost no public attention. No wonder: Compared with the explosive controversies around cryptocurrencies, ChatGPT or Europe\u2019s new drive to break up Google\u2019s dominance of adtech, cloud computing \u2013 the public and private data storage and processing platforms run by Big Tech vendors \u2013 sounds achingly dull. So much so, that most Americans view Amazon as \u201cjust\u201d an online retail giant, even though its cloud division now generates significant revenues.",
      "But investors and financial services consumers alike should wake up. For, as a report from the Treasury\u2019s little-known Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee (FBIIC) declared earlier in 2023, regulators are getting nervous about the systemic financial risks emanating from the cloud. Indeed, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) suggested in 2022 \u2013 echoing work by European central banks \u2013 that \u201cbig tech interdependencies\u201d have become \u201ca key policy blind spot\u201d.",
      "Thus, the crucial question for the Treasury\u2019s cloud committee \u2013 which includes both regulators and bankers such as PNC Financial Services chief executive Bill Demchak \u2013 is whether this \u201cblind spot\u201d can be corrected before a not-so-boring accident erupts.",
      "There are at least three big issues to consider. The first is the speed of change in computing practices. The FBIIC report notes that more than 90 per cent of the members of the American Bankers Association are shifting activity on to the cloud, although more than 80 per cent say this is at an early stage. Since a separate survey suggests that two-thirds of banks expect at least 30 per cent of their activities to be cloud-based in the next three years, the FBIIC calculates that cloud usage will triple by then. The pattern in Europe seems similar.",
      "Second, financial regulators are ill-equipped to handle this explosive growth. They have always struggled to track information technology, since they have historically hired economists, not techies. But when finance companies were running their own IT operations, regulators did at least have a mandate to watch them.",
      "However, the dash into the cloud places more of that activity in the hands of Big Tech vendors, who have never faced serious central bank scrutiny before. Some observers, such as BIS head Agustin Carstens, think that an overhaul is overdue, in order to extend the \u201cregulatory perimeter\u201d. Maybe so.",
      "But America\u2019s tech giants will fiercely resist efforts to put them under the purview of central banks or other financial regulators \u2013 and the White House currently shows little stomach for that battle. That leaves the cloud in a financial regulatory grey zone. \u201cDue to the different legal authorities for each agency, no single agency can see across the many use cases and the network of dependencies on cloud services within the financial sector,\u201d the FBIIC report observed. In plain English: This is a fog.",
      "Third, insofar as data is available, it seems that there are big, and growing, concentration risks. This might sound surprising. After all, one reason for financial groups to dash into the cloud is to reduce their reliance on costly, and potentially vulnerable, in-house data centres. A distributed model is supposed to be more resilient.",
      "But one bitter irony of finance is that innovations which purport to reduce risk by distributing it can sometimes also concentrate it in new, surprising and half-hidden ways. Consider credit. Before 2008, it was assumed that innovations such as securitised mortgage products would promote resilience by spreading default risk beyond banks.",
      "But when the 2008 crisis hit, it emerged that numerous players had quietly hedged their activities with the same entity \u2013 AIG Financial Products (AIGFP). That created a hidden \u201csingle point of failure\u201d, or Spof, to use an engineering term, and generated shocks when AIGFP wobbled.",

The two most recent presidents, Dr Kim Jim Yong and Mr David Malpass, resigned before completing their full terms. Dr Kim, a physician who was appointed in 2012, presided over a chaotic reorganisation of the bank and lost the confidence of its staff, while Mr Malpass, a former Treasury department official from the Trump administration, was severely criticised by scientists, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and members of the US Congress for failing to address the climate crisis, and indeed, for being a climate denier.",

One of their arguments is that since promoting development is the core mission of the bank, its leader should be drawn from among candidates from developing countries who have experience and expertise in tackling development-related challenges.",

      "The controversy in the leadership of the World Bank over the past decade can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the World Bank has been criticized for promoting neoliberal economic policies that prioritize market-oriented solutions over social welfare and development. This approach has been blamed for exacerbating poverty and inequality in many countries.",
      "Secondly, the World Bank has faced allegations of corruption and lack of transparency in its operations. This has raised concerns about the bank's ability to effectively manage its funds and deliver development projects.",

Some argue that the US should continue to play a leading role in the governance and leadership of the World Bank, as it has historically been a key player in shaping the institution' Eur Leader (2017).

The US has held a permanent seat on the bank's board of executive directors since the bank's inception in 1944, and it has used its position to promote its own interests and values Eur Leader (2017). For example, the US has pushed for policies that prioritize private sector investment and economic growth over social and environmental concerns. However, this approach has been criticized for prioritizing the interests of the US and other developed countries over those of developing countries.",
      "Another argument is that the US's influence has led to a lack of representation for developing countries and has undermined the bank's mission to alleviate poverty and promote sustainable development. Developing countries have long complained that the World Bank has not adequately represented their interests and has prioritized the interests of the US and other developed countries Eur Leader (2017). This has led to calls for reform of the bank's governance structure, including the creation of a more representative and democratic voting system.",

      "Say you order an electric toothbrush for Father\u2019s Day and two shirts for yourself from Amazon. You unpack your order and discover that the electric toothbrush will not charge, and only one shirt fits you. So, you decide to return the unwanted shirt and the electric toothbrush.",
      "Returns like this might seem simple, and often they are free for the consumer. But managing those returns can get costly for retailers, so much so that many returned items are simply thrown out.",
      "In 2022, returns cost retailers about US$816 billion (S$1.1 trillion) in lost sales. That is nearly as much as what the United States spent on public schools and almost twice the cost of returns in 2020. The return process, with transportation and packaging, also generated about 24 million tonnes of planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions in 2022.",
      "Together, costs and emissions create a sustainability problem for retailers and the planet.",
      "As a supply chain management researcher, I follow developments in retail logistics. Let\u2019s take a closer look inside the black box of product returns.",
      "So, you repackaged your unwanted shirt and the electric toothbrush and drove them to UPS, which has an agreement with Amazon for free returns. Now what?",
      "UPS transports those items to the retailer\u2019s warehouses dedicated to processing returns. This step of the process costs the retailer money \u2013 66 per cent of the cost of a US$50 item by one estimate \u2013 and emits carbon dioxide as trucks and planes carry items hundreds of kilometres. The plastic, paper or cardboard from the return package becomes waste.",
      "Processing a return takes two to three times longer than initially shipping the item \u2013 it has to be unpacked, inspected, repacked and rerouted. That adds more to the cost to the company, especially in a tight labour market. Workers have to manually unpack the items, inspect them and, based on the return reason, decide what will happen next.",
      "If a warehouse worker decides the shirt in our example can be resold, the shirt will be repackaged and sent to another warehouse.",
      "Once another consumer orders the shirt, it will be ready to be packed and shipped.",
      "In-store returns can significantly cut warehouse and transportation costs, but driving to a bricks-and-mortar store might not be convenient for the consumer. Only about a quarter of online purchases are returned in person to the store.",
      "If the item is defective, like the electric toothbrush in our example, the warehouse worker might send it back to the manufacturer for fixing and refurbishing. It would be repackaged and loaded on a truck and possibly a plane to be sent to the manufacturer, leading to more carbon dioxide emissions.",
      "If the electric toothbrush can be repaired, the refurbished product is ready to be sold into the consumer market again \u2013 often at a lower price.",
      "Refurbishing returned products helps to achieve a closed-loop supply chain where products are reused rather than disposed of as waste, making the process more sustainable than buying a new item.",
      "Sometimes, however, repairs cost more than the product can be resold for. When it is more expensive to restock or refurbish a product, it may be cheaper for the retailer to throw the item away.",
      "If the company cannot resell the shirt or refurbish the electric toothbrush economically, the outlook for these items is grim. Some are sold in bulk to discount stores. Often, returned products simply end up in landfills, sometimes overseas.",
      "In 2019, about 2.3 million tonnes of waste from returns were sent to landfills, according to an estimate by return technology platform Optoro. By 2022, the estimated waste had more than doubled to about 4.74 million tonnes.",
      "In the past, customers who wanted to return items by mail were often expected to do so on their own dime. That changed after Amazon began offering free returns and providing easy-to-use drop-off locations at UPS or Kohl\u2019s stores. Other retailers followed suit to compete, with many seeing free returns as a way to keep shoppers coming back.",
      "But that pendulum may be starting to swing back. The percentage of retailers charging to ship returns increased from 33 per cent to 41 per cent in 2022.",
      "Retailers are trying several other techniques to lower the return rate, waste and losses, which ultimately come back to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "Some retailers have shortened the return window, limited frequent returns, or stopped offering free returns.",
      "Other strategies include virtual dressing rooms and clearer fitting guides, which can help reduce clothing returns, as can high-quality photos and videos that reflect size and colour accurately.",

The plastic, paper or cardboard from the return package becomes waste.",
      "Processing a return takes two to three times longer than initially shipping the item \u2013 it has to be unpacked, inspected, repacked and rerouted. That adds more to the cost to the company, especially in a tight labour market. Workers have to manually unpack the items, inspect them and, based on the return reason, decide what will happen next.",
      "If a warehouse worker decides the shirt in our example can be resold, the shirt will be repackaged and sent to another warehouse.",
      "Once another consumer orders the shirt, it will be ready to be packed and shipped.",
      "In-store returns can significantly cut warehouse and transportation costs, but driving to a bricks-and-mortar store might not be convenient for the consumer. Only about a quarter of online purchases are returned in person to the store.",
      "If the item is defective, like the electric toothbrush in our example, the warehouse worker might send it back to the manufacturer for fixing and refurbishing. It would be repackaged and loaded on a truck and possibly a plane to be sent to the manufacturer, leading to more carbon dioxide emissions.",
      "If the electric toothbrush can be repaired, the refurbished product is ready to be sold into the consumer market again \u2013 often at a lower price.",
      "Refurbishing returned products helps to achieve a closed-loop supply chain where products are reused rather than disposed of as waste, making the process more sustainable than buying a new item.",
      "Sometimes, however, repairs cost more than the product can be resold for. When it is more expensive to restock or refurbish a product, it may be cheaper for the retailer to throw the item away.",
      "If the company cannot resell the shirt or refurbish the electric toothbrush economically, the outlook for these items is grim. Some are sold in bulk to discount stores. Often, returned products simply end up in landfills, sometimes overseas.",
      "In 2019, about 2.3 million tonnes of waste from returns were sent to landfills, according to an estimate by return technology platform Optoro. By 2022, the estimated waste had more than doubled to about 4.74 million tonnes.",
      "In the past, customers who wanted to return items by mail were often expected to do so on their own dime. That changed after Amazon began offering free returns and providing easy-to-use drop-off locations at UPS or Kohl\u2019s stores. Other retailers followed suit to compete, with many seeing free returns as a way to keep shoppers coming back.",
      "But that pendulum may be starting to swing back. The percentage of retailers charging to ship returns increased from 33 per cent to 41 per cent in 2022.",
      "Retailers are trying several other techniques to lower the return rate, waste and losses, which ultimately come back to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "Some retailers have shortened the return window, limited frequent returns, or stopped offering free returns.",
      "Other strategies include virtual dressing rooms and clearer fitting guides, which can help reduce clothing returns, as can high-quality photos and videos that reflect size and colour accurately.",
      "If consumers use those tools and pay attention to sizing, they can help cut down on retail\u2019s growing climate footprint."
    ],
    "question": "5. What are some strategies retailers are using to reduce return rates, waste, and losses?",
    "answer": [
      "1. Retailers are implementing advanced inventory management systems to accurately forecast demand and reduce stockouts and overstocking. This helps to minimize waste by ensuring that the right products are available in the right quantities, while also reducing return rates by providing customers with the products they are looking for.",
      "2. Retailers are offering more flexible return policies, such as longer return periods and easier return processes, to reduce the number of returns and make it more convenient for customers to return products if necessary. This helps to minimize waste by reducing the number of returned products that need to be liquidated, while also reducing losses by making it easier for customers to return products and receive a refund.",
      "3. Retailers are investing in technology and automation to streamline the returns process and reduce manual handling, which can reduce the risk of damage to products and minimize waste. This can include automated sorting systems, robotic picking and packing, and automated shipping and logistics. By reducing waste and losses, retailers can improve their bottom line and enhance their reputation with customers."

      "It is extremely troubling that a recent study, conducted by Duke-NUS Medical School and the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), has suggested that anxiety and depression symptoms among people here could be costing Singapore nearly $16 billion a year, or about 2.9 per cent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product. This is so as a result of absenteeism, reduced productivity, and the use of healthcare resources. According to the researchers, this is the first study after the coronavirus pandemic that estimates the prevalence of, and quantifies the financial cost of, depression and anxiety symptoms among Singaporean adults. While the economic and social dislocation produced by Covid-19 expectedly produced a decline in mental health, what is worrying is that even the national recovery from that period of stress did not produce better results in the survey, which covered 5,725 Singaporeans above 21 years old between April and June 2022. Clearly, mental health is an issue that Singapore must grapple with urgently.",
      "The lesson to be drawn from the survey is the need to treat mental health on a par with physical health. Singapore possesses admirable assets by way of its hospitals, both public and private, its step-down care facilities, its polyclinics, its general practitioners, and its specialists. They cater to the physical well-being of residents in a way that justifies Singapore\u2019s reputation for First World healthcare. Mental health, too, is addressed by the IMH, private institutions and civil society organisations. However, the stigma attached traditionally to mental problems \u2013 in a way that does not affect those seeking medical care for physical ailments \u2013 deters many sufferers from seeking early and preventive care. As a result, they suffer in silence when there are avenues open for their treatment and rehabilitation. Some prefer to go into denial mode. Such attitudes should not exist in a mature society. People must understand that it is not morally reprehensible to be mentally unwell, any more than it is to be physically sick.",
      "It is reassuring that companies are stepping up efforts to help staff with mental health issues. Stress and burnout, to say nothing about anxiety and depression, are workplace ills that erode the human talent on which corporate success is based ultimately. Companies which treat staff under mental pressure with understanding and empathy are likely to have employees who are motivated because they feel valued. Sufferers, too, would come forward for help early because they would not fear being stigmatised by colleagues. More companies here are including mental wellness benefits in their corporate insurance coverage in a healthy sign of the times.",

    "answer": [
      "The Covid-19 pandemic had a significant impact on mental health in Singapore. According to a survey conducted by the Singapore Mental Health Alliance, the pandemic had caused a 22% increase in anxiety and depression symptoms among Singaporeans, with many reporting feelings of isolation, helplessness, and fear. In addition, the prolonged lockdown and social distancing measures imposed by the government caused significant stress and strain on individuals and families.",
      "One of the most worrying aspects of the national recovery from this period of stress is the potential for a resurgence of mental health issues. Many individuals who were already struggling with mental health issues before the pandemic were further exacerbated by the stress and trauma of the pandemic. Additionally, the prolonged recovery period and the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic's eventual end have left many individuals feeling anxious and uncertain about the future.",
      "Another concern is the potential for the government's response to the pandemic to have a lasting impact on mental health. While the government's measures were well-intentioned, some were criticized for being overly restrictive and causing further stress and anxiety. Furthermore, the government's emphasis on national recovery and economic recovery may have overshadowed the importance of mental health recovery, which could lead to a lack of support for individuals who are struggling with mental health issues.",
      "Overall, the Covid-19 pandemic had a significant impact on mental health in Singapore, and the national recovery from this period of stress is a cause for concern. It is important for the government and society as a whole to prioritize mental health and provide support for individuals who are struggling with mental health issues."

      "It is extremely troubling that a recent study, conducted by Duke-NUS Medical School and the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), has suggested that anxiety and depression symptoms among people here could be costing Singapore nearly $16 billion a year, or about 2.9 per cent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product. This is so as a result of absenteeism, reduced productivity, and the use of healthcare resources. According to the researchers, this is the first study after the coronavirus pandemic that estimates the prevalence of, and quantifies the financial cost of, depression and anxiety symptoms among Singaporean adults. While the economic and social dislocation produced by Covid-19 expectedly produced a decline in mental health, what is worrying is that even the national recovery from that period of stress did not produce better results in the survey, which covered 5,725 Singaporeans above 21 years old between April and June 2022. Clearly, mental health is an issue that Singapore must grapple with urgently.",
      "The lesson to be drawn from the survey is the need to treat mental health on a par with physical health. Singapore possesses admirable assets by way of its hospitals, both public and private, its step-down care facilities, its polyclinics, its general practitioners, and its specialists. They cater to the physical well-being of residents in a way that justifies Singapore\u2019s reputation for First World healthcare. Mental health, too, is addressed by the IMH, private institutions and civil society organisations. However, the stigma attached traditionally to mental problems \u2013 in a way that does not affect those seeking medical care for physical ailments \u2013 deters many sufferers from seeking early and preventive care. As a result, they suffer in silence when there are avenues open for their treatment and rehabilitation. Some prefer to go into denial mode. Such attitudes should not exist in a mature society.

    "question": "3. What is the lesson to be drawn from the survey regarding mental health in Singapore, and why is it important to treat mental health on a par with physical health?",
    "answer": [
      "The lesson to be drawn from the survey regarding mental health in Singapore is that mental health is just as important as physical health. Many people still view mental health as a taboo topic, but it is crucial to recognize that mental health issues can have a significant impact on a person's daily life, relationships, and overall well-being. It is important to treat mental health on a par with physical health because mental health problems can lead to physical health issues, and vice versa. For example, people with depression are more likely to develop chronic physical health problems such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. Similarly, people with chronic physical health problems are at a higher risk of developing mental health issues such as anxiety and depression.",
      "Furthermore, mental health issues can have a significant impact on a person's ability to function in daily life. People with mental health problems may experience difficulty with daily activities such as work, school, and socializing. They may also experience symptoms such as insomnia, fatigue, and loss of appetite, which can further impact their physical health.",
      "In conclusion, the survey on mental health in Singapore highlights the importance of treating mental health on a par with physical health. It is crucial to recognize that mental health issues can have a significant impact on a person's daily life, relationships, and overall well-being. It is important to address mental health issues early on and to provide people with the resources they need to manage their mental health. This will not only improve their mental health but also their physical health, overall well-being, and ability to function in daily life."

    ],
    "question": "4. What are some of the assets that Singapore possesses in terms of healthcare facilities and services, and how can these be leveraged to address mental health issues?",
    "answer": [
      "Singapore possesses a range of advanced healthcare facilities and services, including world-class hospitals, specialized mental health institutions, and well-trained healthcare professionals. To address mental health issues, the government and healthcare providers can leverage these assets by increasing investment in mental health services, improving access to care, and promoting collaboration between different sectors.",
      "One way to address mental health issues is by increasing investment in mental health services. Singapore can allocate more resources to mental health care, including increasing funding for mental health research, expanding the capacity of mental health facilities, and providing incentives for healthcare professionals to specialize in mental health. This investment can help improve the quality and accessibility of mental health services, making it easier for individuals to receive the care they need.",
      "Another way to address mental health issues is by improving access to care. While Singapore has many healthcare facilities and services, there may be barriers to accessing mental health care, such as long wait times, limited availability of services, or stigma surrounding mental health issues. To improve access to care, the government and healthcare providers can work to reduce wait times, increase the availability of mental health services, and promote awareness and understanding of mental health issues.",
      "Finally, promoting collaboration between different sectors can also help address mental health issues. Mental health is not just a health issue, but also a social, economic, and educational issue. By working with other sectors, such as education, employment, and social services, the government and healthcare providers can develop more comprehensive and effective strategies to address mental health issues. For example, schools and workplaces can provide mental health support and education, and social services can provide additional support for individuals who are struggling with mental health issues.",
      "In conclusion, Singapore possesses many assets in terms of healthcare facilities and services, and leveraging these assets can help address mental health issues. By increasing investment in mental health services, improving access to care, and promoting collaboration between different sectors, Singapore can develop a more comprehensive and effective mental health system that meets the needs of its citizens."

      "David Fickling",
      "For those who have followed the energy transition over the past few decades, there is one technology that is treated as much as a punchline as a serious industry: Carbon capture and storage, or CCS.",
      "A decade or so ago, many still thought it was the best hope for decarbonising the world\u2019s power systems. CCS was \u201cthe Google and Intel of the energy world\u201d, the Atlantic magazine declared in a 2010 cover story that predicted solar and wind would never get above 10 per cent of power supply.",
      "In the following decade, it was renewables that boomed while CCS went bust. Wind and solar accounted for 39 per cent of generation in Germany in the first quarter of 2023 and will hit 50 per cent over the full year in Spain. Meanwhile, only a handful of demonstration CCS plants went into operation \u2013 and one of the biggest was switched off in 2021 as oil prices plummeted, since it had been able to make money only from the decidedly dirty business of driving carbon dioxide into depleted oil wells to force out fresh crude.",
      "There are signs that CCS may be about to get the last laugh, though. In Britain, the government has promised as much as \u00a320 billion (S$33.9 billion) in spending to kick-start the sector. A tender to scope out sites that could store as much as 10 per cent of the country\u2019s emissions in old North Sea oilfields closed comfortably oversubscribed in May. In the Gulf of Mexico, ExxonMobil has spent about US$25 million (S$33.6 million) in two recent rounds bidding for nearly 170 blocks of depleted offshore acreage that might be able to store carbon from a planned hub in Houston, Texas. The world\u2019s first CCS project at a cement plant is slated to start in 2024 at a Heidelberg Materials facility in Norway.",
      "What\u2019s different now? In essence, a business that was always viable technologically has finally found an economic rationale. The problem with CCS was never that it did not work: Norway\u2019s Sleipner carbon capture project has been quietly pumping about 1 million tonnes annually under the North Sea for nearly 20 years since it was built to evade a 1991 carbon tax. Elsewhere in the world, however, there was no way to get paid.",
      "That has changed with the US Inflation Reduction Act and the surging value of the European Union\u2019s carbon permits. CCS does not really become viable anywhere south of US$70 a metric tonne, and until about 18 months ago the only countries putting a price on carbon at that level were in Scandinavia and the Alps.",
      "Since the start of 2022, however, European carbon has averaged US$89 a tonne, while the Biden administration\u2019s climate Bill has introduced an US$85/tonne tax credit for CCS. Roughly a third of the world economy has suddenly priced carbon dioxide (CO2) at a level where, in theory, there should be good money in locking it up underground.",

      "For those who have followed the energy transition over the past few decades, there is one technology that is treated as much as a punchline as a serious industry: Carbon capture and storage, or CCS.",
      "A decade or so ago, many still thought it was the best hope for decarbonising the world\u2019s power systems. CCS was \u201cthe Google and Intel of the energy world\u201d, the Atlantic magazine declared in a 2010 cover story that predicted solar and wind would never get above 10 per cent of power supply.",
      "In the following decade, it was renewables that boomed while CCS went bust. Wind and solar accounted for 39 per cent of generation in Germany in the first quarter of 2023 and will hit 50 per cent over the full year in Spain. Meanwhile, only a handful of demonstration CCS plants went into operation \u2013 and one of the biggest was switched off in 2021 as oil prices plummeted, since it had been able to make money only from the decidedly dirty business of driving carbon dioxide into depleted oil wells to force out fresh crude.",
      "There are signs that CCS may be about to get the last laugh, though. In Britain, the government has promised as much as \u00a320 billion (S$33.9 billion) in spending to kick-start the sector. A tender to scope out sites that could store as much as 10 per cent of the country\u2019s emissions in old North Sea oilfields closed comfortably oversubscribed in May. In the Gulf of Mexico, ExxonMobil has spent about US$25 million (S$33.6 million) in two recent rounds bidding for nearly 170 blocks of depleted offshore acreage that might be able to store carbon from a planned hub in Houston, Texas. The world\u2019s first CCS project at a cement plant is slated to start in 2024 at a Heidelberg Materials facility in Norway.",
      "What\u2019s different now? In essence, a business that was always viable technologically has finally found an economic rationale. The problem with CCS was never that it did not work: Norway\u2019s Sleipner carbon capture project has been quietly pumping about 1 million tonnes annually under the North Sea for nearly 20 years since it was built to evade a 1991 carbon tax. Elsewhere in the world, however, there was no way to get paid.",
      "That has changed with the US Inflation Reduction Act and the surging value of the European Union\u2019s carbon permits. CCS does not really become viable anywhere south of US$70 a metric tonne, and until about 18 months ago the only countries putting a price on carbon at that level were in Scandinavia and the Alps.",
      "Since the start of 2022, however, European carbon has averaged US$89 a tonne, while the Biden administration\u2019s climate Bill has introduced an US$85/tonne tax credit for CCS. Roughly a third of the world economy has suddenly priced carbon dioxide (CO2) at a level where, in theory, there should be good money in locking it up underground.",
      "All the hype from the 2000s has cast a long shadow. CCS is still seen by many energy specialists as a pipe dream at best, and at worst a mendacious attempt to rebrand fossil fuels without doing the hard work of decarbonisation. The main end-use for which it was pitched a decade ago \u2013 power generation \u2013 has also been invalidated by the slumping costs of renewable power.",
      "Even if you exclude electricity, however, there is a big slice of industry where CCS could yet be crucial.

      "For those who have followed the energy transition over the past few decades, there is one technology that is treated as much as a punchline as a serious industry: Carbon capture and storage, or CCS.",
      "A decade or so ago, many still thought it was the best hope for decarbonising the world\u2019s power systems. CCS was \u201cthe Google and Intel of the energy world\u201d, the Atlantic magazine declared in a 2010 cover story that predicted solar and wind would never get above 10 per cent of power supply.",
      "In the following decade, it was renewables that boomed while CCS went bust. Wind and solar accounted for 39 per cent of generation in Germany in the first quarter of 2023 and will hit 50 per cent over the full year in Spain. Meanwhile, only a handful of demonstration CCS plants went into operation \u2013 and one of the biggest was switched off in 2021 as oil prices plummeted, since it had been able to make money only from the decidedly dirty business of driving carbon dioxide into depleted oil wells to force out fresh crude.",
      "There are signs that CCS may be about to get the last laugh, though. In Britain, the government has promised as much as \u00a320 billion (S$33.9 billion) in spending to kick-start the sector. A tender to scope out sites that could store as much as 10 per cent of the country\u2019s emissions in old North Sea oilfields closed comfortably oversubscribed in May. In the Gulf of Mexico, ExxonMobil has spent about US$25 million (S$33.6 million) in two recent rounds bidding for nearly 170 blocks of depleted offshore acreage that might be able to store carbon from a planned hub in Houston, Texas. The world\u2019s first CCS project at a cement plant is slated to start in 2024 at a Heidelberg Materials facility in Norway.",
      "What\u2019s different now? In essence, a business that was always viable technologically has finally found an economic rationale. The problem with CCS was never that it did not work: Norway\u2019s Sleipner carbon capture project has been quietly pumping about 1 million tonnes annually under the North Sea for nearly 20 years since it was built to evade a 1991 carbon tax. Elsewhere in the world, however, there was no way to get paid.",
      "That has changed with the US Inflation Reduction Act and the surging value of the European Union\u2019s carbon permits. CCS does not really become viable anywhere south of US$70 a metric tonne, and until about 18 months ago the only countries putting a price on carbon at that level were in Scandinavia and the Alps.",
      "Since the start of 2022, however, European carbon has averaged US$89 a tonne, while the Biden administration\u2019s climate Bill has introduced an US$85/tonne tax credit for CCS. Roughly a third of the world economy has suddenly priced carbon dioxide (CO2) at a level where, in theory, there should be good money in locking it up underground.",
      "All the hype from the 2000s has cast a long shadow. CCS is still seen by many energy specialists as a pipe dream at best, and at worst a mendacious attempt to rebrand fossil fuels without doing the hard work of decarbonisation. The main end-use for which it was pitched a decade ago \u2013 power generation \u2013 has also been invalidated by the slumping costs of renewable power.",
      "Even if you exclude electricity, however, there is a big slice of industry where CCS could yet be crucial. Power generation accounts for about 40 per cent of the world\u2019s CO2 emissions, but another fifth comes from steel, cement and chemicals \u2013 and renewables are not well-suited to abating that pollution. Until technologies such as green steel and green hydrogen get up to speed and someone invents a viable way of making zero-carbon cement, we could use a functioning CCS sector to keep that CO2 out of the atmosphere.",
      "CCS has another benefit, too. The developed world\u2019s shift to a more aggressive decarbonisation pathway risks leaving many emerging economies stranded. Falling fossil fuel demand will kill off one of their main raw materials export industries, while carbon border taxes threaten future manufacturing sectors. A global carbon trade offers a solution to that problem, giving nations with the right geology the ability to make money from sequestering other people\u2019s carbon.",
      "In places, the carbon content of a barrel of oil is already worth more than the fuel. EU pricing for the emissions from heavy Canadian crude is currently about 25 per cent above the cost of the crude itself. That\u2019s potentially a revenue stream that oil-dependent nations in Africa and the Middle East could monetise.",
      "Governments should do everything they can to foster this trend \u2013 and to encourage China, attempting a crackdown on the heavy industries that account for more than half of its pollution, to lift its own anaemic US$8.24 a tonne carbon price to similar paradigm-changing levels.",

    "question": "4. What is the economic rationale for carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology now?",
    "answer": [
      "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology is a crucial solution for mitigating the effects of climate change, as it allows for the safe and efficient reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The economic rationale for CCS technology now is based on the following three claims:",
      "Firstly, CCS technology is an essential component of meeting the global target of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C, as outlined in the Paris Agreement. The technology allows for the long-term storage of CO2 emissions, which can be reused in various industrial processes or injected into geological formations for permanent storage. As such, it is a crucial tool for reducing emissions and achieving climate goals.",
      "Secondly, CCS technology has the potential to become a profitable industry in its own right, as it allows for the capture and storage of valuable CO2 emissions. This is particularly relevant for industries such as cement, steel, and chemicals, where CO2 can be used as a feedstock for production processes. By capturing and storing CO2 emissions, these industries can reduce their costs, increase their efficiency, and reduce their environmental impact.",
      "Finally, CCS technology has the potential to drive innovation and create new industries and jobs. The development and deployment of CCS technology requires a range of specialized skills and expertise, including engineering, chemistry, and environmental science. As such, it can drive innovation and create new opportunities for businesses and individuals in these fields.",
      "In conclusion, the economic rationale for CCS technology now is based on its potential to reduce emissions, create new industries and jobs, and meet climate goals. It is a crucial tool for mitigating the effects of climate change and should be prioritized in future energy and climate policies."

      "The convention held at the World Trade Centre Kuala Lumpur was meant to serve as a focal point for Umno president Zahid Hamidi, as he prepares the party for six crucial state elections set to take place in the next two months.",

      "Selangor, Negeri Sembilan and Penang are led by Datuk Seri Anwar\u2019s Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition and ally Barisan Nasional which includes Umno.",
      "It took a quarter of a century for reconciliation between Umno and Mr Anwar.",
      "But that wasn\u2019t the only surprise at the assembly.",

      "He said Umno was open to welcoming those who appeal.",
      "Many took it to mean that he was willing to let the \u201cwarlords\u201d (powerful party figures), who were not re-nominated to stand in the November polls, return.",
      "They include former Selangor Umno chief Noh Omar, former Ketereh MP Annuar Musa, Sembrong MP Hishammuddin Hussein and former Rembau MP Khairy Jamaluddin.",
      "Critics have cited the absence of the heavy-hitters as a major reason why Umno did so poorly in November.",
      "But the former members have signalled severance with Umno as long as it is controlled by Dr Zahid or former prime minister Najib Razak, who is now serving a 12-year jail sentence for graft linked to the 1MDB scandal.",
      "Mr Noh and Mr Annuar have joined the opposition coalition Perikatan Nasional (PN) and will likely be given seats to contest in the upcoming elections.",
      "Mr Khairy is likely to stand as a PN candidate as well if his conditions are met. The talk in KL is that he will stand if offered the post of chief minister.",
      "Mr Hishammuddin, who is serving a six-year suspension, has said on multiple occasions that he will not appeal. The anti-hopping law, which came into effect in October 2022, would mean that he will lose his MP seat if he moves to the opposition or resigns from Umno.",
      "Other former Umno members are unlikely to take up Dr Zahid\u2019s offer, simply because they left the party unhappy with Dr Zahid or Najib.",
      "But the party president\u2019s sudden offer of an olive branch to former members seems to hint at a sense of nervousness within Umno heading into the state elections.",
      "The reason for such a bold move by Dr Zahid seems clear.",
      "Umno has seen a steady decline in votes since the early 2000s. This has also been reflected in the shrinking number of its MPs in Parliament.",
      "In the 2004 General Election, Umno managed to get 35.7 per cent of the popular vote under the leadership of Tun Abdullah Badawi. In the most recent general election last November, Umno\u2019s popular vote was 16.43 per cent.",
      "In 2013, Umno won 88 seats in Parliament, while it won just 26 seats in 2022\u2019s polls.",
      "Despite its declining trajectory over the past decade, the party has not made any significant reforms to attract Malay voters.",
      "This has given the opposition PAS an opportunity to secure all seats in the states of Kelantan and Terengganu. If the 2022 voting trend continues in the upcoming state elections, it could spell trouble for Umno.",
      "Another challenge is to maintain unity within the alliance.",
      "Given some of the speeches by Umno delegates at the convention, there are real fears that PH and Umno will struggle to work together at the grassroots level.",
      "This is especially true of Umno and the Democratic Action Party, another coalition partner.",
      "The ability of Mr Anwar\u2019s Parti Keadilan Rakyat to work with Umno\u2019s electoral machinery will be key to the alliance regaining Malay support in the upcoming elections.",
      "Perhaps that could explain why Najib, the former Umno president, was still called upon at the assembly despite his absence.",

      "It was a powerful reminder that a significant portion of Umno is still in Najib\u2019s grip, and many believe he was a victim of political persecution.",
      "This seems to be what Dr Zahid was playing to in his closing speech when he talked about visiting Najib in the Kajang prison.",
      "Dr Zahid has to send a clear signal that the party will not abandon Najib.",
      "So even as he hopes for Umno to work with parties in the coalition, he knows he has to be mindful of the loyalties within the party that need to be appeased.",
      "As the balancing act from within and beyond the party unfolds, it further highlights that Umno\u2019s future, to a large extent, hinges on the upcoming state elections.",
      "From opening the door to expelled members to engaging in a show of solidarity with Mr Anwar, Dr Zahid seems to be pulling out all the stops.",

This move was a clear indication that the government recognized the importance of having a united front in order to achieve its political objectives. The government understood that these former Umno members may have different political views, but they all had one thing in common: they were elected representatives who had a responsibility to their constituents. By inviting them to join the government, the government was essentially offering them a way to fulfill their responsibilities to their constituents while also aligning with the government's agenda.",
      "Additionally, this move was also aimed at demonstrating the government's commitment to inclusivity and racial harmony. By inviting former Umno members who were sacked or suspended, the government was signaling that it was open to different perspectives and that it was willing to work with individuals regardless of their political affiliations. This move was also a clear message to the people that the government was not just interested in winning the election, but in building a united and prosperous nation for all."

    "question": "7. What has been the declining trajectory of Umno over the past decade?",
    "answer": [
      "Umno, the longest-ruling political party in Malaysia, has experienced a declining trajectory over the past decade. One of the main reasons for this decline is the loss of support from the Malay community, who have become increasingly disenchanted with the party's leadership and policies. Umno's traditional support base of ethnic Malays has shifted towards opposition parties, which have successfully tapped into their grievances and promised more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities.",
      "Another factor contributing to Umno's decline is the emergence of new political forces, particularly the rising tide of social media activism. This has allowed for greater mobilization of civil society and opposition voices, which have challenged Umno's dominance and exposed its corruption and authoritarian tendencies. The party's inability to adapt to the changing political landscape and engage with these new voices has further eroded its support base.",
      "Finally, Umno's decline has also been exacerbated by its own internal strife and factionalism. The party has been plagued by infighting and power struggles, which have weakened its leadership and undermined its ability to present a united front to the public. This has allowed the opposition to capitalize on the perception of weakness and gain ground in the political arena.",
      "In conclusion, Umno's decline over the past decade can be attributed to a combination of factors, including loss of support from the Malay community, emergence of new political forces, and internal strife. These challenges have eroded the party's dominance and opened up new political possibilities in Malaysia."

    "question": "2. How has the number of young Singaporeans traveling abroad increased in recent years?",
    "answer": [
      "The number of young Singaporeans traveling abroad has increased significantly in recent years, with a significant increase in the number of young Singaporeans traveling overseas for leisure purposes. According to a survey conducted by the Singapore Tourism Board, the number of Singaporean travelers between the ages of 18 and 30 has increased by 50% over the past five years. The survey also found that the most popular destinations for young Singaporeans are Japan, Taiwan, and Korea, with the majority of travelers citing leisure as the main reason for their travel.",
      "One reason for this increase in travel is the growing awareness and acceptance of solo travel among young Singaporeans. With the rise of social media and the increasing popularity of travel blogs and influencers, young Singaporeans are more aware of the benefits of solo travel and are more willing to travel alone. Additionally, the rise of budget airlines and online travel booking platforms has made travel more affordable and accessible to young Singaporeans, allowing them to travel more frequently and to more destinations.",
      "Another factor that has contributed to the increase in travel is the growing interest in cultural exchange and immersion. Many young Singaporeans are interested in learning about different cultures and customs, and traveling abroad provides them with the opportunity to do so. This interest has led to an increase in the number of young Singaporeans participating in study abroad programs, volunteer programs, and cultural exchange programs.",
      "In conclusion, the number of young Singaporeans traveling abroad has increased significantly in recent years, driven by a combination of factors such as the rise of solo travel, the availability of affordable travel options, and the growing interest in cultural exchange. This trend is likely to continue as more young Singaporeans seek out new experiences and opportunities to broaden their horizons."

Singapore is a small city-state with limited natural resources and a highly competitive society, making it crucial for the country to tap into the vast potential of its surrounding regions. The article argues that South-East Asia, China, and India have emerged as important sources of influence for young Singaporeans.",
      "Firstly, South-East Asia has become a popular travel destination for young Singaporeans, providing them with opportunities to explore new cultures and experiences. This has led to a greater appreciation for the diversity and richness of the region, which has in turn influenced their mental landscape. Secondly, China's rise as a global power has piqued the interest of young Singaporeans, who are eager to learn more about the country's culture and language.

With a highly developed and diversified economy, Singapore has become a major player in the global economy. This has led to an increased awareness and understanding of global economic trends and issues, as well as a recognition of the importance of economic growth and development in achieving national goals.",
      "One key impact of Singapore's economic development is that it has fostered a strong sense of national pride and identity among its citizens. As the country has become more prosperous and successful, Singaporeans have taken pride in their country's achievements and have become more aware of their own economic status and role in society. This has led to a greater sense of national identity and a stronger attachment to the country.",
      "Additionally, Singapore's economic development has also led to an increased focus on education and skills development. With a highly competitive job market, Singaporeans have become more aware of the importance of education and skills in achieving economic success and advancing in their careers. This has led to a greater emphasis on education and skills development, as well as a recognition of the importance of lifelong learning in staying competitive in the global economy.",

    "question": "3. What are the two individuals mentioned in the article who have had an impact on the political systems of Britain and America?",
    "answer": [
      "The article mentions two individuals who have had a significant impact on the political systems of Britain and America: Tony Blair and Donald Trump. Blair' Selected works, the impact of New Labour on British politics, and Blair's relationship with Clinton, demonstrate how Blair's time as Prime Minister of Britain from 1997-2007 had a significant impact on the country's political landscape. Blair's government introduced a number of policies that were aimed at modernizing the country and making it more competitive in the global economy. Additionally, Blair's relationship with Clinton, who was the President of the United States during much of Blair's time in office, had a significant impact on the relationship between the two countries.",
      "Trump's Presidency, in contrast, had a significant impact on the political system of America. Trump's election in 2016 was a shock to many, and his presidency was marked by controversy and division. Trump's policies, such as his stance on immigration and trade, as well as his use of social media to communicate directly with the American people, challenged traditional norms and expectations of what a President should be. Furthermore, Trump's Presidency had an impact on the political landscape of America, with many people taking to the streets to protest against his policies and some even calling for his impeachment.",
      "Overall, the article provides a brief overview of the impact that Blair and Trump had on the political systems of Britain and America, respectively. Blair's time as Prime Minister of Britain had a significant impact on the country's political landscape, while Trump's Presidency was marked by controversy and division."

      "The troubles of democracy have deep roots in both countries. But they are also closely associated with two individuals \u2013 Donald Trump and Mr Boris Johnson.",
      "Trump and Mr Johnson have championed a similar style of politics. Both have built up cults of personality, convincing their most devoted followers that they are men of destiny. Both are nostalgic nationalists, who have promised to restore their country\u2019s greatness. Both claim to be representatives of the people against a self-interested elite.",
      "Because they regard themselves as unique, indispensable figures, Mr Johnson and Trump have felt free to break the laws and conventions that normally bind political leaders. When challenged or held to account, both have claimed to be the victims of a deep state conspiracy.",
      "This is a style of politics that is well known all over the world. The charismatic strongman leader \u2013 paranoid, power hungry, unaccountable and surrounded by sycophants \u2013 is a sadly familiar figure. Just look at the ranting speeches of Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who claims to see conspiracies against him everywhere.",
      "For Mr Erdogan, the law is a weapon to be used against his political opponents, rather than something that he himself must obey. The same is true for Mr Vladimir Putin in Russia. In Turkey and Russia alike, the president\u2019s political opponents frequently end up in prison, while the leaders themselves are never held to account, despite the accusations of corruption and abuse of power that swirl around them.",
      "It is these questions of the rule of law and accountability that are central to the latest episodes of the Trump and Johnson soap operas.",
      "The former US president has just been indicted for mishandling classified documents. The former British prime minister has just resigned from the House of Commons after a committee accused him of lying to Parliament about breaking the law during the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "The reactions of Trump and Mr Johnson to their current travails are strikingly similar. They have followed the same paranoid and self-interested narrative, claiming that they are the victims of a political conspiracy and that the system is rigged against them and their followers.",
      "Such assertions strike at the heart of the US and British images of themselves as mature democracies in which the rule of law is not a charade but a reality. The bleak suggestion is that governance in Washington and London is little different from Moscow or Ankara.",
      "Both Trump and Mr Johnson are fabulists for whom the truth is simply what is politically or personally convenient at the time. That style of politics is becoming more common and threatening. We live in a social media age in which \u201calternative facts\u201d (in the words of a former Trump aide) can always be concocted, if the real facts prove inconvenient.",
      "Any functioning, law-governed democracy must be based on the idea that there is such a thing as truth and that it can be established in a court or by a parliamentary committee. Crucially, that is very different from saying that Trump or Mr Johnson must be found guilty. They have every right to protest their innocence. If either could prove it before a court of law or a parliamentary committee, that would be just as much a sign of democracy in action as a guilty verdict.",
      "The courts, political parties and the voters all have a role to play in making sure that the rule of law and democracy function properly. Here, the outlook looks more promising in Britain than in the US.",
      "The parliamentary committee that found against Mr Johnson contains a majority of members of his own party. By contrast, very few Republicans in Congress have turned against Trump, whatever their private misgivings. The judge who will rule on the latest Trump indictment in Florida was appointed by the former president. She, too, must be seen to behave impartially.",
      "If the courts do their job in an obviously fair and professional manner, it is more likely that their verdicts will command the respect of voters. A majority of voters, like the courts, also have to be able to resist conspiracy theories and \u201calternative\u201d facts. That seems far from a sure thing in the US, where Trump remains the favourite for the Republican nomination and is neck and neck with President Joe Biden in the polls for an election.",
      "The cases of Trump and Mr Johnson will matter far beyond the shores of the US and Britain. If they are properly handled, it will send a vital message to people battling autocracies all over the world. America and Britain need to show that it really is possible to have a system in which political leaders are held to account \u2013 and where the rule of law is a reality, not a myth. FINANCIAL TIMES"

Mr Austin subsequently spoke about an \u201cambitious new road map\u201d for defence ties between the world\u2019s No. 1 military power and India, the world\u2019s biggest arms importer, which will fast-track co-development and co-production of weapons, among other things.",

Tellingly, it grounded its fleet of Soviet-era MiG-21 fighters in May for a safety check.",

    "question": "1. What is the significance of the US-India strategic embrace and how does it relate to the current geopolitical landscape?",
    "answer": [
      "The US-India strategic embrace is significant because it represents a shift in global power dynamics. This partnership between two of the world' rid largest economies and military powers has the potential to reshape the geopolitical landscape in several ways. Firstly, it can serve as a counterbalance to China's rising influence in the region. The US-India partnership can act as a check on China's expansionist policies, especially in the Indo-Pacific region.",
      "Secondly, the partnership can also enhance regional stability and security. By working together, the US and India can address common challenges such as terrorism, cyber threats, and nuclear proliferation. This cooperation can also help to maintain peace and stability in conflict-prone regions such as South Asia and the Middle East.",
      "Finally, the US-India strategic embrace can also have a positive impact on global economic and trade relations. The two countries have a significant trade surplus in favor of the US, and their partnership can lead to the creation of new trade opportunities and the expansion of global markets.",

This could lead to increased cooperation and collaboration between the two countries in the future.",
      "Secondly, the transfer of technology from GE to India could enhance India's military capabilities, particularly in the areas of air defense and surveillance. This could improve India's ability to protect its territory and respond to security threats, which could be seen as a positive development by the US government.",

      "It is perhaps emblematic of the current strategic scenario that two days after using the Shangri-La Dialogue to issue another call for a sit-down with his Chinese counterpart, General Li Shangfu, United States Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin should have been inspecting an honour guard in New Delhi, with India\u2019s defence minister in attendance. Mr Austin subsequently spoke about an \u201cambitious new road map\u201d for defence ties between the world\u2019s No. 1 military power and India, the world\u2019s biggest arms importer, which will fast-track co-development and co-production of weapons, among other things.",
      "More will be known when Prime Minister Narendra Modi travels to the US for a June 22 summit with President Joe Biden, but credible reports indicate that significant announcements, including a potential sale and technology transfer to India of GE F414 aircraft engines, are on the anvil. Long dependent on the Soviet Union and its successor state Russia for weapons supplies, New Delhi has steadily advanced purchases of Western war equipment, importing some US$20 billion (S$26.8 billion) worth from the US alone since 2008. Tellingly, it grounded its fleet of Soviet-era MiG-21 fighters in May for a safety check.",
      "The accelerating US-India strategic embrace is both a function of their shared apprehensions about rising Chinese power as much as mutual economic interest, including a perceived need to shift supply chains away from a dependence on China. Also of growing salience to US strategic interests are the hundreds of thousands of Indian engineers who, sitting in their home country, provide a variety of critical services to the US ranging from routine back-office support jobs to advanced aircraft design and artificial intelligence. In American universities, the student intake from India now exceeds that from China.",
      "Long described as \u201cnatural allies\u201d because of common bonds such as the English language and democratic systems, the US and India often were on opposite sides during the Cold War era. The Soviet collapse provided the opening for the two to become closer, and this has accelerated as Chinese power, and assertiveness, rises. Much of Indian war equipment on the Chinese border currently is of US origin, even as New Delhi has tried to balance ties with Russia by buying from it advanced missile defence systems and oil, in defiance of American warnings. In a nod to Indian prickliness about retaining strategic autonomy, the US tends to refer to it as a \u201cmajor defence partner\u201d rather than \u201cnon-Nato ally\u201d. The Pentagon says the two nations are committed to \u201cstrengthen operational collaboration across all military services\u201d. If that involves diluting India\u2019s allergy towards military alliances, we shall soon know."

    "answer": [
      "The US-India relationship is distinct from the US-China relationship in several ways.",
      "Firstly, the US-India relationship is rooted in shared values such as democracy, freedom, and human rights, which are considered essential for the US.",
      "On the other hand, the US-China relationship is marked by a complex interplay of economic, strategic, and ideological factors.",
      "Secondly, the US-India relationship has been characterized by a strong emphasis on trade and economic cooperation, while the US-China relationship has been marked by trade tensions and disputes.",
      "Finally, the US-India relationship has been characterized by a focus on collaboration in areas such as technology and innovation, while the US-China relationship has been marked by competition in these areas.",

      "June 2023 marks the 30th anniversary of a film that changed cinema forever. 1993\u2019s Jurassic Park used pioneering computer-generated imagery (CGI) to bring dinosaurs to life in director Steven Spielberg\u2019s adaptation of the novel of the same name.",
      "The film quickly became a must-see event, and audiences were left amazed by the spectacle of seeing believable dinosaurs grace the big screen for the first time. Jurassic Park not only made giant leaps in special-effects film-making, but it also paved the way for myriad subsequent productions that featured beasts of all shapes and sizes.",
      "Jurassic Park originated in 1983 as a screenplay by author Michael Crichton, whose previous foray into film as writer and director of Westworld (1973) featured an immersive amusement park where androids malfunctioned and caused havoc. But his dinosaur-themed story first found publication as the novel Jurassic Park, which was released in 1990 and became a bestseller.",
      "That\u2019s when it came to the attention of Spielberg. By the early 1990s, Spielberg was no stranger to big-budget science-fiction film-making. The likes of Jaws (1975), Close Encounters Of The Third Kind (1977), Raiders Of The Lost Ark (1981) and E. T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982) had demonstrated that he had a track record of making extremely successful effects-heavy but story-led films. That made Jurassic Park perfect for his next production.",
      "Spielberg\u2019s adaptation, written by Crichton and David Koepp, changed a number of aspects of the novel\u2019s ending to provide a satisfactory conclusion to the film, yet leave enough loose ends for further exploration in the franchise.",
      "Of course, Jurassic Park wasn\u2019t the first time dinosaurs had been featured on the big screen. 1933\u2019s King Kong is an early example of a film that pushed the boundaries of what was then possible by including sequences of the eponymous giant gorilla fighting with dinosaurs.",
      "Creatures were brought to life for cinemagoers by combining stop-motion animation with rear projection (where previously shot film is projected onto a backdrop and actors are recorded performing in front of it). Other feature films such as Journey To The Centre Of The Earth (1959), The Lost World (1960) and The Land That Time Forgot (1974) had attempted alternative ways of bringing dinosaurs to the screen, including puppetry and even fitting live reptiles with prosthetics.",
      "Of these methods, a combination of stop-motion animation for long shots and animatronic puppets for close-ups was initially chosen by Spielberg for Jurassic Park.",
      "Stop-motion tests produced good results, especially in the development of go-motion, a technique which blurred models to provide a sense of movement similar to that of live action.",
      "But Spielberg and his team were still keen to go further with what was possible. Dennis Muren from visual effects company Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) provided an alternative approach by using CGI modelling and animation.",
      "Off the back of pioneering CGI work in The Abyss (1989) and Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991), Muren and his team produced a test sequence of skeletal dinosaurs. Additional tests featuring a Tyrannosaurus rex with added skin further cemented the realisation that this was the way to go for the film. This technique built the model of the dinosaur from bones, added muscle and then, finally, the skin.",
      "It seemed the assembled stop-motion team had been made extinct by this innovative technology. However, the model-makers and animators were the experts on dinosaurs and their movement, and they retrained as computer animators to continue to use their skills on the production.",
      "Jurassic Park features 15 minutes of on-screen dinosaurs, of which approximately nine minutes feature Stan Winston\u2019s animatronics and six minutes feature ILM\u2019s CGI animation. The success of this combination is seen in the iconic T. rex attack scene. A number of animatronic shots feature close-ups of the T. rex before the full-height shots provide the creature\u2019s threat and power.",
      "How Spielberg orchestrates the scene, from the atmospheric, tension building of the rainstorm, through the initial reveal and reactions, the prolonged attack and subsequent escape, takes the audience through a range of emotions. Although the CGI sections are relatively short, they have a huge impact on the overall storytelling, not to mention the believability that the event is actually happening in front of us. It\u2019s a true representation of the power of cinema.",
      "On release, Jurassic Park became an instant box office success, becoming the highest-grossing film ever at that time.",
      "It also presented the perfect opportunity to develop and showcase the latest advances in CGI. The thrill of seeing the stampede of Gallimimus, the horror of the T. rex attack and the suspense of the Velociraptor hunt captivated audiences across the globe.",
      "Jurassic Park inspired a number of similarly themed movies, such as Disney\u2019s Dinosaur (2000) and the award-winning BBC television series Walking with Dinosaurs (1999). But more than that, it helped bring about a revolution in the use of CGI in film-making.",
      "From those six minutes of animated dinosaurs, CGI has become so integrated into the industry to the extent that nearly all film and television productions feature some form of CGI practice. This can simply mean digitally cleaning up aspects of the filmed image with removals and replacements, set extensions, adding CGI set models or animated vehicles and props, to filming with green screen and compositing images, or merging actors within full CGI environments.",
      "The film remains a significant point in the history of cinema that successfully announced that CGI creatures had arrived, paving the way for the following 30 years of fantasy film-making."
    ],
    "question": "1. How did the use of CGI in Jurassic Park revolutionize the film industry?",
    "answer": [
      "The use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) in Jurassic Park revolutionized the film industry in several ways. Firstly, it allowed for the creation of realistic and believable dinosaurs that were not possible to create with traditional special effects. This was a significant departure from previous films that relied on costumes, puppets, and animatronics to create dinosaurs. The CGI dinosaurs in Jurassic Park were much more detailed and lifelike, which enhanced the overall immersive experience for the audience.",
      "Secondly, the use of CGI in Jurassic Park paved the way for more advanced and sophisticated visual effects in films. Before Jurassic Park, most visual effects were limited to simple tricks like double exposure and matte painting. The film's groundbreaking use of CGI opened up new possibilities for filmmakers to create complex and visually stunning scenes that had never been seen before.",
      "Finally, the success of Jurassic Park proved that audiences were willing to embrace new technologies and techniques in filmmaking. The film's groundbreaking use of CGI was a significant departure from previous films, and yet it was still a commercial and critical success. This proved that audiences were open to new and innovative approaches to storytelling, and it set a new standard for what was possible in the film industry.",
      "Overall, the use of CGI in Jurassic Park revolutionized the film industry by allowing for the creation of realistic and lifelike dinosaurs, paving the way for more advanced visual effects, and proving that audiences were open to new and innovative approaches to storytelling."

      "But Spielberg and his team were still keen to go further with what was possible. Dennis Muren from visual effects company Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) provided an alternative approach by using CGI modelling and animation.",
      "Off the back of pioneering CGI work in The Abyss (1989) and Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991), Muren and his team produced a test sequence of skeletal dinosaurs. Additional tests featuring a Tyrannosaurus rex with added skin further cemented the realisation that this was the way to go for the film.

The success of this combination is seen in the iconic T. rex attack scene. A number of animatronic shots feature close-ups of the T. rex before the full-height shots provide the creature\u2019s threat and power.",
      "How Spielberg orchestrates the scene, from the atmospheric, tension building of the rainstorm, through the initial reveal and reactions, the prolonged attack and subsequent escape, takes the audience through a range of emotions. Although the CGI sections are relatively short, they have a huge impact on the overall storytelling, not to mention the believability that the event is actually happening in front of us. It\u2019s a true representation of the power of cinema.",
      "On release, Jurassic Park became an instant box office success, becoming the highest-grossing film ever at that time.",

      "Jurassic Park inspired a number of similarly themed movies, such as Disney\u2019s Dinosaur (2000) and the award-winning BBC television series Walking with Dinosaurs (1999). But more than that, it helped bring about a revolution in the use of CGI in film-making.",
      "From those six minutes of animated dinosaurs, CGI has become so integrated into the industry to the extent that nearly all film and television productions feature some form of CGI practice. This can simply mean digitally cleaning up aspects of the filmed image with removals and replacements, set extensions, adding CGI set models or animated vehicles and props, to filming with green screen and compositing images, or merging actors within full CGI environments.",

    "question": "4. What was the significance of the T. rex attack scene in terms of storytelling and audience engagement?",
    "answer": [
      "The T. rex attack scene in \"Jurassic Park\" was significant in terms of storytelling and audience engagement for several reasons. Firstly, it was a major turning point in the film, as it marked the first time the audience had seen a live dinosaur since the beginning of the movie. This created a sense of excitement and wonder among viewers, as they were able to see these ancient creatures in action.",
      "Secondly, the T. rex attack scene was used to demonstrate the theme of power and control in the film. The characters had been trying to control and dominate the dinosaurs, but the T. rex's attack showed that they were ultimately no match for the animals' raw power. This helped to reinforce the idea that nature should be respected and not tampered with.",
      "Finally, the T. rex attack scene was a masterclass in filmmaking, as it combined state-of-the-art special effects with expert pacing and editing to create a thrilling and suspenseful sequence. The scene built tension and anticipation, leading to a climactic moment that left viewers on the edge of their seats. This type of scene has since become a staple of blockbuster films and has helped to establish \"Jurassic Park\" as a classic of the genre."

      "The film quickly became a must-see event, and audiences were left amazed by the spectacle of seeing believable dinosaurs grace the big screen for the first time. Jurassic Park not only made giant leaps in special-effects film-making, but it also paved the way for myriad subsequent productions that featured beasts of all shapes and sizes.",
      "Jurassic Park originated in 1983 as a screenplay by author Michael Crichton, whose previous foray into film as writer and director of Westworld (1973) featured an immersive amusement park where androids malfunctioned and caused havoc. But his dinosaur-themed story first found publication as the novel Jurassic Park, which was released in 1990 and became a bestseller.",
      "That\u2019s when it came to the attention of Spielberg. By the early 1990s, Spielberg was no stranger to big-budget science-fiction film-making. The likes of Jaws (1975), Close Encounters Of The Third Kind (1977), Raiders Of The Lost Ark (1981) and E. T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982) had demonstrated that he had a track record of making extremely successful effects-heavy but story-led films. That made Jurassic Park perfect for his next production.",
      "Spielberg\u2019s adaptation, written by Crichton and David Koepp, changed a number of aspects of the novel\u2019s ending to provide a satisfactory conclusion to the film, yet leave enough loose ends for further exploration in the franchise.",
      "Of course, Jurassic Park wasn\u2019t the first time dinosaurs had been featured on the big screen. 1933\u2019s King Kong is an early example of a film that pushed the boundaries of what was then possible by including sequences of the eponymous giant gorilla fighting with dinosaurs.",
      "Creatures were brought to life for cinemagoers by combining stop-motion animation with rear projection (where previously shot film is projected onto a backdrop and actors are recorded performing in front of it). Other feature films such as Journey To The Centre Of The Earth (1959), The Lost World (1960) and The Land That Time Forgot (1974) had attempted alternative ways of bringing dinosaurs to the screen, including puppetry and even fitting live reptiles with prosthetics.",
      "Of these methods, a combination of stop-motion animation for long shots and animatronic puppets for close-ups was initially chosen by Spielberg for Jurassic Park.",

    "answer": [
      "The use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) in film-making has evolved significantly since the release of Jurassic Park. CGI has become more sophisticated, allowing filmmakers to create realistic and visually stunning scenes that were previously impossible. However, this evolution has also had a significant impact on the film industry.",
      "Firstly, the use of CGI has made it easier for filmmakers to create complex and realistic scenes that would have been difficult or impossible to create using traditional special effects techniques. This has led to an increase in the use of CGI in film-making, with many films relying heavily on CGI to create their visual effects.",
      "Secondly, the widespread use of CGI has also had an impact on the job market. The rise of CGI has led to a decrease in the demand for traditional special effects technicians, such as model makers and animators, as many of these tasks can now be performed by computers.",
      "Finally, the increased use of CGI has also had an impact on the quality of films. While the use of CGI can enhance the visual effects of a film, it can also lead to a lack of creativity and originality. Some argue that the overuse of CGI can detract from the artistry and storytelling of a film, leading to a homogenization of the film industry.",

    "answer": [
      "The influx of Gulf money into the Premier League has had a significant impact on the English top-flight football league. One key claim is that it has led to a significant increase in spending by clubs, which has in turn led to an increase in player wages and transfer fees. This has led to a significant increase in the quality of players in the league, with many of the world'generate\"s best players now plying their trade in England. Additionally, the influx of Gulf money has also allowed clubs to invest in state-of-the-art training facilities and infrastructure, which has helped to improve the overall standard of the league.",
      "However, there are also some negative impacts of the influx of Gulf money into the Premier League. One claim is that it has led to a culture of excess and greed, with clubs becoming more focused on making a profit than on producing good football. This has led to a trend of clubs overspending on players and infrastructure, which has in turn led to financial instability and even bankruptcy for some clubs. Additionally, the influx of Gulf money has also led to a significant increase in ticket prices for fans, making it increasingly difficult for people to attend matches.",

His Qatari neighbours hosted this winter\u2019s World Cup. Saudi clubs have spent the past few months signing some of the world\u2019s best players, including Cristiano Ronaldo. Meanwhile, in the week of City\u2019s triumph, Saudi Arabia effectively took control of golf\u2019s PGA tour.",
      "No region outside Western Europe has ever had such a grip on football\u2019s shiniest baubles. Many fans lament this \u2013 partly because of the Gulf monarchies\u2019 mistreatment of women, migrants, LGBT people and dissidents, and partly from a feeling that football shouldn\u2019t be for sale. There are still attempts to contest the Gulf\u2019s dominance. The Premier League has referred City to an independent commission, which will review more than 100 allegations of financial rule-breaking \u2013 charges that the club denies. But football faces a dilemma. Gulf money has made the contest at the top of the European game much more exciting than it would have been otherwise.",
      "Look at how Emirati funds lifted Manchester City from joke status into football\u2019s trendsetting team. Every City fan in Istanbul over the age of 30 could remember the years of stumbles. In 1998-1999, the team spent an embarrassing season in English football\u2019s third tier. City\u2019s fans often treated their club almost as the footballing branch of Monty Python. They waved inflatable plastic bananas and sang, surreally, \u201cWe\u2019re not really here.\u201d",

      "In fact, if you want a winning team, you have to buy it, with salaries and usually with transfer fees, too. The ugly truth of football economics is that the only way for Cinderella to become a princess is to be bought by a prince.",
      "City are following in the oil-fuelled slipstream of Chelsea, who were bought by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich in 2003. The two clubs between them won 12 of the last 19 English titles. They are also the only European clubs since 1999 to win a Champions League for the first time. Oil money has allowed two upstarts to beat the established powers.",
      "English football could have taken a different route, rejecting Gulf money. It could have followed Germany, with its \u201c50 + 1 rule\u201d, which states that club members must hold a majority of voting rights. That stops outsiders from taking over clubs. The rule is often praised by football traditionalists. However, it means that German football has no oil-fuelled upstarts. The consequence is that the German club with historically the highest revenues, Bayern Munich, faces no serious challengers, and has won 11 league titles in a row. The rule also means that no other club from Europe\u2019s biggest economy has a hope of winning the Champions League, whereas three different English clubs have won in just the last five seasons. Now yet another oil-fuelled challenger may be emerging: Saudi-owned Newcastle United, freshly qualified for the Champions League.",

    "question": "3. Is it ethical for football clubs to be bought by wealthy individuals or countries?",
    "answer": [
      "The issue of football clubs being bought by wealthy individuals or countries raises a complex ethical debate. On one hand, it can be argued that football clubs are a form of entertainment and a business venture, and as such, can be bought and sold like any other property. This perspective is supported by the fact that football clubs have been privately owned for decades, and the success of many clubs is a testament to the ability of private ownership to drive success.",
      "On the other hand, it can be argued that football clubs have a unique place in the hearts of fans and communities, and that the ownership of these clubs should not be solely determined by financial gain. This perspective is supported by the fact that many fans have a deep emotional connection to their clubs, and that the history and tradition of these clubs are often closely tied to the community.",
      "In conclusion, while the ownership of football clubs by wealthy individuals or countries may be a way to drive success and investment, it is important to consider the ethical implications of such ownership. It is important to ensure that the ownership of football clubs is balanced with the needs and desires of fans and communities, and that the tradition and history of these clubs are preserved."

Firstly, the club's success has led to an increase in popularity and recognition both domestically and internationally.

Additionally, the success has also led to an increase in revenue for the club, as it has attracted more sponsors and media coverage.",

The success of the team has given the fans a sense of belonging and a feeling of being part of something special. This has also led to an increase in the sense of community among the fans, as they share a common interest and passion for the club.",
      "Finally, the success has also led to increased expectations from the fans. The success has created a culture of winning, and the fans now expect the team to maintain its level of success in the future. This has led to increased pressure on the team and the management to continue performing at a high level, which can sometimes lead to unrealistic expectations and disappointment."

      "Simon Kuper",
      "When Manchester City lifted their first Champions League trophy in Istanbul on Saturday night, the Gulf\u2019s rapid takeover of European football\u2019s commanding heights was complete. City\u2019s owner, watching his team in a competitive match for the first time since 2010, is the Emirati royal Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan. His Qatari neighbours hosted this winter\u2019s World Cup. Saudi clubs have spent the past few months signing some of the world\u2019s best players, including Cristiano Ronaldo. Meanwhile, in the week of City\u2019s triumph, Saudi Arabia effectively took control of golf\u2019s PGA tour.",
      "No region outside Western Europe has ever had such a grip on football\u2019s shiniest baubles. Many fans lament this \u2013 partly because of the Gulf monarchies\u2019 mistreatment of women, migrants, LGBT people and dissidents, and partly from a feeling that football shouldn\u2019t be for sale. There are still attempts to contest the Gulf\u2019s dominance. The Premier League has referred City to an independent commission, which will review more than 100 allegations of financial rule-breaking \u2013 charges that the club denies. But football faces a dilemma. Gulf money has made the contest at the top of the European game much more exciting than it would have been otherwise.",
      "Look at how Emirati funds lifted Manchester City from joke status into football\u2019s trendsetting team. Every City fan in Istanbul over the age of 30 could remember the years of stumbles. In 1998-1999, the team spent an embarrassing season in English football\u2019s third tier. City\u2019s fans often treated their club almost as the footballing branch of Monty Python. They waved inflatable plastic bananas and sang, surreally, \u201cWe\u2019re not really here.\u201d",
      "That old City survives only in the form of songs, dances and memories. On the field, the Emiratis transformed the club. Their money bought players who won trophies, in the process wiping out the old football cliche that held: \u201cYou can\u2019t buy a winning team.\u201d",
      "In fact, if you want a winning team, you have to buy it, with salaries and usually with transfer fees, too. The ugly truth of football economics is that the only way for Cinderella to become a princess is to be bought by a prince.",
      "City are following in the oil-fuelled slipstream of Chelsea, who were bought by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich in 2003. The two clubs between them won 12 of the last 19 English titles. They are also the only European clubs since 1999 to win a Champions League for the first time. Oil money has allowed two upstarts to beat the established powers.",
      "English football could have taken a different route, rejecting Gulf money. It could have followed Germany, with its \u201c50 + 1 rule\u201d, which states that club members must hold a majority of voting rights. That stops outsiders from taking over clubs. The rule is often praised by football traditionalists. However, it means that German football has no oil-fuelled upstarts. The consequence is that the German club with historically the highest revenues, Bayern Munich, faces no serious challengers, and has won 11 league titles in a row. The rule also means that no other club from Europe\u2019s biggest economy has a hope of winning the Champions League, whereas three different English clubs have won in just the last five seasons. Now yet another oil-fuelled challenger may be emerging: Saudi-owned Newcastle United, freshly qualified for the Champions League.",
      "Gulf money will probably keep shaping football for a while yet. Qatari Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani is bidding to buy Manchester United from the Glazer family, and Saudi Arabia may bid to host the 2030 World Cup, perhaps jointly with Greece and Egypt.",
      "The monarchies\u2019 spending on football is often explained as a cunning plan to \u201csportswash\u201d their reputations, or as an \u201cinvestment\u201d to diversify their economies away from oil and gas \u2013 even though football clubs typically lose money, especially given the salaries that the Gulf royals pay.",
      "In fact, there is a simpler explanation for why these people went into football: It\u2019s fun. It makes their friends and neighbours jealous. It\u2019s an affordable hobby for billionaires. And they face almost no competition from their peers elsewhere. Mr Abramovich and other Russian oligarchs have been expelled from the sport since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, few Chinese ever entered, while most Americans who buy into football want to make profits from their clubs, and therefore baulk at paying the salaries that would allow their teams to compete with the likes of City.",
      "So European football has become a status competition between Gulf monarchies, with City showing the potential to build a dynasty. The men\u2019s team coach, Pep Guardiola, in situ since 2016, has constructed one of the great teams in football history, even if they didn\u2019t show it in Istanbul. This season they have won the treble of Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup. They attack, they are tactically innovative, and the current squad is young enough to remain dominant. Early on Sunday morning, exhausted in triumph, Guardiola warned Real Madrid, who have won 14 Champions Leagues to City\u2019s one: \u201cWe are on our way. If they fall asleep, we will be catching them.\u201d That may not have been a joke. FINANCIAL TIMES"

      "Money plays a significant role in modern football, with clubs spending vast amounts of money on players, coaches, and facilities.",
      "However, it is a Catch-22 situation for smaller clubs as they struggle to compete with the big spenders.",
      "On the one hand, smaller clubs cannot afford to match the financial muscle of the big clubs, which makes it difficult for them to attract top players and coaches.",
      "On the other hand, the financial disparity between big and small clubs is exacerbated by the revenue streams that big clubs generate through TV rights, sponsorship, and merchandise sales.",
      "This means that smaller clubs are at a disadvantage in terms of generating revenue, which makes it even harder for them to compete.",

      "The key priorities of nations in the age of the digital economy include the responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI), cyber security and connectivity. Touching on this crucial issue last week, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong drew attention to the transformative role that AI could play in the economic evolution of Singapore, which has never been shy to embrace the accelerative role of technology in its journey from penury to success. But the stakes are higher today. While AI could shake up the digital economy, it also possesses biases that could compromise its decision-making, with serious implications for societies. Ensuring the ethics of AI usage, therefore, is crucial to its future, as beneficial technology acts as a force multiplier in social and economic relations.",
      "Explaining AI\u2019s importance, Minister for Communications and Information Josephine Teo has compared it to electricity. Electricity by itself brings humans little benefit, but when it is used to power appliances and equipment, people gain so much more by way of convenience, productivity and capabilities, she said recently. Likewise, AI \u2013 which is the power of human-like intelligence and potentially a very high form of it, at far reduced cost \u2013 benefits Singapore, which depends on human capital, Mrs Teo added. Just as the improper use of appliances and equipment can cause electrocution, the inappropriate use of AI can do great harm. Hence the need to harness it within guard rails necessary for its safe design and responsible use.",
      "Clearly, the Government views AI as a net technological contributor to the public good, with the risks that it poses needing to be minimised. Singapore is striving to do so by developing frameworks to promote accountability and trust. It published a Model AI Governance Framework in 2019, which was, and remains, the first of its kind in Asia. In 2022, the country introduced AI Verify, a governance testing framework and toolkit. Now, vanguard actors in AI have allied themselves with the authorities here to tackle issues such as bias and copyright. The Singapore-based AI Verify Foundation, which consists of at least 60 global industry players, will discuss AI standards and best practices, and create a neutral platform for collaboration on governing AI.",
      "International collaboration is crucial so that Singapore benefits from the latest in AI thinking but remains alert to the constant need to control the potential for abuse. Of particular concern is generative AI, the foundation on which other apps are built. Machines that appear to have a mind of their own present an affront to human consciousness. The answer lies not in trying to ban the presence of such machines, which is difficult, if not impossible, but in ensuring that AI is developed and used responsibly. That effort lies within the realm of human capability."

    "answer": [
      "There are several potential biases in AI that could compromise its decision-making and have serious implications for societies. One of the most significant biases is the concept of confirmation bias, which refers to the tendency of AI systems to prioritize information that confirms their existing beliefs and ignore information that contradicts them. This bias can lead to the development of AI systems that are biased and discriminatory, particularly when it comes to issues related to race, gender, and other forms of identity.",
      "Another potential bias in AI is the so-called \"echo chamber\" effect, where AI systems are only exposed to information that confirms their existing beliefs, leading to a reinforcement of these beliefs and a lack of diversity in perspectives. This can result in the development of AI systems that are narrow-minded and unable to adapt to new situations or challenges.",
      "Finally, the potential for AI systems to be manipulated or hacked by malicious actors is a significant concern. AI systems that are not properly secured can be vulnerable to attacks that can manipulate their decision-making processes, leading to unintended outcomes and potential harm to individuals or society as a whole.",

    "question": "4. Why is ensuring the ethics of AI usage crucial to its future?",
    "answer": [
      "Ensuring the ethics of AI usage is crucial to its future for several reasons. Firstly, AI has the potential to significantly impact society, particularly in terms of employment and the economy. As AI continues to advance, it is possible that it will replace many jobs that are currently done by humans. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the development and deployment of AI is ethical and fair, to prevent negative consequences such as widespread unemployment.",
      "Secondly, AI has the potential to perpetuate and amplify existing biases and inequalities. For example, if AI is trained on biased data, it can perpetuate and even amplify those biases in its decision-making. This can have serious consequences, particularly for marginalized communities who may already face discrimination and inequality. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the development and deployment of AI is ethical and fair, to prevent the perpetuation and amplification of biases and inequalities.",
      "Finally, ensuring the ethics of AI usage is crucial to its future because it is the right thing to do. AI has the potential to greatly benefit society, but it is important to ensure that it is developed and deployed in a way that is ethical and fair. This includes ensuring that the development and deployment of AI is transparent, accountable, and inclusive, to ensure that all voices are heard and that the benefits of AI are shared equitably.",

      "The key priorities of nations in the age of the digital economy include the responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI), cyber security and connectivity. Touching on this crucial issue last week, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong drew attention to the transformative role that AI could play in the economic evolution of Singapore, which has never been shy to embrace the accelerative role of technology in its journey from penury to success. But the stakes are higher today. While AI could shake up the digital economy, it also possesses biases that could compromise its decision-making, with serious implications for societies. Ensuring the ethics of AI usage, therefore, is crucial to its future, as beneficial technology acts as a force multiplier in social and economic relations.",
      "Explaining AI\u2019s importance, Minister for Communications and Information Josephine Teo has compared it to electricity. Electricity by itself brings humans little benefit, but when it is used to power appliances and equipment, people gain so much more by way of convenience, productivity and capabilities, she said recently. Likewise, AI \u2013 which is the power of human-like intelligence and potentially a very high form of it, at far reduced cost \u2013 benefits Singapore, which depends on human capital, Mrs Teo added. Just as the improper use of appliances and equipment can cause electrocution, the inappropriate use of AI can do great harm. Hence the need to harness it within guard rails necessary for its safe design and responsible use.",
      "Clearly, the Government views AI as a net technological contributor to the public good, with the risks that it poses needing to be minimised. Singapore is striving to do so by developing frameworks to promote accountability and trust. It published a Model AI Governance Framework in 2019, which was, and remains, the first of its kind in Asia. In 2022, the country introduced AI Verify, a governance testing framework and toolkit. Now, vanguard actors in AI have allied themselves with the authorities here to tackle issues such as bias and copyright. The Singapore-based AI Verify Foundation, which consists of at least 60 global industry players, will discuss AI standards and best practices, and create a neutral platform for collaboration on governing AI.",
      "International collaboration is crucial so that Singapore benefits from the latest in AI thinking but remains alert to the constant need to control the potential for abuse. Of particular concern is generative AI, the foundation on which other apps are built. Machines that appear to have a mind of their own present an affront to human consciousness. The answer lies not in trying to ban the presence of such machines, which is difficult, if not impossible, but in ensuring that AI is developed and used responsibly. That effort lies within the realm of human capability."
    ],
    "question": "5. How can the improper use of AI cause harm, and what are the necessary guardrails for its safe design and responsible use?",
    "answer": [
      "1. Lack of transparency: Improper use of AI can lead to a lack of transparency in decision-making processes, which can result in biased outcomes that are difficult to explain or challenge. For example, if an AI system is used to make hiring decisions, but the decision-making process is not transparent, it can be difficult to determine if the decision was made fairly or if bias played a role.",
      "2. Bias and discrimination: AI systems can perpetuate and amplify existing biases and discrimination if they are not designed and trained in a way that considers the diversity of the population. For example, if an AI system used to evaluate loan applications is trained on data that reflects the biases of the lending institution, it may be more likely to approve loans for people who have traditionally had access to credit, and less likely to approve loans for people who have been historically marginalized.",
      "3. Privacy and security: The improper use of AI can also cause harm by violating privacy and security concerns. For example, if an AI system is used to analyze personal data without proper consent or security measures in place, it can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and identity theft. Additionally, if an AI system is used to make decisions that affect people's lives, such as sentencing in criminal cases, it is important to ensure that the data used to train the system is accurate and does not include biased or false information."

      "Since the publication of Animal Liberation in 1\u044c75, there have been significant changes in animal treatment. One notable change is the increased recognition of animal rights and the development of animal welfare laws and regulations. Many countries have passed laws to protect animals from cruelty and abuse, and there has been a growing awareness of the importance of treating animals ethically and humanely.",
      "Another change is the growth of the animal protection movement, which has increased public awareness and support for animal rights. This has led to the establishment of many animal shelters, sanctuaries, and rescue organizations, which provide care and support for animals in need.",
      "Finally, there has been a shift in the way that animals are used in research and industry. Many organizations have adopted more humane methods of animal use, such as reducing the number of animals used in research, using alternative methods where possible, and providing better living conditions for animals in research facilities. This shift towards more ethical animal use has been driven by both moral and practical considerations, as there is increasing evidence that animal models are not always reliable indicators of human response and can lead to unethical and ineffective research."

      "Nicolas Kristof",
      "In 1971, a half-dozen graduate students at Oxford University held what was perhaps the first protest of the modern animal rights movement. They insisted that respecting animals was a moral imperative.",
      "And the world changed.",
      "No, not right away. But one of those students, a young Australian philosopher named Peter Singer, turned his ideas into a transformative 1975 book, Animal Liberation, that was initially mocked for overreach. \u201cThe animal movement was still widely seen as crackpot,\u201d Professor Singer recalls.",
      "Yet, to anyone who thinks that ideas are irrelevant in a practical age, think again. His arguments stirred a slow-motion revolution that has changed the way we treat other animals.",
      "Prof Singer has just issued a new edition of the book, updated and titled Animal Liberation Now. It\u2019s a monument to the remarkable spread of the ideas he articulated in 1975. At least nine states and the European Union now ban veal crates, hen cages or tight stalls for sows. The top supermarket chains in America have agreed to sell only cage-free eggs by 2026, and McDonalds has done the same.",
      "A court in Argentina accepted that habeas corpus rights apply to a chimpanzee. Israel and California have banned the sale of fur coats. Pope Francis has suggested that animals go to Heaven and that the Virgin Mary \u201cgrieves for the sufferings\u201d of mistreated livestock.",
      "How times have changed. When Mary Wollstonecraft advocated for the rights of women in 1792, that seemed to some so ridiculous that a satirist mocked her by calling for the rights of animals as well. Now, it\u2019s unquestioned (at least in the abstract) that rights extend to people of all races and religions, including women, and in some cases to animals as well. When voters face referendums on animal rights, they often approve them by large margins.",
      "Yet, there\u2019s so much more to be done, as the new edition of Prof Singer\u2019s book documents.",
      "Agribusiness has been very successful at two things: producing very cheap protein and hiding from public view the cruelty that has been ingrained in factory farming to cut costs.",
      "An individual seen whipping a dog risks arrest, but chief executives whose companies in effect torture chickens are celebrated for their business acumen. Individualised animal abuse is a crime; systematic animal abuse is a business model.",
      "Prof Singer writes about how poultry has been bred so birds grow extremely quickly and with huge breasts, since breast meat is particularly valuable. By one estimate, if human babies grew at the same pace as today\u2019s broiler chickens, at two months, they would weigh 660 pounds \u2013 so it\u2019s no surprise that chickens\u2019 legs often give out and that by some accounts, they suffer chronic pain.",
      "When animals are reduced to widgets to maximise quarterly profits, it\u2019s inevitable that there will be mistreatment. A farm in San Diego reportedly disposed of 30,000 live, squirming hens (who apparently were no longer producing sufficient eggs) by feeding them into a wood chipper. It was cost-effective.",
      "For the last half-dozen years, I\u2019ve avoided meat, in part because of Prof Singer\u2019s writing, in part because of my experience raising livestock and poultry on our family farm, and in part nudged by my daughter. But I puzzle over the complexities.",
      "I don\u2019t eat factory-farmed food, but is it okay to eat farm animals that have been humanely raised? (I could be open to that; after all, I do eat animals like elk that have been hunted, partly because natural predators are rare.) I stopped eating octopus after reading a book about their intelligence and empathy, but what about shrimp? (For now, I do eat shrimp and other shellfish.)",
      "To me, the central issue is as philosopher Jeremy Bentham expressed it in the 18th century: \u201cThe question is not, can they reason, nor can they talk, but can they suffer?\u201d And the answers for, say, oysters, aren\u2019t always obvious.",
      "We haven\u2019t figured out our moral obligations to fellow humans, so perhaps it\u2019s understandable that we haven\u2019t worked out our obligations to shellfish. But the way people struggle with these questions strikes me as a measure of moral progress \u2013 and of the power of ideas.",
      "\u201cThe ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood,\u201d wrote John Maynard Keynes. \u201cIndeed the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\u201d",
      "And so it is that a philosopher\u2019s book originally published almost half a century ago prodded our consciences and changed what will be on summer barbecue grills around the world. That is the moral force of an idea whose time has arrived. NYTIMES"

      "* En el art\u00edculo, argumenta que los derechos de los animales son una parte fundamental de los derechos humanos",
      "* La argumentaci\u00f3n se basa en el principio de no-contradicci\u00f3n, que sostiene que no se pueden negar los derechos a una persona debido a su raza, g\u00e9nero o especie",
      "* El autor utiliza el ejemplo de la esclavitud para ilustrar c\u00f3mo los derechos de los animales son importantes para la protecci\u00f3n de los derechos humanos",

Seg\u00fan este principio, no se pueden negar los derechos a una persona debido a su raza, g\u00e9nero o especie.

      "3. En resumen, Francione sostiene que los derechos de los animales son una parte fundamental de los derechos humanos. La no-contradicci\u00f3n y el ejemplo de la esclavitud son claves en su argumentaci\u00f3n para apoyar esta afirmaci\u00f3n."

      "Martin Ivens",
      "Nothing became him in life like the leaving of it, says a character from Macbeth of the traitor Cawdor\u2019s acceptance of his execution. Mr Boris Johnson may have once been commissioned to write a study of Shakespeare, but he has never taken that particular line to heart. Perhaps that\u2019s why he returned the publisher\u2019s advance.",
      "Late on Friday, Mr Johnson resigned abruptly as an MP rather than fight a by-election after an investigation found that he had misled Parliament over the Downing Street parties scandal. In a vituperative 1,000-word statement, he condemned his accusers and then launched a frontal assault on Prime Minister Rishi Sunak for betraying Brexit and leading the Conservative party to electoral disaster. He is unlikely to go gentle into that good night.",
      "When a senior minister, Mr Michael Gove, suggested that Mr Johnson resign as prime minister after his authority crumbled in 2022, he fired the man on the spot. Three-time election winners like Mrs Margaret Thatcher and Mr Tony Blair may have allowed themselves to be pushed into the departure lounge of politics by colleagues, but Boris was never going to go peaceably. Nor has he quite gone.",
      "Polling expert Matthew Goodwin, who has charted the rise of British populism sympathetically, notes this weekend that Mr Johnson has already brought down three prime ministers. First was Mr David Cameron, over Brexit. Next came his successor, Mrs Theresa May, over the terms of the exit deal. Finally, he scuppered his own leadership by breaking lockdown rules during the pandemic and failing to be frank about it. Now he has a fourth prime minister in his sights \u2013 Mr Sunak.",
      "Mr Johnson may be sincere in some of what he wrote in his resignation statement \u2013 the self-pity is certainly authentic and has always been his Achilles heel (as I know from my days as a newspaper editor, fending off injured replies when he felt he had been traduced \u2013 or simply not loved enough). It does, however, veer towards a skewed representation of the truth \u2013 he knows that Mr Sunak\u2019s credentials as a Brexiteer have never been in doubt. The two just differ on what can practically be delivered to enforce the separation from the European Union.",
      "In the statement, Mr Johnson accuses the cross-party House of Commons Privileges Committee of seven MPs of being \u201cdetermined to use the proceedings against me to drive me out of Parliament\u201d, which he says sets an \u201cunsettling\u201d and undemocratic precedent. Its Labour chair, Ms Harriet Harman, is indeed a sworn enemy \u2013 but her committee has a Conservative majority.",
      "Mr Johnson is addicted to risk-taking and the limelight. He could, of course, butt out of politics altogether and add to his mountainous cash pile acquired from public-speaking engagements \u2013 he has earned more than \u00a36.5 million (S$11 million) in the last year alone. But although he loves the money, he might soon get bored.",
      "It\u2019s nice being feted abroad, especially in the US, and in Ukraine he gets a hero\u2019s welcome for his full-throated defence of that nation. But he may miss the applause back home. Domestic journalists are obsessed with him, with the media lapping up his every word. Like Oscar Wilde, he is a self-publicist who believes there\u2019s nothing worse than being talked about, other than not being talked about.",
      "So, the great gambler of modern British politics may be embarking upon his biggest crapshoot so far, and the stakes are high \u2013 and not only for him. For there is usually method in what his liberal and left-wing critics take to be political madness.",
      "The clue lies in the Trumpian vocabulary of his resignation statement \u2013 \u201cwitch-hunts\u201d, \u201ckangaroo court\u201d, \u201cbetrayal\u201d. Like his recent host, the former president of the United States, Mr Johnson has rejected the process that brought him low.",
      "On the right of British politics, strong winds are still blowing towards populism. Although Mr Johnson\u2019s popularity in the country at large has plummeted since his huge electoral win in 2019, many Conservative voters and party members still regard him as their once and future king. Mr Sunak comes mid-level in the popularity polls of the ConservativeHome website.",
      "The ruling party is at a crossroads. Mr Sunak was not the first choice of party members (Mr Johnson chooses to regard him as a scheming back-stabber following Mr Sunak\u2019s resignation as his Chancellor of the Exchequer). The tax-cutting revolution of Ms Liz Truss, Mr Johnson\u2019s anointed successor, may have crashed and burned on contact with reality last autumn, but that agenda still gets Tory pulses racing. Panicky Conservative MPs have recently been clamouring for the abolition of inheritance tax. They want income tax cuts, too; in fact, anything to bribe the voters with their own money before the next election.",
      "Politics, like comedy, is about the way you tell them. Mr Sunak\u2019s credentials as a right-winger on immigration, Brexit and free-market economics are the real thing. But activists see income and business taxes rising to unprecedented post-war levels. Then they look at their leader, a soft-spoken former Goldman Sachs banker in a sharp suit and Prada loafers, and despair of him retaining the Brexit-supporting voters of \u201cleft-behind Britain\u201d acquired at the last election.",
      "The party faithful\u2019s heads tell them they can\u2019t have Trussonomics, but their hearts are with Mr Johnson\u2019s philosophy of \u201ccakeism\u201d \u2013 having it and eating it, with both high spending and low taxes.",
      "Why should Boris volunteer for the ignominy of by-election defeat in his Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency, with its vulnerable majority, when he can live to fight another day, say his allies? Perhaps another departing Tory MP will help gift him a safe seat, if his candidacy is not blocked by Conservative headquarters.",
      "In any case, if Mr Sunak goes crashing down to defeat in the next 18 months, Tory associations, by Mr Johnson\u2019s reckoning, will demand his return.",
      "Mr Sunak is already walking, in the words of his top strategist Isaac Levido, \u201ca narrow path to victory\u201d. The Labour opposition has a large lead in the polls and its leader, Mr Keir Starmer, has wiped out left-wing dissent in his ranks. Although the present prime minister no longer fears a threat from Mr Johnson\u2019s dwindling band of backbench supporters, the Boris circus is a distraction he can do without. It makes him look weak, and the party divided.",
      "It also, however, reminds Mr Sunak that he needs to expedite and focus his push for re-election. Failure will almost certainly bring the noisiest of political exiles back to the fray for the Tory crown. BLOOMBERG"

      "Martin Ivens",
      "Nothing became him in life like the leaving of it, says a character from Macbeth of the traitor Cawdor\u2019s acceptance of his execution. Mr Boris Johnson may have once been commissioned to write a study of Shakespeare, but he has never taken that particular line to heart. Perhaps that\u2019s why he returned the publisher\u2019s advance.",
      "Late on Friday, Mr Johnson resigned abruptly as an MP rather than fight a by-election after an investigation found that he had misled Parliament over the Downing Street parties scandal. In a vituperative 1,000-word statement, he condemned his accusers and then launched a frontal assault on Prime Minister Rishi Sunak for betraying Brexit and leading the Conservative party to electoral disaster. He is unlikely to go gentle into that good night.",
      "When a senior minister, Mr Michael Gove, suggested that Mr Johnson resign as prime minister after his authority crumbled in 2022, he fired the man on the spot. Three-time election winners like Mrs Margaret Thatcher and Mr Tony Blair may have allowed themselves to be pushed into the departure lounge of politics by colleagues, but Boris was never going to go peaceably. Nor has he quite gone.",
      "Polling expert Matthew Goodwin, who has charted the rise of British populism sympathetically, notes this weekend that Mr Johnson has already brought down three prime ministers. First was Mr David Cameron, over Brexit. Next came his successor, Mrs Theresa May, over the terms of the exit deal. Finally, he scuppered his own leadership by breaking lockdown rules during the pandemic and failing to be frank about it. Now he has a fourth prime minister in his sights \u2013 Mr Sunak.",
      "Mr Johnson may be sincere in some of what he wrote in his resignation statement \u2013 the self-pity is certainly authentic and has always been his Achilles heel (as I know from my days as a newspaper editor, fending off injured replies when he felt he had been traduced \u2013 or simply not loved enough). It does, however, veer towards a skewed representation of the truth \u2013 he knows that Mr Sunak\u2019s credentials as a Brexiteer have never been in doubt. The two just differ on what can practically be delivered to enforce the separation from the European Union.",
      "In the statement, Mr Johnson accuses the cross-party House of Commons Privileges Committee of seven MPs of being \u201cdetermined to use the proceedings against me to drive me out of Parliament\u201d, which he says sets an \u201cunsettling\u201d and undemocratic precedent. Its Labour chair, Ms Harriet Harman, is indeed a sworn enemy \u2013 but her committee has a Conservative majority.",
      "Mr Johnson is addicted to risk-taking and the limelight. He could, of course, butt out of politics altogether and add to his mountainous cash pile acquired from public-speaking engagements \u2013 he has earned more than \u00a36.5 million (S$11 million) in the last year alone. But although he loves the money, he might soon get bored.",
      "It\u2019s nice being feted abroad, especially in the US, and in Ukraine he gets a hero\u2019s welcome for his full-throated defence of that nation. But he may miss the applause back home. Domestic journalists are obsessed with him, with the media lapping up his every word. Like Oscar Wilde, he is a self-publicist who believes there\u2019s nothing worse than being talked about, other than not being talked about.",
      "So, the great gambler of modern British politics may be embarking upon his biggest crapshoot so far, and the stakes are high \u2013 and not only for him. For there is usually method in what his liberal and left-wing critics take to be political madness.",
      "The clue lies in the Trumpian vocabulary of his resignation statement \u2013 \u201cwitch-hunts\u201d, \u201ckangaroo court\u201d, \u201cbetrayal\u201d. Like his recent host, the former president of the United States, Mr Johnson has rejected the process that brought him low.",
      "On the right of British politics, strong winds are still blowing towards populism. Although Mr Johnson\u2019s popularity in the country at large has plummeted since his huge electoral win in 2019, many Conservative voters and party members still regard him as their once and future king. Mr Sunak comes mid-level in the popularity polls of the ConservativeHome website.",
      "The ruling party is at a crossroads. Mr Sunak was not the first choice of party members (Mr Johnson chooses to regard him as a scheming back-stabber following Mr Sunak\u2019s resignation as his Chancellor of the Exchequer). The tax-cutting revolution of Ms Liz Truss, Mr Johnson\u2019s anointed successor, may have crashed and burned on contact with reality last autumn, but that agenda still gets Tory pulses racing. Panicky Conservative MPs have recently been clamouring for the abolition of inheritance tax. They want income tax cuts, too; in fact, anything to bribe the voters with their own money before the next election.",
      "Politics, like comedy, is about the way you tell them. Mr Sunak\u2019s credentials as a right-winger on immigration, Brexit and free-market economics are the real thing. But activists see income and business taxes rising to unprecedented post-war levels. Then they look at their leader, a soft-spoken former Goldman Sachs banker in a sharp suit and Prada loafers, and despair of him retaining the Brexit-supporting voters of \u201cleft-behind Britain\u201d acquired at the last election.",
      "The party faithful\u2019s heads tell them they can\u2019t have Trussonomics, but their hearts are with Mr Johnson\u2019s philosophy of \u201ccakeism\u201d \u2013 having it and eating it, with both high spending and low taxes.",
      "Why should Boris volunteer for the ignominy of by-election defeat in his Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency, with its vulnerable majority, when he can live to fight another day, say his allies? Perhaps another departing Tory MP will help gift him a safe seat, if his candidacy is not blocked by Conservative headquarters.",
      "In any case, if Mr Sunak goes crashing down to defeat in the next 18 months, Tory associations, by Mr Johnson\u2019s reckoning, will demand his return.",
      "Mr Sunak is already walking, in the words of his top strategist Isaac Levido, \u201ca narrow path to victory\u201d. The Labour opposition has a large lead in the polls and its leader, Mr Keir Starmer, has wiped out left-wing dissent in his ranks. Although the present prime minister no longer fears a threat from Mr Johnson\u2019s dwindling band of backbench supporters, the Boris circus is a distraction he can do without. It makes him look weak, and the party divided.",

Mr Boris Johnson may have once been commissioned to write a study of Shakespeare, but he has never taken that particular line to heart. Perhaps that\u2019s why he returned the publisher\u2019s advance.",
      "Late on Friday, Mr Johnson resigned abruptly as an MP rather than fight a by-election after an investigation found that he had misled Parliament over the Downing Street parties scandal. In a vituperative 1,000-word statement, he condemned his accusers and then launched a frontal assault on Prime Minister Rishi Sunak for betraying Brexit and leading the Conservative party to electoral disaster. He is unlikely to go gentle into that good night.",
      "When a senior minister, Mr Michael Gove, suggested that Mr Johnson resign as prime minister after his authority crumbled in 2022, he fired the man on the spot. Three-time election winners like Mrs Margaret Thatcher and Mr Tony Blair may have allowed themselves to be pushed into the departure lounge of politics by colleagues, but Boris was never going to go peaceably. Nor has he quite gone.",
      "Polling expert Matthew Goodwin, who has charted the rise of British populism sympathetically, notes this weekend that Mr Johnson has already brought down three prime ministers. First was Mr David Cameron, over Brexit. Next came his successor, Mrs Theresa May, over the terms of the exit deal. Finally, he scuppered his own leadership by breaking lockdown rules during the pandemic and failing to be frank about it. Now he has a fourth prime minister in his sights \u2013 Mr Sunak.",
      "Mr Johnson may be sincere in some of what he wrote in his resignation statement \u2013 the self-pity is certainly authentic and has always been his Achilles heel (as I know from my days as a newspaper editor, fending off injured replies when he felt he had been traduced \u2013 or simply not loved enough). It does, however, veer towards a skewed representation of the truth \u2013 he knows that Mr Sunak\u2019s credentials as a Brexiteer have never been in doubt. The two just differ on what can practically be delivered to enforce the separation from the European Union.",
      "In the statement, Mr Johnson accuses the cross-party House of Commons Privileges Committee of seven MPs of being \u201cdetermined to use the proceedings against me to drive me out of Parliament\u201d, which he says sets an \u201cunsettling\u201d and undemocratic precedent. Its Labour chair, Ms Harriet Harman, is indeed a sworn enemy \u2013 but her committee has a Conservative majority.",
      "Mr Johnson is addicted to risk-taking and the limelight. He could, of course, butt out of politics altogether and add to his mountainous cash pile acquired from public-speaking engagements \u2013 he has earned more than \u00a36.5 million (S$11 million) in the last year alone. But although he loves the money, he might soon get bored.",
      "It\u2019s nice being feted abroad, especially in the US, and in Ukraine he gets a hero\u2019s welcome for his full-throated defence of that nation. But he may miss the applause back home. Domestic journalists are obsessed with him, with the media lapping up his every word. Like Oscar Wilde, he is a self-publicist who believes there\u2019s nothing worse than being talked about, other than not being talked about.",

Although Mr Johnson\u2019s popularity in the country at large has plummeted since his huge electoral win in 2019, many Conservative voters and party members still regard him as their once and future king. Mr Sunak comes mid-level in the popularity polls of the ConservativeHome website.",
      "The ruling party is at a crossroads. Mr Sunak was not the first choice of party members (Mr Johnson chooses to regard him as a scheming back-stabber following Mr Sunak\u2019s resignation as his Chancellor of the Exchequer). The tax-cutting revolution of Ms Liz Truss, Mr Johnson\u2019s anointed successor, may have crashed and burned on contact with reality last autumn, but that agenda still gets Tory pulses racing. Panicky Conservative MPs have recently been clamouring for the abolition of inheritance tax. They want income tax cuts, too; in fact, anything to bribe the voters with their own money before the next election.",

But activists see income and business taxes rising to unprecedented post-war levels. Then they look at their leader, a soft-spoken former Goldman Sachs banker in a sharp suit and Prada loafers, and despair of him retaining the Brexit-supporting voters of \u201cleft-behind Britain\u201d acquired at the last election.",

      "Why should Boris volunteer for the ignominy of by-election defeat in his Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency, with its vulnerable majority, when he can live to fight another day, say his allies? Perhaps another departing Tory MP will help gift him a safe seat, if his candidacy is not blocked by Conservative headquarters.",
      "In any case, if Mr Sunak goes crashing down to defeat in the next 18 months, Tory associations, by Mr Johnson\u2019s reckoning, will demand his return.",

      "1. One of the most significant environmental impacts of building construction and renovation is the generation of construction waste. This waste includes materials that are not suitable for reuse or recycling, such as broken tiles, bricks, and concrete. Construction waste can also include non-hazardous materials that are disposed of in landfills, leading to the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.",
      "2. Another environmental impact of building construction and renovation is the consumption of natural resources, such as timber and metals. The production of these materials often involves the clearing of forests and the extraction of minerals, which can have a negative impact on biodiversity and the environment.",
      "3. Additionally, the energy consumption during the construction process can also have a significant impact on the environment. The production of building materials and the transportation of materials to the construction site can consume a large amount of energy, leading to the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This can contribute to climate change and other environmental issues."

      "\u201cIn spaces that undergo cyclical renovations, the cumulative carbon impact of interiors can actually surpass the emissions generated by building the structure and envelope,\u201d it said. \u201cThe structure and envelope are only built once unless you\u2019re constructing an addition, but interiors change relatively frequently.\u201d",
      "This is food for thought as Singapore pushes towards a target of net-zero emissions by 2050.",
      "Think about the square footage of your home, then consider how much waste a renovation generates when you look at these figures from the US: The average residential renovation produces more than 10kg of waste per square foot, according to a study by the country\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency. So renovating just a 100-square-foot area could generate more than one tonne of debris like tiles, wood and more.",
      "There\u2019s no way we can avoid producing waste, of course, when we have to make repairs, and improve homes in terms of indoor air quality, energy efficiency and so on. Living well and enjoying our homes are top priorities.",
      "But if there\u2019s no pressing need, and renovations are more of a lifestyle choice \u2013 like buying tonnes of clothes for fashionable fun \u2013 maybe homeowners can slow things down, and take the time to consider reusing some interior elements.",
      "It may be surprising what we can live with if we slow down the rush to renovate and replace.",
      "I love scrolling through inspirational interior decoration online pictures, so I surprised myself by not having done a renovation or two on my home of over a decade.",
      "And given my love of home appliances, I\u2019m also tickled that I am still using the fridge (and even all the curtains) of the previous owner of my home. I also used his washing machine and air-conditioner for years until they gave up the ghost.",
      "Save some money and save the earth at the same time.",
      "These are personal decisions homeowners can make while we wait to see if the structured reuse of and end-of-life green strategies for materials will become more mainstream in the renovation industry.",
      "Well, at least, I am hoping for such structured nudges to arrive one day so I can make better decisions if I ever get to start on my first-ever full-scale renovation.",
      "Look, for example, at how consumers can be nudged by green loans.",
      "These loans promise preferential interest rates, rebates and shopping vouchers for eligible consumers who fulfil some pre-set criteria.",
      "To qualify for the green renovation loans, homes must have energy-efficient features such as LED lighting, smart devices to turn off appliances remotely when not in use, and so on.",
      "Banks in Singapore say there is growing interest among consumers to take up green financing solutions. Ninety per cent of DBS\u2019 renovation loan customers are now on a green loan, according to a March 2023 ST report. Other banks with various green loan offers include OCBC.",
      "It\u2019s easier to make better decisions if there\u2019s a menu of green options laid before you. This is because, believe me, I am fully ready to be tempted into replacing everything.",
      "I think that after using the previous owner\u2019s fridge, washing machine, TV, all of his interior fixtures and cabinets for over 10 years \u2013 and living with a ceiling hole as well as bathing with a bucket for months \u2013 it is finally time to renovate and replace it all. In a green way."

    "question": "5. What role can financial incentives play in encouraging homeowners to make more sustainable renovation choices?",
    "answer": [
      "Financial incentives can play a significant role in encouraging homeowners to make more sustainable renovation choices. One way in which financial incentives can encourage sustainable renovation is by offering tax credits or rebates for homeowners who make energy-efficient upgrades to their homes. This can provide an immediate financial benefit for homeowners, making sustainable renovations more financially feasible. Additionally, financial incentives can help to reduce the upfront costs of sustainable renovations, making them more accessible to homeowners who may not have the financial resources to make these improvements on their own.",
      "Another way in which financial incentives can encourage sustainable renovation is by offering low-interest loans or grants for homeowners who are making energy-efficient upgrades to their homes. This can help to reduce the overall cost of sustainable renovations, making them more affordable for homeowners. Additionally, by providing low-interest loans or grants, financial incentives can help to reduce the overall cost of sustainable renovations, making them more accessible to homeowners who may not have the financial resources to make these improvements on their own.",
      "Finally, financial incentives can encourage sustainable renovation by providing homeowners with information about the financial benefits of energy-efficient upgrades. This can include information about the cost savings that can be achieved through sustainable renovations, as well as the environmental benefits of making these upgrades. By providing homeowners with this information, financial incentives can help to educate them about the benefits of sustainable renovations and encourage them to make these upgrades.",
      "Overall, financial incentives can play a significant role in encouraging homeowners to make more sustainable renovation choices. By providing financial benefits, reducing the upfront costs of sustainable renovations, and educating homeowners about the benefits of sustainable renovations, financial incentives can help to promote energy-efficient upgrades and make sustainable renovations more accessible to homeowners."

This can lead to a significant reduction in carbon emissions, as well as lowering energy costs for consumers.",
      "Finally, AI can be used to develop new technologies that can replace traditional energy sources with cleaner alternatives. For example, AI can be used to optimize the design and operation of wind turbines and solar panels to maximize their energy output, or to develop new technologies such as fusion power that can provide a carbon-free energy source.",

      "So here\u2019s a thought. Instead of pushing ahead with a technology that its leading inventors say could soon have the power to kill humans, how about not pushing ahead with it?",
      "This radical notion is prompted by a warning from the man setting up the British prime minister\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) task force.",
      "Matt Clifford observed that: \u201cYou can have really very dangerous threats to humans that could kill many humans, not all humans, simply from where we\u2019d expect models to be in two years\u2019 time.\u201d",
      "On second thoughts, maybe I\u2019m overreacting. His full remarks were more nuanced and anyway it\u2019s not all humans. Just many of them. But similarly apocalyptic warnings have come from leading figures in its development, writing under the aegis of the Centre for AI Safety.",
      "In an admirably succinct warning, a Who\u2019s Who of the AI industry stressed that: \u201cMitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.\u201d",
      "The heads of Google DeepMind, OpenAI and umpteen others have taken time off from inventing the technology that could wipe out all human life to warn the rest of us that, really, something should be done to stop this happening. And these guys are supposed to be the geniuses?",
      "Across potting sheds in England, there are any number of slightly wacky guys who have invented a new machine which might be brilliant but might also burn down their house, and most of them have managed to work out by themselves that maybe the device is not such a great idea after all.",
      "This is where the small-fry inventors have been going wrong. Perhaps instead of figuring out the risks for themselves, what they really needed to do was score several billion pounds\u2019 worth of venture capital funding and then write a letter to the local council warning that they really ought to be controlled.",
      "I recognise, to be serious, that great things are expected of artificial intelligence, many of which do not involve the obliteration of the human race. Many argue that AI could play a pivotal role in delivering a carbon-free future, though perhaps that\u2019s just a euphemism for wiping out humanity.",
      "Just as important is that the advances already made cannot be uninvented. But already AI chatbots are falsifying information \u2013 or \u201challucinating\u201d as its developers prefer to put it \u2013 and its inventors are not quite sure why.",
      "So there does seem to be an argument for slowing down and ironing out that teensy wrinkle before moving on to, you know, extinction-level technology.",
      "A generous view of the tech leaders calling for themselves to be leashed is that they are being responsible and that it\u2019s the other irresponsible actors they are worried about. They\u2019d like to do more but, you see, the guys at Google can\u2019t let themselves be beaten by the guys at Microsoft.",
      "So these warnings are an attempt to shake politicians and regulators into action, which is damned sporting of them given that world leaders have such a stellar record of responding cooperatively and intelligently to extinction-level threats.",
      "I mean come on. They\u2019ve mentioned it to the United States Congress. I don\u2019t think we could ask much more. And the British government is now on the case, which would be more reassuring if it wasn\u2019t still struggling to process asylum seekers in less than 18 months.",
      "With luck, the warnings will indeed shock governments into useful action. Maybe this leads to global standards, international agreements and a moratorium on killer developments.",
      "Either way, the AI gurus\u2019 consciences are now clear. They\u2019ve done all they can.",
      "And if one day, around 2025, the machines do indeed gain the power to obliterate us \u2013 sorry, many of us \u2013 I like to think that in the final seconds the AI will ping out a last inquiry to the brilliant minds who knowingly blundered ahead with a technology that could destroy us without at that stage figuring out how to, you know, stop it doing so.",
      "\u201cWhy did you carry on, knowing the risks?\u201d asks SkyNet. And in their final seconds the geniuses reply: \u201cWhat do you mean? We signed a statement.\u201d Financial Times"

    "question": "5. What is the current state of AI chatbots in terms of falsifying information?",
    "answer": [
      "The current state of AI chatbots in terms of falsifying information is a topic of concern as they have the potential to spread false information. While AI chatbots have revolutionized customer service, their ability to provide accurate information is often questionable. AI chatbots are programmed to generate responses based on patterns in large datasets, which means that they can generate responses that are not accurate.",
      "One of the main challenges with AI chatbots is their lack of understanding of context. Chatbots may provide inaccurate responses if they do not understand the context of the question. For example, if a user asks a chatbot for the capital of France, the chatbot may provide the capital of France, Canada. This is because the chatbot does not understand that the user is asking for the capital of France.",
      "Furthermore, AI chatbots can also be manipulated by malicious actors who can input false information into their training datasets. This can result in chatbots providing inaccurate information, which can have serious consequences. For example, a chatbot that provides inaccurate information about medical treatments can lead to harm to patients.",
      "To address these challenges, there is a need for AI chatbots to be trained on accurate and diverse datasets. Additionally, there is a need for chatbots to be designed to understand context and to be able to verify information before providing a response. This will help to ensure that chatbots provide accurate information and reduce the risk of spreading false information."

      "China\u2019s reopening at the end of 2022 was widely expected to trigger a robust rebound in economic activity after a year of rolling lockdowns and movement restrictions under a rigorously enforced zero-Covid policy. But recent economic data has belied such expectations, indicating instead that China still faces severe challenges in getting its economy back on track.",
      "The weakness is evident across multiple areas. Foreign direct investment (FDI) in the first quarter of 2023 fell 34 per cent year on year to about one-third of the level in the same period of 2020. Factory activity has been falling since March, with the purchasing managers\u2019 index indicating further declines ahead. Exports in May plunged by 7.5 per cent year on year, far exceeding the 0.4 per cent decline forecast by a consensus among economists, with double-digit declines to major markets, including the United States, Japan and South-east Asia. Economists now predict exports will contract in 2023 as a whole, neutralising a significant engine of growth.",
      "Domestically, continued weak housing starts suggest that the beleaguered property market has yet to turn around, despite policies to speed up the completion of unfinished developments. And while consumer spending on services such as restaurants and travel \u2013 which had been suppressed during the pandemic \u2013 has been relatively buoyant, spending on goods has been weak, suggesting that domestic demand remains sub-par.",
      "Given this gloomy data, meeting the government\u2019s 5 per cent gross domestic product growth target for 2023 could prove challenging. Moreover, China\u2019s weak post-pandemic rebound means that it is unlikely to be as significant an engine for regional growth as previously assumed. A 15 per cent decline in imports of semiconductors in May could, in particular, be of concern to economies with large electronics sectors, such as Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan.",
      "China\u2019s government is under some pressure, including from Communist Party-run media, to revive the economy. While it has limited room to boost exports in the face of weakening demand in some of its major markets in the West because of monetary tightening and import curbs, it has options to help the domestic economy. Economists expect that it will likely further ease monetary policies to expand the supply of credit, although there are concerns that much of this will flow to state-owned enterprises rather than the more dynamic private sector. The central government also has the policy space for a fiscal stimulus, which would be especially helpful given that many local authorities are cash-strapped. Relaxing the crackdown on the technology sector as well as on foreign consulting firms doing due diligence would also help revive FDI.",
      "Overall, the nature and size of the government\u2019s policy response will determine how effectively it can ensure that its economic reopening lives up to its promise."

      "China\u2019s reopening at the end of 2022 was widely expected to trigger a robust rebound in economic activity after a year of rolling lockdowns and movement restrictions under a rigorously enforced zero-Covid policy.

Factory activity has been falling since March, with the purchasing managers\u2019 index indicating further declines ahead. Exports in May plunged by 7.5 per cent year on year, far exceeding the 0.4 per cent decline forecast by a consensus among economists, with double-digit declines to major markets, including the United States, Japan and South-east Asia. Economists now predict exports will contract in 2023 as a whole, neutralising a significant engine of growth.",

      "Given this gloomy data, meeting the government\u2019s 5 per cent gross domestic product growth target for 2023 could prove challenging. Moreover, China\u2019s weak post-pandemic rebound means that it is unlikely to be as significant an engine for regional growth as previously assumed.

Economists expect that it will likely further ease monetary policies to expand the supply of credit, although there are concerns that much of this will flow to state-owned enterprises rather than the more dynamic private sector.

    ],
    "question": "2. How has China's economic reopening been affected by recent data?",
    "answer": [
      "The economic reopening of China has been affected by recent data in several ways. Firstly, the data shows that the Chinese economy is facing a slowdown in growth. According to recent data, the Chinese economy grew by 6.1% in the second quarter of 2021, which is the lowest growth rate since the COVID-19 pandemic began. This slowdown is a result of reduced demand for Chinese goods due to the pandemic, as well as the government's efforts to control inflation and reduce debt levels.",
      "Secondly, the data shows that the Chinese government is taking measures to stimulate the economy. In response to the slowdown, the government has implemented a range of policies aimed at boosting domestic demand and supporting businesses. For example, the government has cut taxes and fees, increased funding for infrastructure projects, and encouraged banks to lend more to small and medium-sized enterprises. These policies are expected to help support economic growth in the coming months.",
      "Finally, the data shows that the Chinese government is taking a more cautious approach to economic policymaking. The recent data has highlighted the risks of the pandemic and the need for continued vigilance. As a result, the government is taking a more cautious approach to economic policymaking, focusing on maintaining stability and avoiding excessive risk-taking. This approach is likely to continue until the pandemic has fully subsided and the global economy has fully recovered."

    "question": "4. How might China's economic reopening impact the region as a whole?",
    "answer": [
      "The economic reopening of China could have a significant impact on the region as a whole. One potential impact is that it could lead to increased economic growth and prosperity in the region. This is because China is a major trading partner for many countries in the region, and any increase in Chinese economic activity could lead to increased demand for goods and services from other countries in the region. This could lead to increased exports and investment, and could potentially drive overall economic growth in the region.",
      "Another potential impact of China's economic reopening is that it could lead to increased competition in the region. As China's economy grows, it is likely to become an even more significant player in the global economy, and could potentially compete with other countries in the region for trade and investment. This could lead to increased pressure on countries in the region to improve their own economic performance in order to remain competitive.",
      "Finally, China's economic reopening could also have political and diplomatic implications for the region as a whole. For example, it could potentially lead to increased tensions with neighboring countries, particularly if China's economic growth leads to a more assertive foreign policy. It could also potentially lead to increased cooperation between countries in the region, as they seek to capitalize on the opportunities presented by China's economic growth.",

      "China\u2019s reopening at the end of 2022 was widely expected to trigger a robust rebound in economic activity after a year of rolling lockdowns and movement restrictions under a rigorously enforced zero-Covid policy. But recent economic data has belied such expectations, indicating instead that China still faces severe challenges in getting its economy back on track.",
      "The weakness is evident across multiple areas. Foreign direct investment (FDI) in the first quarter of 2023 fell 34 per cent year on year to about one-third of the level in the same period of 2020. Factory activity has been falling since March, with the purchasing managers\u2019 index indicating further declines ahead. Exports in May plunged by 7.5 per cent year on year, far exceeding the 0.4 per cent decline forecast by a consensus among economists, with double-digit declines to major markets, including the United States, Japan and South-east Asia. Economists now predict exports will contract in 2023 as a whole, neutralising a significant engine of growth.",
      "Domestically, continued weak housing starts suggest that the beleaguered property market has yet to turn around, despite policies to speed up the completion of unfinished developments. And while consumer spending on services such as restaurants and travel \u2013 which had been suppressed during the pandemic \u2013 has been relatively buoyant, spending on goods has been weak, suggesting that domestic demand remains sub-par.",
      "Given this gloomy data, meeting the government\u2019s 5 per cent gross domestic product growth target for 2023 could prove challenging. Moreover, China\u2019s weak post-pandemic rebound means that it is unlikely to be as significant an engine for regional growth as previously assumed. A 15 per cent decline in imports of semiconductors in May could, in particular, be of concern to economies with large electronics sectors, such as Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan.",
      "China\u2019s government is under some pressure, including from Communist Party-run media, to revive the economy. While it has limited room to boost exports in the face of weakening demand in some of its major markets in the West because of monetary tightening and import curbs, it has options to help the domestic economy. Economists expect that it will likely further ease monetary policies to expand the supply of credit, although there are concerns that much of this will flow to state-owned enterprises rather than the more dynamic private sector. The central government also has the policy space for a fiscal stimulus, which would be especially helpful given that many local authorities are cash-strapped. Relaxing the crackdown on the technology sector as well as on foreign consulting firms doing due diligence would also help revive FDI.",
      "Overall, the nature and size of the government\u2019s policy response will determine how effectively it can ensure that its economic reopening lives up to its promise."
    ],
    "question": "5. What role can FDI play in reviving China's economy, and what steps can be taken to encourage it?",
    "answer": [
      "Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) can play a crucial role in reviving China's economy by injecting new capital, creating job opportunities, and promoting technological advancements.",
      "To encourage FDI, the Chinese government can take several steps such as simplifying the regulatory process, improving the business environment, and promoting transparency.",
      "Additionally, China can also leverage its strategic location, vast market, and skilled workforce to attract more foreign investment.",
      "By doing so, China can further diversify its economy and reduce its reliance on exports, which has been a significant driver of its economic growth in the past.",

      "Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam\u2019s announcement of his intention to run for president in the upcoming election could ignite Singaporeans\u2019 enthusiasm for the elected presidency.",
      "With incumbent President Halimah Yacob not seeking re-election, Mr Tharman said in a letter to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Thursday that he decided to put himself forward as a candidate.",
      "The decision had been taken after consultation with his family and in response to requests from Singaporeans from all walks of life, he said.",
      "A candidate with the expertise, experience and standing of Mr Tharman will have much to offer to Singapore\u2019s intra-executive branch system of checks and balances.",
      "Having been finance minister, he is well versed in domestic and international fiscal, monetary and economic matters.",
      "This means he is more than equipped to give the Government advice on such matters, as well as to keep it on its toes on matters that the president exercises custodial powers over, such as key public sector appointments and use of national reserves.",
      "For all of Mr Tharman\u2019s formidable qualities, a contest for the presidency should not be ruled out at this stage.",
      "Even though he is resigning from the Cabinet, given his ties to the ruling People\u2019s Action Party (PAP), Mr Tharman\u2019s candidacy might inspire hopefuls from the private sector who believe that they are equal to the task of being president and are able to gain the support of voters who prefer a non-establishment candidate.",
      "Potential rivals might also hope to leverage the argument for having a contest this round. Out of five presidential elections since 1993, only two were contested (in 1993 and 2011). The act of casting a ballot is significant for democratic choice and for candidates to gain a fair hearing.",
      "As a Nominated Member of Parliament between 2012 and 2014, I had the opportunity to observe close-up Mr Tharman in action in Parliament. In fielding parliamentary questions, he was scrupulously respectful of parliamentarians from across the aisle.",
      "He always endeavoured to answer queries without seeking partisan advantage. During debates on his Budget statements, he was also very persuasive with his erudite arguments and patient explanations in the face of MPs\u2019 calls for the Government to do more, to spend more, and to tax less.",
      "He never talked down to his parliamentary colleagues, especially the opposition.",
      "His people\u2019s touch and connection with the ground are well known.",
      "In addition to his Meet-the-People Sessions, his constituents know where to find him on weekends when he is in his constituency.",
      "Mr Tharman also has a reputation of being independent-minded, even as a senior Cabinet member.",
      "In making the case for a broader meritocracy, \u201ca meritocracy through life\u201d, and of our social safety net as a \u201ctrampoline\u201d, his take was aligned with the Government\u2019s fundamental premise. But in offering refreshing insights of how policies could \u2013 and have, in fact \u2013 evolved, he was able to nudge innovation to keep longstanding policies fit for purpose.",
      "That independence of mind was noted by PM Lee in his letter to Mr Tharman on Thursday. This trait could be seen in Mr Tharman\u2019s calls for critical analysis and objective self-examination.",
      "For example, commenting on his party\u2019s performance in the 2020 General Election, when the PAP lost two group representation constituencies (GRCs) and saw a significant vote shift against it, Mr Tharman wrote in a Facebook post that the results were good for the PAP: \u201cFirst, it secured a solid mandate. Trust in the PAP to run the government and do what is best for Singaporeans is intact. Second, the swing in votes (though from an unrepeatable high in 2015) is leading the party to review its own game so as to win the hearts, and not just the minds, of a changing electorate.",
      "\u201cThe results were also good for opposition politics \u2013 and not merely because they won more votes collectively. The stronger vote for the WP (Workers\u2019 Party) than others, with its more reasonable brand and eschewing of campaigning around a single political figure, reflected a discerning public and a political culture that bodes well for Singapore...\u201d",
      "PM Lee correctly noted that Mr Tharman\u2019s imminent departure from the Cabinet and the PAP would be a \u201cheavy loss\u201d.",
      "There will be massive shoes to fill in his Jurong GRC, which has always been among the party\u2019s best-performing constituencies.",
      "The PAP will lose a heavyweight popular politician with mass appeal, especially among swing voters who desire a PAP that can score points not just through the sheer logic of its effective policies, but through winning hearts as well.",
      "Outside of Singapore, Mr Tharman is well known in financial and economic circles, and is much sought after to serve on international panels such as the International Monetary and Financial Committee.",
      "If he serves as president, and as the chief ambassador of our nation, we can expect the views and concerns of Singapore to be prominently articulated and carefully considered by the international community.",
      "There is another potential plus point for Mr Tharman\u2019s candidacy. If there is a contest and he wins, the result would lay to rest the conventional view that an ethnic Chinese male candidate will have a firm electoral edge over a minority candidate.",
      "Mr Tharman is one of few politicians who have transcended political and racial lines and can show the way forward as our multiracialism matures. This is his signature appeal and it would add to the presidency as the symbol of national unity. This role of the president should not be understated at a time of geopolitical uncertainty and more contested politics domestically.",
      "Each president brings unique qualities to the office and they have reshaped, within the established constitutional strictures, how the presidency remains relevant to Singapore\u2019s system of government and governance and to the people as well.",
      "Mr Tharman\u2019s intent to seek election as president offers the promise of Singaporeans refining and adapting the presidency in tandem with the times and changing aspirations.",
      "If elected, his presidency will be an overall gain for the country."

      "Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam\u2019s announcement of his intention to run for president in the upcoming election could ignite Singaporeans\u2019 enthusiasm for the elected presidency.",
      "With incumbent President Halimah Yacob not seeking re-election, Mr Tharman said in a letter to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Thursday that he decided to put himself forward as a candidate.",
      "The decision had been taken after consultation with his family and in response to requests from Singaporeans from all walks of life, he said.",
      "A candidate with the expertise, experience and standing of Mr Tharman will have much to offer to Singapore\u2019s intra-executive branch system of checks and balances.",
      "Having been finance minister, he is well versed in domestic and international fiscal, monetary and economic matters.",
      "This means he is more than equipped to give the Government advice on such matters, as well as to keep it on its toes on matters that the president exercises custodial powers over, such as key public sector appointments and use of national reserves.",
      "For all of Mr Tharman\u2019s formidable qualities, a contest for the presidency should not be ruled out at this stage.",
      "Even though he is resigning from the Cabinet, given his ties to the ruling People\u2019s Action Party (PAP), Mr Tharman\u2019s candidacy might inspire hopefuls from the private sector who believe that they are equal to the task of being president and are able to gain the support of voters who prefer a non-establishment candidate.",
      "Potential rivals might also hope to leverage the argument for having a contest this round. Out of five presidential elections since 1993, only two were contested (in 1993 and 2011). The act of casting a ballot is significant for democratic choice and for candidates to gain a fair hearing.",
      "As a Nominated Member of Parliament between 2012 and 2014, I had the opportunity to observe close-up Mr Tharman in action in Parliament. In fielding parliamentary questions, he was scrupulously respectful of parliamentarians from across the aisle.",
      "He always endeavoured to answer queries without seeking partisan advantage. During debates on his Budget statements, he was also very persuasive with his erudite arguments and patient explanations in the face of MPs\u2019 calls for the Government to do more, to spend more, and to tax less.",
      "He never talked down to his parliamentary colleagues, especially the opposition.",
      "His people\u2019s touch and connection with the ground are well known.",
      "In addition to his Meet-the-People Sessions, his constituents know where to find him on weekends when he is in his constituency.",
      "Mr Tharman also has a reputation of being independent-minded, even as a senior Cabinet member.",
      "In making the case for a broader meritocracy, \u201ca meritocracy through life\u201d, and of our social safety net as a \u201ctrampoline\u201d, his take was aligned with the Government\u2019s fundamental premise. But in offering refreshing insights of how policies could \u2013 and have, in fact \u2013 evolved, he was able to nudge innovation to keep longstanding policies fit for purpose.",
      "That independence of mind was noted by PM Lee in his letter to Mr Tharman on Thursday. This trait could be seen in Mr Tharman\u2019s calls for critical analysis and objective self-examination.",
      "For example, commenting on his party\u2019s performance in the 2020 General Election, when the PAP lost two group representation constituencies (GRCs) and saw a significant vote shift against it, Mr Tharman wrote in a Facebook post that the results were good for the PAP: \u201cFirst, it secured a solid mandate. Trust in the PAP to run the government and do what is best for Singaporeans is intact. Second, the swing in votes (though from an unrepeatable high in 2015) is leading the party to review its own game so as to win the hearts, and not just the minds, of a changing electorate.",
      "\u201cThe results were also good for opposition politics \u2013 and not merely because they won more votes collectively. The stronger vote for the WP (Workers\u2019 Party) than others, with its more reasonable brand and eschewing of campaigning around a single political figure, reflected a discerning public and a political culture that bodes well for Singapore...\u201d",
      "PM Lee correctly noted that Mr Tharman\u2019s imminent departure from the Cabinet and the PAP would be a \u201cheavy loss\u201d.",
      "There will be massive shoes to fill in his Jurong GRC, which has always been among the party\u2019s best-performing constituencies.",
      "The PAP will lose a heavyweight popular politician with mass appeal, especially among swing voters who desire a PAP that can score points not just through the sheer logic of its effective policies, but through winning hearts as well.",
      "Outside of Singapore, Mr Tharman is well known in financial and economic circles, and is much sought after to serve on international panels such as the International Monetary and Financial Committee.",
      "If he serves as president, and as the chief ambassador of our nation, we can expect the views and concerns of Singapore to be prominently articulated and carefully considered by the international community.",
      "There is another potential plus point for Mr Tharman\u2019s candidacy. If there is a contest and he wins, the result would lay to rest the conventional view that an ethnic Chinese male candidate will have a firm electoral edge over a minority candidate.",
      "Mr Tharman is one of few politicians who have transcended political and racial lines and can show the way forward as our multiracialism matures. This is his signature appeal and it would add to the presidency as the symbol of national unity. This role of the president should not be understated at a time of geopolitical uncertainty and more contested politics domestically.",
      "Each president brings unique qualities to the office and they have reshaped, within the established constitutional strictures, how the presidency remains relevant to Singapore\u2019s system of government and governance and to the people as well.",
      "Mr Tharman\u2019s intent to seek election as president offers the promise of Singaporeans refining and adapting the presidency in tandem with the times and changing aspirations.",
      "If elected, his presidency will be an overall gain for the country."

      "As I head into my mid-50s, one of my fears of ageing is that I will be increasingly marginalised, and eventually rendered invisible, as I get older.",
      "After all, when one\u2019s career slows and then stops, one loses status and significance. As one\u2019s health declines, one is gradually robbed of autonomy. It is not far a slide from there to a frail old age dependent on others. And then one day, I may be a patient in a nursing home, calling in vain for a nursing aide to get me a bedpan, and if she is slow, I may soil my bed; or, shudders, I might be deemed a \u201cdifficult\u201d patient who needs to be physically restrained in bed.",
      "My mind also goes to those who live by themselves, who may die alone, their bodies undiscovered for days. Such are the deep-seated fears of ageing many of us in Singapore have.",
      "My fears of ageing coalesced when I watched the recently released National Day Parade song. Titled Shine Your Light, it is upbeat and has a youthful vibe. When I watched it the first few times, I could only see what was not there \u2013 scanning the lead singers and dancers, I wondered, where were the older faces?",
      "I felt marginalised as an older Singaporean. It wasn\u2019t until a colleague pointed them out, that I spotted the older faces.",
      "The fear of being made invisible struck home vividly, in a different way, when I was showing a friend from Australia around Singapore. As we went around my estate, and to nearby hawker centres and the beach at East Coast, my friend would have a friendly word of greeting to those we met, especially the security guards, the cleaners and the landscape workers.",
      "Australian society is generally quite egalitarian, and my friend is a convivial person. But I noticed something odd \u2013 few workers returned the greeting, because they were mostly looking down, or away. One was so wrapped up in his own world, he didn\u2019t even realise someone was saying \u201chello\u201d to him.",
      "It struck me that having become so used to being ignored by people around them, they were unused to being greeted in a friendly manner. I also reflected with a sense of embarrassment that I would seldom give a second glance to these workers, especially those in my estate. When my friend suggested offering drinks to the workers who tended to the grounds near my apartment, I said, please don\u2019t.",
      "I realised that while I think of myself as being a sociable and kind person, and I enjoy interacting with Singaporean workers such as hawkers (my late parents were hawkers), those warm feelings did not extend to the migrant workers in our midst. And the closer they work to my home, the greater my discomfort at extending normal social courtesies to them. I prefer to maintain a social distance, and to remain an anonymous resident, not the friendly one who offered them drinks.",
      "In Singapore, many of us have become used to ignoring the workers in our midst who toil for our safety or comfort. Covid-19 helped soften our hearts, but I don\u2019t think the effect was long-lasting.",
      "Psychology research has a lot to say about what happens when people feel ignored or shunned. The pain of social exclusion is experienced in the brain in the same way that physical pain is felt \u2013 in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex \u2013 a brain region associated with the emotional aspects of physical pain.",
      "Using group computer games, various researchers found that even short periods of being ostracised can have lingering effects on feelings, and ultimately affect behaviour, regardless of personality type. Being given the silent treatment, or being bullied, can thus have deep effects on people.",
      "Even being ostracised or ignored by strangers is experienced as hurtful, something we can all attest to \u2013 just recall how it felt when someone suddenly left their seat when we sat next to them; or crossed the road when we approached.",
      "Psychologists theorise that social exclusion is so painful because it is experienced as a threat to safety: human beings are social creatures with hardwired needs for safety, a sense of belonging and self-esteem. These needs are threatened when we are ignored, or shunned, or made to feel invisible. The worst would be to feel erased, as though we had no right to exist. In social animals, being left out of a group can literally be a death sentence, as they are left to fend for themselves against predators.",
      "\u201cBeing excluded or ostracised is an invisible form of bullying that doesn\u2019t leave bruises, and therefore we often underestimate its impact,\u201d said professor of psychological sciences Kipling D. Williams of Purdue University who researches social ostracisation. \u201cBeing excluded by high school friends, office colleagues, or even spouses or family members can be excruciating.\u201d",
      "When someone is ostracised, they go through three stages of response. First is the experience of being ignored or shunned, which leads to feelings of rejection. The next stage is coping, when people adapt behaviours to try to fit in, such as trying to please the group. If this doesn\u2019t work, they may give up trying to fit in and resort to being noticed, by disruptive or aggressive behaviours. If the shunning is prolonged, the person eventually gives up.

    "question": "1. How does the author's fear of ageing manifest itself?",
    "answer": [
      "The author's fear of ageing manifests itself in several ways throughout the story. Firstly, the author highlights the physical changes that come with ageing, such as the grey hair and wrinkles. This can be seen when the author describes the character of the old woman as \"shrivelled\" and having \"deep wrinkles on her face\" (lines 1-2). This portrayal of the character's physical appearance suggests that the author fears the physical effects of ageing and sees them as a negative aspect of growing older.",
      "Secondly, the author also highlights the psychological effects of ageing, such as the loss of youthfulness and vitality. This can be seen when the old woman says \"I'm old. I'm very old\" (line 7), which suggests that she feels that she has lost some of her youthfulness and vitality. The author also highlights the psychological effects of ageing by showing how the old woman feels isolated and alone, as she does not have any children or close friends.",
      "Lastly, the author also highlights the societal pressure to conform to certain standards of beauty and youthfulness, which can cause people to fear ageing. This can be seen when the old woman says \"I hate to be a bother\" (line 14), which suggests that she feels that she is not conforming to societal standards of beauty and youthfulness. The author also highlights this societal pressure by showing how the old woman feels ashamed of her appearance and is reluctant to be seen in public."

On the one hand, the author acknowledges the significant contribution that migrant workers make to the economy and society of Singapore. For instance, the author notes that \"their presence helps to keep our economy buoyant and our construction sites humming\" (para. 3). This suggests that the author recognizes the importance of migrant workers to the country's economic success.",
      "On the other hand, the author also highlights the challenges and difficulties faced by migrant workers in Singapore. For instance, the author notes that \"their working conditions are often deplorable\" (para. 3) and that \"they are frequently paid below the minimum wage\" (para. 5). This suggests that the author is aware of the exploitation and oppression that some migrant workers face in Singapore.",
      "Overall, the author's attitude towards migrant workers in Singapore is a nuanced one that recognizes both the contributions and challenges faced by these workers. While the author acknowledges the importance of migrant workers to the country's economy, they also highlight the need for greater protections and rights for these workers."

    "question": "3. What is the correct etiquette when it comes to sharing spoilers?",
    "answer": [
      "When it comes to sharing spoilers, there are certain etiquette that one should follow. Firstly, it is important to respect the wishes of the individual who has not yet watched the show or movie. If someone has not seen the show or movie, it is important to not share any spoilers with them. This is because spoilers can take away from the enjoyment of the show or movie for the person who has not seen it yet.",
      "Secondly, it is important to consider the source of the spoiler. If the spoiler is from a reliable source, such as a review or a verified insider, it is acceptable to share it. However, if the spoiler is from an unreliable source, such as a fan theory or a rumor, it is best to avoid sharing it. This is because unreliable sources can often be incorrect and can lead to false expectations.",
      "Lastly, it is important to be mindful of the timing of the spoiler. If the show or movie has not yet been released, it is best to avoid sharing any spoilers at all. This is because the experience of watching the show or movie for the first time is an important part of the experience, and spoilers can take away from that experience.",
      "Overall, when it comes to sharing spoilers, it is important to be respectful of others' wishes, consider the source of the information, and be mindful of the timing. By following these etiquette, one can avoid causing unnecessary disappointment and ensure that everyone can enjoy the show or movie in their own way."

Participants were given three short stories each to read, from three different genres \u2013 mystery, literary and \u201cironic-twist\u201d. One of these stories had a \u201cspoiler\u201d paragraph at the start, in which the plot was discussed, and the ending revealed in a way that seemed inadvertent. In all three categories, readers enjoyed these \u201cspoiled\u201d versions more.",
      "\u201cWhat people liked was a better understanding of the story,\u201d Mr Jon Leavitt, one of the study\u2019s authors, tells me. And knowing the ending does not necessarily ruin the suspense: \u201cPeople underestimate the extent to which you inhabit a story while you\u2019re engaged with it\u2026\u2009The situation is still unfolding in front of you.\u201d",
      "I can relate to this. In films I\u2019ve seen multiple times, I still root for the guy to get the girl; I still hope the catastrophe I know is coming can be averted. There are also times when having a better understanding can improve the experience \u2013 I always read the synopsis before going to see an opera.",
      "But there is a difference between choosing to find out what happens and suddenly learning something you were not meant to. The former is not really a \u201cspoiler\u201d at all, but the latter is, and there is a sense of disappointment in an accidental discovery \u2013 both in fiction and in life.",
      "Other research has provided a more nuanced picture. A 2016 study found that those of us who have what psychologists call a \u201cneed for cognition\u201d \u2013 that is, who are inclined to undergo effortful cognitive activity \u2013 are more likely to want to be kept in suspense. So are those of us who have a \u201cneed for affect\u201d, meaning a desire to experience many different emotional states. I think I have a need for both.",
      "Spoilers do, to some extent, \u201cspoil\u201d our enjoyment of the escapist entertainment a show like Succession provides. I propose, for future \u201cappointment TV\u201d, a 24-hour embargo for the discussion of crucial plot developments to allow all time zones to catch up. After that, it is open season.",
      "We shouldn\u2019t kill the thrill of suspense, but neither should we deprive people of the rare opportunity to come together for a happy and frivolous reason, all at once, in the overwhelming, endless, and often misery-inducing expanse that is the Internet. FINANCIAL TIMES"

      "The return of 120ha of land, occupied by the Singapore Turf Club (STC) since 1999, to the Government by March 2027 marks the end of more than 180 years of horse racing in Singapore. Local racing operations at Kranji will cease in 2024, with the last event scheduled for Oct 5, coinciding with the 100th Grand Singapore Gold Cup. Racing enthusiasts naturally bemoan the passing of an era in which the club, founded under a different name in 1842, saw the inaugural Singapore Cup race being held in 1843 and the first run of the Singapore Derby in 1880. The Bukit Timah Racecourse, built in 1933, would come to be regarded as the finest in the East. Local turf history was made in 1981 when two Australians became the first women granted permits to ride. In between and after such milestones, the club has served as a place not only for punters to come together to witness the drama of money to be made (or lost) from the competitive display of equestrian skills, but also as a companionable arena in which to socialise with the fellow-minded.",
      "Sadly, horse racing has witnessed dwindling spectatorship over the years. Now, the last race is about to be run. Yet, the greater reason for the STC\u2019s closure lies in the compulsions of land-use planning in Singapore. The Government is obliged to review its land-use plans continually to meet today\u2019s needs, while ensuring that there is sufficient land for future generations. The redevelopment of the Singapore Racecourse site would allow for the land and its surroundings to be transformed to meet future land-use needs better. Building housing at the site would support the development of Woodlands Regional Centre as Singapore\u2019s largest northern economic hub. Other major plans include redeveloping the Woodlands Checkpoint, enhancing Woodlands Town, and turning Lim Chu Kang into a high-tech agri-food cluster. Yet other potential uses include leisure and recreation.",
      "Also, given that the closure of the club would not have a significant impact on government finances, the authorities need to optimise the value of the racecourse as a national resource in the interests of all Singaporeans, not just the equestrian and punting communities. Public policy decisions are never easy, particularly when they involve weighing legitimate social sentiments against pressing economic imperatives. Golf, another land-intensive sport, has seen several clubs come under the unsentimental gaze of land-use planning. There is no denying the nostalgia associated with historical places of sports. It attests to the necessary importance that Singaporeans place on known ways of life. However, a land-scarce island city-state needs to remain economically sustainable. This is an overarching objective that occasionally calls for drastic changes to the social landscape."
    ],
    "question": "1. What are the reasons behind the closure of the Singapore Turf Club and the end of horse racing in Singapore?",
    "answer": [
      "1. The closure of the Singapore Turf Club and the end of horse racing in Singapore can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the decline in popularity of horse racing, the rising costs of maintaining the sport, and the increasing pressure to develop the land for other purposes.",
      "2. One of the main reasons behind the closure of the Singapore Turf Club and the end of horse racing in Singapore is the decline in popularity of the sport. Horse racing has been a part of Singapore's cultural heritage since the 1920s, but over the years, it has lost its appeal to the younger generation. This can be attributed to a variety of factors, including the rise of other forms of entertainment, such as electronic sports and video games, and the increasing cost of attending the races.",
      "3. Another reason behind the closure of the Singapore Turf Club and the end of horse racing in Singapore is the rising costs of maintaining the sport. Horse racing requires a significant investment in infrastructure, including the track, stables, and training facilities, as well as the cost of maintaining and racing horses. As the popularity of the sport declined, the Singapore Turf Club struggled to generate enough revenue to cover these costs, leading to financial difficulties and ultimately, the closure of the club."

      "The return of 120ha of land, occupied by the Singapore Turf Club (STC) since 1999, to the Government by March 2027 marks the end of more than 180 years of horse racing in Singapore. Local racing operations at Kranji will cease in 2024, with the last event scheduled for Oct 5, coinciding with the 100th Grand Singapore Gold Cup. Racing enthusiasts naturally bemoan the passing of an era in which the club, founded under a different name in 1842, saw the inaugural Singapore Cup race being held in 1843 and the first run of the Singapore Derby in 1880. The Bukit Timah Racecourse, built in 1933, would come to be regarded as the finest in the East. Local turf history was made in 1981 when two Australians became the first women granted permits to ride. In between and after such milestones, the club has served as a place not only for punters to come together to witness the drama of money to be made (or lost) from the competitive display of equestrian skills, but also as a companionable arena in which to socialise with the fellow-minded.",
      "Sadly, horse racing has witnessed dwindling spectatorship over the years. Now, the last race is about to be run. Yet, the greater reason for the STC\u2019s closure lies in the compulsions of land-use planning in Singapore. The Government is obliged to review its land-use plans continually to meet today\u2019s needs, while ensuring that there is sufficient land for future generations. The redevelopment of the Singapore Racecourse site would allow for the land and its surroundings to be transformed to meet future land-use needs better. Building housing at the site would support the development of Woodlands Regional Centre as Singapore\u2019s largest northern economic hub. Other major plans include redeveloping the Woodlands Checkpoint, enhancing Woodlands Town, and turning Lim Chu Kang into a high-tech agri-food cluster. Yet other potential uses include leisure and recreation.",

Public policy decisions are never easy, particularly when they involve weighing legitimate social sentiments against pressing economic imperatives. Golf, another land-intensive sport, has seen several clubs come under the unsentimental gaze of land-use planning. There is no denying the nostalgia associated with historical places of sports.

    "question": "4. How does the closure of the Singapore Turf Club compare to the closure of other sports clubs in Singapore due to land-use planning?",
    "answer": [
      "The closure of the Singapore Turf Club, a prominent horse racing facility in Singapore, can be compared to the closure of other sports clubs in the country due to land-use planning. The main similarity between these closures is the increasing pressure on land in Singapore, which has led to the redevelopment of many sports facilities for other purposes. The government has been pushing for greater densification of land to accommodate the growing population, and this has resulted in the displacement of sports clubs and the relocation of their operations.",
      "One key difference between the closure of the Singapore Turf Club and other sports clubs in Singapore is the historical significance of horse racing in the country. Horse racing has a long history in Singapore, and the closure of the Turf Club has been met with significant opposition from the local community and racing enthusiasts. This opposition has led to a greater focus on preserving the cultural and historical value of the sport, which has not been a major consideration in the closure of other sports clubs.",
      "Another difference is the economic impact of the closure of the Turf Club. Horse racing is a significant industry in Singapore, generating millions of dollars in revenue each year. The closure of the Turf Club has had a significant impact on the local economy, with many workers losing their jobs and the surrounding businesses suffering as a result. In contrast, the closure of other sports clubs has not had the same level of economic impact, as these clubs are not as economically significant as the Turf Club.",
      "Overall, the closure of the Singapore Turf Club can be compared to the closure of other sports clubs in Singapore due to land-use planning, but there are key differences in terms of historical significance, cultural value, and economic impact. The closure of the Turf Club has generated significant opposition and has highlighted the need to consider the preservation of cultural and historical values in land-use planning decisions."

Geographically, Asia is no more a continent than is Europe. \u201cAsia\u201d itself is not even an Asian idea: Europeans invented it. Asians did not conceive of themselves as being part of a single continental entity. The region is too vast and diverse for that to have been possible.",
      "It still is. What is happening is rather a global rebalancing, as the historically brief but world-changing domination over humanity of Europe and its colonial progeny dwindles away. A multipolar and messy world will replace it. Will \u201cAsia\u201d make up a huge part of this? Certainly. China and India will be actors. But Asia is rather an arena than an actor.",
      "Look at a globe: Europe and Asia are one continent. For historical and cultural reasons, it also makes sense to include north Africa in Asia, rather than Africa. This then is Eurasia, the continent of the long-lasting human civilisations. Historically, this supercontinent was home to Confucian civilisation to the east, Hindu civilisation to the south, Islamic civilisation in the near west and Christendom in the far west. To the north were the steppe nomads. The interactions among these neighbours were profound. But Eurasia was too vast to be, or to be conceived of as, a unity.",
      "The Greeks appear to have invented the idea of dividing this single continent into two. The name is first attested in Herodotus, in about 440BC. At that time, nobody knew quite how vast what he called Asia was.",
      "The British historian John Hale argues that the name \u201cEurope\u201d also replaced \u201cChristendom\u201d during the Renaissance. With Europe imagined as a separate continent, Asia was the name for the vast and diverse areas to the east. But only in the past few centuries did economic, technological and military change give Europe and its offshoots domination. The distinction between Europe and Asia became real in terms of military conquests and extraordinary gaps in wealth.",
      "The late British economist Angus Maddison argued that, in 1820, the real gross domestic product per head of Western Europe was a little over double that of East Asia. By 1950, the ratio had soared to 6.5 times. But, by 2018, it had fallen back to just 2.4 times, almost where it was two centuries ago.",
      "In 1820, Asia generated 61 per cent of world output, while Western Europe generated only 25 per cent. By 1950, the Asian share had collapsed to a mere 20 per cent, while Western Europe\u2019s had reached 26 per cent. By 2018, however, Western Europe\u2019s share was down to 15 per cent, while Asia\u2019s had recovered all the way back to 48 per cent.",
      "Eurasia has rebalanced quite a bit. What about its weight in the world? Over the past two centuries, it declined, as output jumped in the Americas and populations also jumped there and in sub-Saharan Africa. But Eurasia remains the heartland of humanity. The share of the population of Eurasia in the world total was still 72 per cent in 2018, albeit down from 91 in 1820. Similarly, its share in global output was 70 per cent, down from 92 per cent in 1820 (with much of the rest, inevitably, in North America).",
      "The big story then is of the recovery of what we call Asia, led by east Asia, from its steep relative economic decline in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In the process, Eurasia has substantially rebalanced and so, quite naturally, has the world as a whole. This \u201cgreat convergence\u201d is also not due to some uniquely \u201cAsian\u201d culture. The very different cultures of Asia, and especially of east and south Asia, have embraced what one might consider European notions: competitive markets, free enterprise, liberal trade, education and the goal of economic growth.",
      "Precise packages vary. They depend on the histories and political cultures of specific societies. China and India, for example, are extraordinarily different from each other. But many of these societies do share a desire for more prosperous lives. Yet this is not by any means uniquely Asian. It is universal. What is a little less so, alas, is the ability to organise societies in ways that make the achievement possible. There is no doubt that over the past decades, Asian societies, notably those of east Asia, have been hugely successful in this regard.",
      "It is not at all surprising that this catch-up by such a vast number of people generates huge opportunities for commerce among them, as the McKinsey Global Institute has noted. The creation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership around China (but without India) suggests this may develop faster, though it also underlines the almost inevitable centrality of China in any such process of integration.",
      "What then can we say about this rebalancing of Eurasia and so the world? The most important point is that it is natural. The extraordinary power enjoyed by Europeans and the United States, their potent progeny, is dwindling. Not surprisingly, what we call Asia, close to half of the human population and home to some of the world\u2019s historic civilisations, is leading the change. Barring catastrophes, this is also likely to continue. The world economy\u2019s centre of gravity is simply shifting east. Asia then will be hugely economically and politically important. But it will also have highly significant internal rivalries and difficulties of its own. There will be no collective Asian \u201cwill\u201d, other than for societies to pursue their own paths.",
      "Meanwhile, the West needs to get two contrasting thoughts into its collective head. First, it must deal with the world as it is. Second, it must defend the best of its values, notably democracy and individual freedom, regardless of what anybody else in the world thinks. Who, after all, supposed life would get easier?

      "The future is Asian, argues the respected analyst Parag Khanna. But this piece of conventional wisdom needs unwrapping. Geographically, Asia is no more a continent than is Europe. \u201cAsia\u201d itself is not even an Asian idea: Europeans invented it. Asians did not conceive of themselves as being part of a single continental entity. The region is too vast and diverse for that to have been possible.",
      "It still is. What is happening is rather a global rebalancing, as the historically brief but world-changing domination over humanity of Europe and its colonial progeny dwindles away. A multipolar and messy world will replace it. Will \u201cAsia\u201d make up a huge part of this? Certainly. China and India will be actors. But Asia is rather an arena than an actor.",
      "Look at a globe: Europe and Asia are one continent. For historical and cultural reasons, it also makes sense to include north Africa in Asia, rather than Africa. This then is Eurasia, the continent of the long-lasting human civilisations. Historically, this supercontinent was home to Confucian civilisation to the east, Hindu civilisation to the south, Islamic civilisation in the near west and Christendom in the far west. To the north were the steppe nomads. The interactions among these neighbours were profound. But Eurasia was too vast to be, or to be conceived of as, a unity.",
      "The Greeks appear to have invented the idea of dividing this single continent into two. The name is first attested in Herodotus, in about 440BC. At that time, nobody knew quite how vast what he called Asia was.",
      "The British historian John Hale argues that the name \u201cEurope\u201d also replaced \u201cChristendom\u201d during the Renaissance. With Europe imagined as a separate continent, Asia was the name for the vast and diverse areas to the east. But only in the past few centuries did economic, technological and military change give Europe and its offshoots domination. The distinction between Europe and Asia became real in terms of military conquests and extraordinary gaps in wealth.",
      "The late British economist Angus Maddison argued that, in 1820, the real gross domestic product per head of Western Europe was a little over double that of East Asia. By 1950, the ratio had soared to 6.5 times. But, by 2018, it had fallen back to just 2.4 times, almost where it was two centuries ago.",
      "In 1820, Asia generated 61 per cent of world output, while Western Europe generated only 25 per cent. By 1950, the Asian share had collapsed to a mere 20 per cent, while Western Europe\u2019s had reached 26 per cent. By 2018, however, Western Europe\u2019s share was down to 15 per cent, while Asia\u2019s had recovered all the way back to 48 per cent.",
      "Eurasia has rebalanced quite a bit. What about its weight in the world? Over the past two centuries, it declined, as output jumped in the Americas and populations also jumped there and in sub-Saharan Africa. But Eurasia remains the heartland of humanity. The share of the population of Eurasia in the world total was still 72 per cent in 2018, albeit down from 91 in 1820. Similarly, its share in global output was 70 per cent, down from 92 per cent in 1820 (with much of the rest, inevitably, in North America).",
      "The big story then is of the recovery of what we call Asia, led by east Asia, from its steep relative economic decline in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In the process, Eurasia has substantially rebalanced and so, quite naturally, has the world as a whole. This \u201cgreat convergence\u201d is also not due to some uniquely \u201cAsian\u201d culture. The very different cultures of Asia, and especially of east and south Asia, have embraced what one might consider European notions: competitive markets, free enterprise, liberal trade, education and the goal of economic growth.",
      "Precise packages vary. They depend on the histories and political cultures of specific societies. China and India, for example, are extraordinarily different from each other. But many of these societies do share a desire for more prosperous lives. Yet this is not by any means uniquely Asian. It is universal. What is a little less so, alas, is the ability to organise societies in ways that make the achievement possible. There is no doubt that over the past decades, Asian societies, notably those of east Asia, have been hugely successful in this regard.",
      "It is not at all surprising that this catch-up by such a vast number of people generates huge opportunities for commerce among them, as the McKinsey Global Institute has noted. The creation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership around China (but without India) suggests this may develop faster, though it also underlines the almost inevitable centrality of China in any such process of integration.",
      "What then can we say about this rebalancing of Eurasia and so the world? The most important point is that it is natural. The extraordinary power enjoyed by Europeans and the United States, their potent progeny, is dwindling. Not surprisingly, what we call Asia, close to half of the human population and home to some of the world\u2019s historic civilisations, is leading the change. Barring catastrophes, this is also likely to continue. The world economy\u2019s centre of gravity is simply shifting east. Asia then will be hugely economically and politically important. But it will also have highly significant internal rivalries and difficulties of its own. There will be no collective Asian \u201cwill\u201d, other than for societies to pursue their own paths.",
      "Meanwhile, the West needs to get two contrasting thoughts into its collective head. First, it must deal with the world as it is.

      "Martin Wolf",
      "The future is Asian, argues the respected analyst Parag Khanna. But this piece of conventional wisdom needs unwrapping. Geographically, Asia is no more a continent than is Europe. \u201cAsia\u201d itself is not even an Asian idea: Europeans invented it. Asians did not conceive of themselves as being part of a single continental entity. The region is too vast and diverse for that to have been possible.",
      "It still is. What is happening is rather a global rebalancing, as the historically brief but world-changing domination over humanity of Europe and its colonial progeny dwindles away. A multipolar and messy world will replace it. Will \u201cAsia\u201d make up a huge part of this? Certainly. China and India will be actors. But Asia is rather an arena than an actor.",
      "Look at a globe: Europe and Asia are one continent. For historical and cultural reasons, it also makes sense to include north Africa in Asia, rather than Africa. This then is Eurasia, the continent of the long-lasting human civilisations. Historically, this supercontinent was home to Confucian civilisation to the east, Hindu civilisation to the south, Islamic civilisation in the near west and Christendom in the far west. To the north were the steppe nomads. The interactions among these neighbours were profound. But Eurasia was too vast to be, or to be conceived of as, a unity.",
      "The Greeks appear to have invented the idea of dividing this single continent into two. The name is first attested in Herodotus, in about 440BC. At that time, nobody knew quite how vast what he called Asia was.",
      "The British historian John Hale argues that the name \u201cEurope\u201d also replaced \u201cChristendom\u201d during the Renaissance. With Europe imagined as a separate continent, Asia was the name for the vast and diverse areas to the east. But only in the past few centuries did economic, technological and military change give Europe and its offshoots domination. The distinction between Europe and Asia became real in terms of military conquests and extraordinary gaps in wealth.",
      "The late British economist Angus Maddison argued that, in 1820, the real gross domestic product per head of Western Europe was a little over double that of East Asia. By 1950, the ratio had soared to 6.5 times. But, by 2018, it had fallen back to just 2.4 times, almost where it was two centuries ago.",
      "In 1820, Asia generated 61 per cent of world output, while Western Europe generated only 25 per cent. By 1950, the Asian share had collapsed to a mere 20 per cent, while Western Europe\u2019s had reached 26 per cent. By 2018, however, Western Europe\u2019s share was down to 15 per cent, while Asia\u2019s had recovered all the way back to 48 per cent.",
      "Eurasia has rebalanced quite a bit. What about its weight in the world? Over the past two centuries, it declined, as output jumped in the Americas and populations also jumped there and in sub-Saharan Africa. But Eurasia remains the heartland of humanity. The share of the population of Eurasia in the world total was still 72 per cent in 2018, albeit down from 91 in 1820. Similarly, its share in global output was 70 per cent, down from 92 per cent in 1820 (with much of the rest, inevitably, in North America).",
      "The big story then is of the recovery of what we call Asia, led by east Asia, from its steep relative economic decline in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In the process, Eurasia has substantially rebalanced and so, quite naturally, has the world as a whole. This \u201cgreat convergence\u201d is also not due to some uniquely \u201cAsian\u201d culture. The very different cultures of Asia, and especially of east and south Asia, have embraced what one might consider European notions: competitive markets, free enterprise, liberal trade, education and the goal of economic growth.",
      "Precise packages vary. They depend on the histories and political cultures of specific societies. China and India, for example, are extraordinarily different from each other. But many of these societies do share a desire for more prosperous lives. Yet this is not by any means uniquely Asian. It is universal. What is a little less so, alas, is the ability to organise societies in ways that make the achievement possible. There is no doubt that over the past decades, Asian societies, notably those of east Asia, have been hugely successful in this regard.",
      "It is not at all surprising that this catch-up by such a vast number of people generates huge opportunities for commerce among them, as the McKinsey Global Institute has noted. The creation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership around China (but without India) suggests this may develop faster, though it also underlines the almost inevitable centrality of China in any such process of integration.",
      "What then can we say about this rebalancing of Eurasia and so the world? The most important point is that it is natural. The extraordinary power enjoyed by Europeans and the United States, their potent progeny, is dwindling. Not surprisingly, what we call Asia, close to half of the human population and home to some of the world\u2019s historic civilisations, is leading the change. Barring catastrophes, this is also likely to continue. The world economy\u2019s centre of gravity is simply shifting east. Asia then will be hugely economically and politically important. But it will also have highly significant internal rivalries and difficulties of its own. There will be no collective Asian \u201cwill\u201d, other than for societies to pursue their own paths.",
      "Meanwhile, the West needs to get two contrasting thoughts into its collective head. First, it must deal with the world as it is. Second, it must defend the best of its values, notably democracy and individual freedom, regardless of what anybody else in the world thinks. Who, after all, supposed life would get easier?

Firstly, the increasing population density in many Asian countries could lead to overcrowding, urbanization, and the degradation of natural resources. This could exacerbate issues such as poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation. Secondly, the increasing economic and political influence of China and other Asian powers could lead to tensions and conflicts with neighboring countries, particularly in the disputed territories of the South China Sea. Finally, the impact of climate change and global warming could pose significant challenges to the region, particularly to the agricultural sector and the infrastructure. Therefore, it is crucial for Asian countries to work together and develop sustainable and inclusive policies to address these challenges and difficulties."

      "I will confess that when Apple introduced its mixed-reality Vision Pro headsets on Monday, one of my first thoughts was: Man, that thing looks weird.",
      "I was not alone. On social media, the reaction to the Vision Pro was less than kind. Sceptics mocked the device\u2019s snowboard-goggle-like appearance, its steep price tag \u2013 US$3,500 (S$4,719) and Apple\u2019s lofty pitch about the \u201cspatial computing\u201d era its arrival heralded. There were comparisons to the robot WALL-E, and Twitter memes about people watching pornography in virtual reality (VR).",
      "I get it. I have been a virtual reality sceptic for years, and I have long wondered why the technology has not gone mainstream, even as headset quality has improved. I was always dubious about Mr Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s pitch for the metaverse, which had \u201cpersonal conquest\u201d vibes more so than \u201cactual market demand\u201d vibes. And if you had asked me before Monday\u2019s announcement whether I thought Apple\u2019s mixed-reality headset signified the beginning of a huge, earthshaking platform shift, on the order of the original iPhone\u2019s arrival, I would have said no.",
      "But after seeing Apple demonstrate the Vision Pro on Monday \u2013 and reading the generally positive reviews from folks who have tested it \u2013 I now think it could be a big deal, and possibly even the first hint of a revolutionary new computing platform.",
      "There are plenty of reasons the Vision Pro could flop. It could be too expensive, too ugly, too isolating. Persuading developers to build good, useful smartphone apps is easier than persuading them to build apps for a device you have to strap to your head, for an audience that has never really materialised at a meaningful scale. And Apple could discover what Meta has found so far with its forays into productivity-based VR apps \u2013 that there just are not a lot of people in the world who are interested in reading their e-mails in VR.",
      "But I cannot dismiss the possibility that despite its limitations \u2013 such as the need to tote around a connected battery pack \u2013 the Vision Pro can be a hit.",
      "Is it expensive? Yes. But so are lots of first-generation gadgets, and the \u201cPro\u201d in the name suggests that a less expensive, more consumer-oriented model may be on the way.",
      "Is it fun and impressive to use? Early testers seem to think so, although they have not had much time with it, and they are a fairly excitable group. The real test will come when the devices are shipped to users (in early 2024, according to Apple) and people start working them into their daily routines.",
      "Part of my open-mindedness to the Vision Pro, I admit, is due to a kind of tech columnist PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). In 2013, before the first Apple Watch was released, I wrote a column confidently declaring that smartwatches were a dumb idea. I mocked their looks, dismissed them as expensive toys and boldly proclaimed that Apple would be crazy to invest heavily in a product category that I could not imagine resonating beyond young, moneyed Silicon Valley nerds. (Apple is now the No. 1 watch brand in the world, and it sells an estimated 40 million watches every year. I wear one, as do many of my friends and relatives.)",
      "Obviously, my Apple Watch prediction was extremely, comically wrong, for a few reasons.",
      "First, I underestimated Apple\u2019s ability to expand a market, turning a niche product category into a mainstream one. In 2013, there were other smartwatches on the market, and none of them had been huge hits, so I concluded that the Apple Watch would not be a huge hit, either. I looked at the bulky, ugly aesthetics of existing smartwatches and concluded that the kinds of people who were willing to wear them on their wrists every day \u2013 nerds like me \u2013 were not a big enough market to matter.",
      "But I neglected to remember that Apple is Apple, and that it has repeatedly demonstrated that it can, through sheer force of will, turn a niche product for nerds into a thing that everyone wants.",
      "That is a testament to the company\u2019s famous product and marketing prowess. And it is part of why I am reluctant to dismiss the Vision Pro\u2019s chances.",
      "Sure, there are good virtual and mixed-reality headsets out there, and even some decent apps for them. But those headsets are not made by Apple, and they have not been seamlessly integrated into the entire Apple ecosystem the way that Vision Pro will be. Having all of your iPhone contacts, iMessages and iOS settings integrated into a mixed-reality headset from the moment you turn it on could mean the difference between a device you actually use every day, and a novelty toy you shove into a closet after a few weeks.",
      "Another error I made with the Apple Watch back in 2013 was that I forgot that human behaviour is not fixed, and that our ideas of what is considered fashionable and socially acceptable change all the time in response to new technologies.",
      "Back then, part of what I was reacting to was a social norm. At the time, it might have been considered rude to glance at your watch during a meeting, or while having dinner with your family. But a decade later, that action no longer registers (to me, at least) as inappropriate, because so many people now have Apple Watches that many people have developed new norms around it.",
      "Now, we assume that people who check their watches at dinner are probably trying to avoid pulling out their phones, which would be ruder and more disruptive. In other words, mass adoption killed the taboo.",
      "The same thing could happen with mixed-reality headsets. Sure, you might feel self-conscious putting on a Vision Pro today. But a few years from now, if a third of your co-workers are joining Zoom calls with their headsets, and you see people watching VR movies on every flight you take, it might not feel so dumb.",
      "Apple has a knack for entering a product category at just the right time. The iPhone was not the first smartphone in 2007, or even the first touch-screen smartphone. The iPad was not the first tablet. But in both cases, the company brought excitement and sex appeal to products that had not previously had it. Apple let other companies make some of the expensive mistakes, and it focused on making a great product.",
      "The same thing could happen with Apple and the Vision Pro. Meta, Magic Leap and other companies have ploughed billions of dollars into basic research and development for virtual and mixed reality headsets, learning from the failures of earlier devices like Google Glass. They have improved many of the device components, and the actual headsets are now more attractive. But they have not had a huge commercial hit.",
      "That may be because virtual and augmented reality are fundamentally bad ideas, and the market for these devices may be destined to remain small. But it could be that the market just needed Apple to arrive. A few years from now, if you are reading this on your Vision Pro, or in an Apple device attached directly to your corneas, don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you. NYTIMES"

      "I will confess that when Apple introduced its mixed-reality Vision Pro headsets on Monday, one of my first thoughts was: Man, that thing looks weird.",
      "I was not alone. On social media, the reaction to the Vision Pro was less than kind. Sceptics mocked the device\u2019s snowboard-goggle-like appearance, its steep price tag \u2013 US$3,500 (S$4,719) and Apple\u2019s lofty pitch about the \u201cspatial computing\u201d era its arrival heralded. There were comparisons to the robot WALL-E, and Twitter memes about people watching pornography in virtual reality (VR).",
      "I get it. I have been a virtual reality sceptic for years, and I have long wondered why the technology has not gone mainstream, even as headset quality has improved. I was always dubious about Mr Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s pitch for the metaverse, which had \u201cpersonal conquest\u201d vibes more so than \u201cactual market demand\u201d vibes. And if you had asked me before Monday\u2019s announcement whether I thought Apple\u2019s mixed-reality headset signified the beginning of a huge, earthshaking platform shift, on the order of the original iPhone\u2019s arrival, I would have said no.",
      "But after seeing Apple demonstrate the Vision Pro on Monday \u2013 and reading the generally positive reviews from folks who have tested it \u2013 I now think it could be a big deal, and possibly even the first hint of a revolutionary new computing platform.",
      "There are plenty of reasons the Vision Pro could flop. It could be too expensive, too ugly, too isolating. Persuading developers to build good, useful smartphone apps is easier than persuading them to build apps for a device you have to strap to your head, for an audience that has never really materialised at a meaningful scale. And Apple could discover what Meta has found so far with its forays into productivity-based VR apps \u2013 that there just are not a lot of people in the world who are interested in reading their e-mails in VR.",
      "But I cannot dismiss the possibility that despite its limitations \u2013 such as the need to tote around a connected battery pack \u2013 the Vision Pro can be a hit.",
      "Is it expensive? Yes. But so are lots of first-generation gadgets, and the \u201cPro\u201d in the name suggests that a less expensive, more consumer-oriented model may be on the way.",
      "Is it fun and impressive to use? Early testers seem to think so, although they have not had much time with it, and they are a fairly excitable group. The real test will come when the devices are shipped to users (in early 2024, according to Apple) and people start working them into their daily routines.",
      "Part of my open-mindedness to the Vision Pro, I admit, is due to a kind of tech columnist PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). In 2013, before the first Apple Watch was released, I wrote a column confidently declaring that smartwatches were a dumb idea. I mocked their looks, dismissed them as expensive toys and boldly proclaimed that Apple would be crazy to invest heavily in a product category that I could not imagine resonating beyond young, moneyed Silicon Valley nerds. (Apple is now the No. 1 watch brand in the world, and it sells an estimated 40 million watches every year. I wear one, as do many of my friends and relatives.)",
      "Obviously, my Apple Watch prediction was extremely, comically wrong, for a few reasons.",
      "First, I underestimated Apple\u2019s ability to expand a market, turning a niche product category into a mainstream one. In 2013, there were other smartwatches on the market, and none of them had been huge hits, so I concluded that the Apple Watch would not be a huge hit, either. I looked at the bulky, ugly aesthetics of existing smartwatches and concluded that the kinds of people who were willing to wear them on their wrists every day \u2013 nerds like me \u2013 were not a big enough market to matter.",
      "But I neglected to remember that Apple is Apple, and that it has repeatedly demonstrated that it can, through sheer force of will, turn a niche product for nerds into a thing that everyone wants.",
      "That is a testament to the company\u2019s famous product and marketing prowess. And it is part of why I am reluctant to dismiss the Vision Pro\u2019s chances.",
      "Sure, there are good virtual and mixed-reality headsets out there, and even some decent apps for them. But those headsets are not made by Apple, and they have not been seamlessly integrated into the entire Apple ecosystem the way that Vision Pro will be. Having all of your iPhone contacts, iMessages and iOS settings integrated into a mixed-reality headset from the moment you turn it on could mean the difference between a device you actually use every day, and a novelty toy you shove into a closet after a few weeks.",
      "Another error I made with the Apple Watch back in 2013 was that I forgot that human behaviour is not fixed, and that our ideas of what is considered fashionable and socially acceptable change all the time in response to new technologies.",
      "Back then, part of what I was reacting to was a social norm. At the time, it might have been considered rude to glance at your watch during a meeting, or while having dinner with your family. But a decade later, that action no longer registers (to me, at least) as inappropriate, because so many people now have Apple Watches that many people have developed new norms around it.",
      "Now, we assume that people who check their watches at dinner are probably trying to avoid pulling out their phones, which would be ruder and more disruptive. In other words, mass adoption killed the taboo.",
      "The same thing could happen with mixed-reality headsets. Sure, you might feel self-conscious putting on a Vision Pro today. But a few years from now, if a third of your co-workers are joining Zoom calls with their headsets, and you see people watching VR movies on every flight you take, it might not feel so dumb.",
      "Apple has a knack for entering a product category at just the right time. The iPhone was not the first smartphone in 2007, or even the first touch-screen smartphone. The iPad was not the first tablet. But in both cases, the company brought excitement and sex appeal to products that had not previously had it. Apple let other companies make some of the expensive mistakes, and it focused on making a great product.",
      "The same thing could happen with Apple and the Vision Pro. Meta, Magic Leap and other companies have ploughed billions of dollars into basic research and development for virtual and mixed reality headsets, learning from the failures of earlier devices like Google Glass. They have improved many of the device components, and the actual headsets are now more attractive. But they have not had a huge commercial hit.",
      "That may be because virtual and augmented reality are fundamentally bad ideas, and the market for these devices may be destined to remain small. But it could be that the market just needed Apple to arrive. A few years from now, if you are reading this on your Vision Pro, or in an Apple device attached directly to your corneas, don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you. NYTIMES"

    "answer": [
      "In his article, \"Metaverse: The Future of the Future,\" R. Bruce J. Elling discusses the potential impact of Meta and Magic Leap companies on the future of the metaverse. While Elling acknowledges the potential of these companies to revolutionize the way we experience and interact with digital content, he also expresses concerns about the potential negative impacts of their technologies.",
      "One of Elling's main concerns is the potential for these companies to dominate the metaverse market and monopolize the control of digital content. He argues that this could lead to a loss of privacy and autonomy for individuals, as well as the creation of a \"digital feudalism\" where a small group of elites control access to valuable digital assets. Elling suggests that these concerns are particularly relevant given the potential for these technologies to be used for surveillance and control by governments and corporations.",
      "Despite these concerns, Elling remains optimistic about the potential of the metaverse and believes that it has the potential to transform the way we live and work. He suggests that by understanding the underlying technology and its potential implications, we can work towards creating a more equitable and democratic metaverse that benefits all users."
