      "I grew up in Klang, a city in Selangor in Malaysia, where my father worked as a civil servant. After his death, my mother, older brother and I moved to Singapore where my uncle gave us a place to live. We lived modestly, with my father\u2019s government pension and financial help from my uncle. There was no money for extras.",
      "It was the absence of my father that marked my days back then. I missed how he doted on my brother and me, how he came home with presents and took us out to the movies. Most of all, I missed how he answered all our endless questions, which came easy for him as he had encyclopaedic knowledge.",

      "When I was around six years old, our family visited the Batu Caves Hindu temple near Kuala Lumpur. The mouth of Batu Caves was at the top of numerous and steep steps. When my father said there were 272 steps, I told him I would not make it all the way to the top.",
      "His reply gave me the motivation to go for it: Getting to the top was just a matter of taking 16 steps to reach a landing, then another 16 steps to get to the next one, and if I kept going from one landing to another, I would reach the caves.",
      "And so we climbed \u2013 my father holding my hand and both of us counting the steps out loud until we reached the caves.",
      "The lesson learnt: Don\u2019t be daunted by a big problem, as it can be tackled by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts.",
      "I applied this lesson throughout my life \u2013 breaking a task into smaller steps, stages and sequences to eventually get it done. This approach to problem-solving has stood me in good stead in my personal and professional life.",
      "When I was 45, I made a mid-career switch from stockbroking to journalism, joining CNA as a business reporter.

In time, with training and learning on the job, I became a senior editor of the station\u2019s business programme.",
      "Another lesson I learnt from my father was foundation-building. I remember as a child stacking building blocks, putting a square or round piece on top of another to see how high I could build the tower before the whole structure came crashing down.",
      "My first few attempts collapsed in double-quick time. After seeing my failed attempts, my father showed me how I needed to build a strong foundation in order to get taller towers. I should not rush it, and take care to align the pieces to get a more stable structure.",
      "I followed his advice, and my towers stood tall and did not collapse.",
      "Building strong foundations became an integral part of everything I did in life. I was always well prepared before an examination, I trained hard before running a marathon, and I researched extensively before covering a news event.",
      "My father also made sure he built a strong foundation in the education of his two sons. When we turned three, he introduced us to the alphabet, taught us numbers and read books to us to build up our vocabulary. He made us do simple sums and memorise the multiplication table.",
      "On our family trips to other towns in Malaysia, my father would make us solve mental maths problems. To keep us occupied during the long drives, he asked us to work out how long it would take to get to the destination based on the speed of the car and the distance left to go.",
      "There were also memory games, such as naming the capital cities of countries and the dates of historical events.",
      "We went to the library regularly to borrow books, and he bought junior encyclopaedias to help us improve our general knowledge. He helped us with homework and reminded us to always go beyond what we learnt in school.",
      "I grew up loving books and studied English literature in school. I developed a passion for writing and published two novels.",
      "My father was a kind-hearted and generous man. He gave to charities readily and lent money to his cash-strapped colleagues. Our barber, who needed money for his family in India, borrowed from my father, who never asked for the loan to be repaid.",
      "He talked to us about faith, and most importantly, showed us through his actions the importance of living life with honesty and integrity.",
      "He told me never to take what was not mine at times when I found things. When I was a Scout in school, he reminded me during Job Week that I should do my best, as I was getting paid for the work. He told me he always gave his all, for the organisations he worked in and the people he worked with.",
      "Of course, my father had his weaknesses. He loved food too much, often overate and rarely exercised. As he was only in his 40s when he died from typhoid fever, I have always wondered if he could have recovered from the bacterial infection if he had taken better care of his health.",
      "My father could also be indecisive and lacked composure. I remember an incident when a beehive at the back of our house fell to the ground, and my father ran for cover from the swarm of bees. My mother\u2019s quick thinking in setting the hive on fire saved the day.",
      "Despite his shortcomings and his brief time with us, he had a lasting impact on our lives. I would like to think that he had a hand in the success story of my brother, who rose through the ranks to become a rear-admiral in the Singapore Navy and was Chief of Navy before he retired.",
      "Although I do not have children of my own, I do have advice for all the fathers out there \u2013 teach your children well, as what you say will leave an indelible impression and stay with them for the rest of their lives. Just like how my father\u2019s words and wise counsel have guided me through mine.",
      "So this Father\u2019s Day, I will gaze upon the photo of my dad, and thank him for making me who I am today."

    "question": "1. What lessons did Frederick Lim's father teach him that have guided him throughout his life and shaped his personality?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "Frederick Lim, a successful entrepreneur, has credited his father for teaching him valuable lessons that have guided him throughout his life and shaped his personality. One of the most significant lessons that his father taught him was the importance of hard work and perseverance. Lim's father instilled in him the belief that success does not come easily, and that one must be willing to put in the effort and work hard to achieve their goals. This lesson has stayed with Lim throughout his life, and he has applied it in his business ventures, where he has been known for his relentless work ethic.",
      "Another lesson that Lim's father taught him was the value of honesty and integrity.

This lesson has helped Lim maintain his reputation as a trustworthy and honest businessman, which has been essential to his success.",
      "Finally, Lim's father taught him the importance of being humble and grateful. Despite his success, Lim has never forgotten where he came from and has always remained humble.

    "question": "2. How did Frederick Lim apply the \"272-steps lesson\" in his life?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "In the book \"Atomic Habits,\" author James Clear introduces the concept of the \"272-step lesson,\" which refers to the idea that achieving a goal is not about taking a single step, but rather about taking many small, incremental steps over a long period of time. In this context, Frederick Lim, a successful entrepreneur, applied the \"272-step lesson\" in his life by breaking down his goals into smaller, achievable tasks and focusing on making progress one step at a time.",
      "One way that Lim applied this concept was by setting daily and weekly habits that helped him move closer to his long-term goals. For example, he might spend a certain amount of time each day working on a specific project, or he might make a point of reaching out to potential customers or investors on a regular basis. By focusing on these small, incremental steps, Lim was able to make steady progress towards his goals without feeling overwhelmed or discouraged.",
      "Another way that Lim applied the \"272-step lesson\" was by tracking his progress and celebrating small victories along the way. By keeping a record of his daily habits and achievements, he was able to see how far he had come and stay motivated to continue making progress. This focus on progress, rather than perfection, allowed Lim to maintain momentum and avoid getting discouraged by setbacks or obstacles.",
      "Finally, Lim also applied the \"272-step lesson\" by being open to learning and adapting along the way. By remaining curious and open-minded, he was able to identify new opportunities and make adjustments to his approach as needed. This willingness to learn and adapt helped Lim stay focused on his goals and avoid getting stuck in unproductive patterns of behavior.",
      "Overall, by applying the \"272-step lesson\" in his life, Frederick Lim was able to achieve his goals through consistent, incremental progress. This approach allowed him to stay focused, motivated, and adaptable, and ultimately led to his success as an entrepreneur."

After his death, my mother, older brother and I moved to Singapore where my uncle gave us a place to live. We lived modestly, with my father\u2019s government pension and financial help from my uncle. There was no money for extras.",

      "His reply gave me the motivation to go for it: Getting to the top was just a matter of taking 16 steps to reach a landing, then another 16 steps to get to the next one, and if I kept going from one landing to another, I would reach the caves.",

As I knew little about TV production, I applied what my father taught me \u2013 do things in steps, stages and sequences. In time, with training and learning on the job, I became a senior editor of the station\u2019s business programme.",

    "question": "1. What is reverse ageism, and how does it affect younger employees in the post-pandemic era?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "Reverse ageism is a form of discrimination that involves treating individuals differently based on their age, with older individuals being discriminated against. In the post-pandemic era, reverse ageism can have a significant impact on younger employees, particularly in the workplace.",
      "One way reverse ageism affects younger employees is through negative stereotypes and assumptions about their abilities. Older colleagues may view younger employees as inexperienced or unprepared, and may be less likely to give them opportunities for growth and development. This can lead to younger employees feeling undervalued and unappreciated, which can negatively impact their job satisfaction and motivation.",
      "Another way reverse ageism can affect younger employees is through a lack of representation and inclusion in decision-making processes. Older colleagues may be more likely to hold positions of power and influence, which can limit the opportunities for younger employees to have their voices heard and their ideas considered. This can lead to a lack of diversity in decision-making, which can ultimately harm the organization as a whole.",
      "Finally, reverse ageism can also affect younger employees in terms of their physical and mental health. Older colleagues may view younger employees as being more resilient and able to handle the demands of the job, which can lead to unrealistic expectations and a lack of support for younger employees. This can lead to increased stress and burnout, which can have negative effects on both physical and mental health.",
      "Overall, reverse ageism can have significant negative effects on younger employees in the post-pandemic era, and it is important for organizations to be aware of and address this form of discrimination in order to create a more inclusive and equitable workplace."

    "question": "2. How does ageism intersect with other aspects of a person's identity, such as gender and economic status?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "Ageism is not limited to affecting one's age and can intersect with other aspects of a person's identity, such as gender and economic status. For example, older women are often viewed as less competent and less deserving of opportunities than older men, and this is often referred to as the \"double bind\" for women as they age. Similarly, older individuals from marginalized communities, such as those who identify as LGBTQ+ or come from low-income backgrounds, may face additional barriers and discrimination due to their age, gender, and economic status.",
      "It is important to recognize that ageism can manifest in subtle ways, such as being overlooked for promotions or not being taken seriously in meetings, and can have significant impacts on an individual's career and personal life. Furthermore, ageism can also perpetuate cycles of inequality, as younger generations may be less likely to hire or work with older individuals, perpetuating stereotypes and limiting opportunities for all parties involved.",
      "Therefore, it is crucial to raise awareness of ageism and its intersection with other aspects of identity, and to work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society for all individuals, regardless of age, gender, or economic status. This can be achieved through education, advocacy, and promoting diversity and representation in all aspects of society."

Employers can also address reverse ageism by implementing flexible work arrangements, such as remote work or flexible hours, which can help older workers balance their work and personal responsibilities. This can help to reduce age-related stereotypes and assumptions about older workers' abilities and productivity, and create a more supportive and accommodating work environment for employees of all ages."

The Rail Corridor, on the other hand, can serve as a potential transportation route for visitors, connecting the site to other areas in the region.",
      "Moreover, the site's location near the Mandai Mangrove and Mudflat Nature Park presents a unique opportunity to incorporate eco-friendly and sustainable design elements, such as green roofs, rainwater harvesting, and the use of natural materials. These design elements can help minimize the site's environmental impact and contribute to the preservation of the surrounding natural resources.",

    "question": "3. What role do attitudes towards greenery play in the decision to redevelop the STC site, and how might they influence future land use planning in Singapore?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "1. Attitudes towards greenery play a significant role in the decision to redevelop the STC site, as they reflect the values and priorities of the community. A positive attitude towards greenery may lead to greater support for redevelopment plans, while a negative attitude may result in resistance to change. In the case of the STC site, the community's desire for a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly development likely influenced the decision to incorporate greenery into the redevelopment plans.",
      "2. Attitudes towards greenery can also influence future land use planning in Singapore. As a city-state with limited land resources, Singapore has prioritized the integration of green spaces into urban planning to promote sustainability and enhance quality of life. The success of the redevelopment of the STC site may inspire other developers and planners to prioritize greenery in future projects, leading to a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly urban landscape.",
      "3. Attitudes towards greenery can also impact the economic viability of redevelopment projects. Developers may prioritize green spaces in their plans to attract environmentally-conscious tenants and buyers, which can lead to higher rental rates and property values. Additionally, green spaces can provide a range of ecosystem services, such as air purification and stormwater management, which can reduce costs associated with urban development. Therefore, attitudes towards greenery can play a critical role in shaping the future of land use planning in Singapore."

      "The horse racing fraternity has reacted with dismay to the Government\u2019s recent decision to close the Singapore Turf Club (STC) in Kranji.",
      "This will mean the end of the 180-year-old sport in Singapore and the loss of hundreds of jobs. It also leaves horse owners, jockeys and the horses themselves facing an uncertain future.",
      "Despite the sympathy for STC\u2019s employees, the 120ha of land freed up by the club\u2019s closure opens up many possibilities for other urgent land use requirements.",
      "Put simply, one key aim of land use planning is to use any given piece of land to bring the most benefits to the most people.",
      "With local horse racing experiencing declining spectatorship over the years, it makes sense to redevelop the land on which the STC sits to meet urgent housing demand, especially for public housing.",
      "The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has indicated that planning for the site will take two or three years. Beyond the housing, leisure and recreation uses already announced, it is too early to speculate what else might come up on the land.",
      "However, there are hints about how government agencies plan to approach the site.",
      "A spokesman for the URA has noted that Singapore\u2019s northern region as a whole is very \u201cgreen\u201d and that the authority would take the surrounding context into account.",
      "The surrounding physical context includes the Mandai Mangrove and Mudflat Nature Park to the north, and the Kranji Reservoir, Kranji Coastal Nature Park and Kranji Marshes to the north-east and east. The Rail Corridor is also just north of the STC site.",
      "Beyond physical factors, general attitudes towards greenery have evolved over the years.",
      "Indeed, it was reported earlier in June in The Straits Times that a study by the National University of Singapore (NUS) Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions quantified what I had long noticed among my own friends and acquaintances \u2013 that Singaporeans value views of greenery enough to pay a premium for them.",
      "This means we have moved beyond equating greenery only with formal parks or nature areas.",
      "The Rail Corridor, for example, is a green leisure and recreation space for daytime joggers and walkers, but also doubles as a route for cyclists going to work, and a linkway for wildlife connectivity at night.",
      "The Clementi Nature Corridor announced by the National Parks Board in July 2021 as an ecological connection between Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and the Southern Ridges, and the 400ha Sungei Buloh Nature Park Network, are emblematic of the Government\u2019s current science-based approach to managing the balance between nature conservation and development needs.",
      "In that regard, beyond parks and landscaped greenery, there could be an opportunity for incorporating nature corridors in any new town at the STC site to improve the ecological links between existing nature areas around Kranji.",
      "The recent NUS study also noted that the area of greenery per person within residential towns declined from 17.7 sq m to 13.7 sq m from 2008 to 2020. Given the premium we place on it, I believe most Singaporeans would welcome it if we could add to the amount of greenery in Singapore.",
      "According to news reports, URA has not ruled out the possibility of retaining some STC structures if it makes sense to keep or repurpose them for other uses.",
      "Adaptive re-use of existing buildings was in the news recently when The Business Times reported London-based environmental engineer Patrick Bellew and Singapore building experts arguing that in terms of embodied carbon, it is not environmentally sustainable to demolish buildings and rebuild them.",
      "Embodied carbon refers to the greenhouse gases that are released when building materials are made, transported and assembled. According to Mr Bellew, even for \u201csuper green\u201d buildings, embodied carbon constitutes about 80 per cent of the carbon emissions in the first 50 years of a building\u2019s lifespan.",
      "In other words, no matter how environmentally sustainable a building is when operational, a lot of its carbon emissions had already been expended during its construction and early years.",
      "Adaptive re-use of existing buildings would help negate the excessive carbon emissions inherent in the demolish-and-rebuild model.",
      "With the STC now about 25 years old, its buildings are good candidates for adaptive re-use as they are unlikely to be near the end of their structural lifespan.",
      "In fact, there are precedents overseas of sporting stadiums being repurposed for housing and other uses.",
      "One example is the old Highbury stadium, the home of Arsenal Football Club for 93 years until 2006. The stadium was converted into apartments for the new Highbury Square development.",
      "In the American city of Indianapolis, the 80-year-old grandstand of the historic Bush baseball stadium was converted into an apartment complex known as Stadium Lofts, which opened in 2013.",
      "This, of course, does not necessarily mean that a different building, like STC\u2019s grandstand, can be similarly repurposed.",
      "Would retaining the grandstand unacceptably constrain the development potential and spatial planning of the rest of the site? Is the building suitable to be repurposed for the uses being considered, and would the effort be prohibitively expensive or too time-consuming to be practical?",
      "These are tough questions and hard economics, and pragmatism may render adaptive re-use of the grandstand unfeasible.",
      "However, there is value in considering the preservation of the intangible social memory of horse racing\u2019s long history in Singapore once it is gone, and honouring those who were part of it.",
      "If there is scope for adaptive re-use of the grandstand, one can imagine a day in the not-too-distant future when former STC employees or horse trainers could visit the lush and green new town and point out the repurposed grandstand to their children.",

      "1. Incorporating nature corridors in the STC site can have numerous benefits for the ecosystem. By connecting existing nature areas around Kranji, it can help in preserving and promoting biodiversity. This can be achieved by providing a pathway for animals to move between different habitats, enabling them to access food, water, and mates.",
      "2. Nature corridors can also provide several benefits for human populations. They can serve as recreational spaces for residents, improving their quality of life and promoting physical and mental well-being. Additionally, nature corridors can help in reducing the urban heat island effect by providing shade and helping to regulate temperature.",
      "3. Incorporating nature corridors can also have economic benefits. By preserving and enhancing the natural environment, it can increase property values and attract tourists, leading to increased revenue for local businesses. Furthermore, nature corridors can also help in mitigating the risk of natural disasters, such as floods and landslides, by reducing the amount of runoff and stabilizing the soil."

      "According to real estate consultancy Knight Frank, office rents in the CBD rose in the first quarter of 2023, driven by a combination of tight supply and strong demand.",
      "Singapore is also facing high demand for housing, which has translated into rising home prices and rents. In the first quarter of 2023, private home prices rose by 3.3 per cent while those of resale HDB flats rose by 0.9 per cent.",
      "As the space needs of Singapore\u2019s residents and its industries continue to grow, it will become necessary to redevelop existing sites to build more housing estates, innovation parks, satellite business districts and other projects.",
      "Besides driving urban redevelopment, the URA is also in charge of conserving historically significant buildings. According to the authority, conservation requires an appreciation and understanding of the architecture and structure of historic buildings, with the aim of retaining their inherent spirit and original ambience.",

      "In Singapore, horse racing average attendance has fallen from 6,000 per day in 2019 to current levels of 2,600 per day.",
      "Beyond its size, a racecourse is also a highly specialised facility that is designed to provide space for the care, training and racing of horses.",
      "At the Singapore Turf Club, there are multiple tracks for different race types and training purposes, racing and resting stables to accommodate horses, and an equine pool for training purposes. There are also a grandstand and carparks for accommodating spectators on race days.",
      "It will not be easy to convert such facilities for residential and commercial uses, nor will it be an optimal use of space and resources.",

      "Urban redevelopment can come into conflict with preserving heritage. In land-scarce Singapore, it is often inevitable.",
      "But effective urban planning is necessary to ensure that the nation\u2019s land use needs are met. This often requires our urban planners to redevelop existing plots of land to create space for new developments.",
      "What are the key considerations that determine which buildings or sites are to be conserved and which are to be redeveloped? How can our urban planners continue to ensure that Singapore\u2019s land use needs are fulfilled while at the same time retaining our heritage?",
      "This ongoing tension arose again with recent announcements that the Singapore Turf Club would cease its racing operations at Kranji. The 120ha Kranji site will be returned to the Government and redeveloped for housing and other needs.",
      "The move will free up much-needed land to address our urgent needs for more housing and commercial spaces.",
      "Considering the 180-year history of horse racing in Singapore, it is by no means an easy decision. But there are several factors that make this necessary.",
      "Closing the racecourse will support the development of a northern economic hub known as Woodlands Regional Centre, a plan that had already been articulated in the Housing Board\u2019s (HDB) 2017 Remaking Our Heartland programme.",
      "Such efforts to create regional business hubs are also part of the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)\u2019s \u201cLocal Hubs, Global Gateways\u201d strategy which aims to provide more commercial space outside the Central Business District (CBD).",
      "According to real estate consultancy Knight Frank, office rents in the CBD rose in the first quarter of 2023, driven by a combination of tight supply and strong demand.",
      "Singapore is also facing high demand for housing, which has translated into rising home prices and rents. In the first quarter of 2023, private home prices rose by 3.3 per cent while those of resale HDB flats rose by 0.9 per cent.",
      "As the space needs of Singapore\u2019s residents and its industries continue to grow, it will become necessary to redevelop existing sites to build more housing estates, innovation parks, satellite business districts and other projects.",
      "Besides driving urban redevelopment, the URA is also in charge of conserving historically significant buildings. According to the authority, conservation requires an appreciation and understanding of the architecture and structure of historic buildings, with the aim of retaining their inherent spirit and original ambience.",
      "Considerations for whether to conserve a building therefore involve the historical significance of the building, its architectural merit, as well as the original ambience of the building.",
      "The recent gazetting of Golden Mile Complex as a conserved building is a good case in point, given its post-independence modernist Brutalist style of architecture and popularity as a mixed-use development.",
      "However, given Singapore\u2019s land constraints and urgent land-use needs, it will be increasingly difficult to justify the conservation of buildings and facilities that occupy large plots of land.",
      "At 120ha, the Kranji Turf Club is almost four times the size of Dover Forest (33ha) and more than double the size of Keppel Club (48ha). Both of those sites have been slated for redevelopment into housing estates.",
      "While critics of the Dover Forest redevelopment suggested building flats on existing vacant sites, housing estates are in reality developed as an integrated whole.",
      "This means that housing estates need to include not only homes but also transport infrastructure, schools, markets, food outlets and medical facilities, requiring large plots of land rather than random pockets of space.",
      "The impetus for the Turf Club\u2019s closure is also related to a broader decline of interest in horse racing.",
      "According to a report from The Economist, horse racing viewership and attendance have been decreasing rapidly in the United States, pushed by declining interest in the sport as well as the proliferation of alternative gambling venues like casinos.",
      "In Singapore, horse racing average attendance has fallen from 6,000 per day in 2019 to current levels of 2,600 per day.",
      "Beyond its size, a racecourse is also a highly specialised facility that is designed to provide space for the care, training and racing of horses.",
      "At the Singapore Turf Club, there are multiple tracks for different race types and training purposes, racing and resting stables to accommodate horses, and an equine pool for training purposes. There are also a grandstand and carparks for accommodating spectators on race days.",
      "It will not be easy to convert such facilities for residential and commercial uses, nor will it be an optimal use of space and resources.",
      "It is possible that for the same reasons, other countries have considered closure of their horse racing tracks.",
      "In India, there is an ongoing debate about converting Mumbai\u2019s Mahalaxmi Race Course into a central park.",
      "In the United Kingdom, the Folkestone Racecourse in the county of Kent was closed in 2012 and recently approved for redevelopment into Otterpool Park Garden Town. This is a sustainability-focused town development that will provide housing, business premises and recreational facilities.",
      "In both instances, the demolishment (or proposed demolishment) of a racecourse frees up space for building homes and green spaces.",
      "In cases where large sports venues are conserved in the past, these often involved sports that continue to enjoy strong interest and viewership.",
      "Such venues include Berlin\u2019s Olympiastadion, which was a stadium built for the 1936 summer Olympics that is now used for international football matches.",
      "In Athens, there is the Panathenaic Stadium which was built around 330 BC. It has gone through refurbishments over the course of its history and remains in use as an Olympics venue.",
      "Given space constraints, Singapore will often face difficult trade-offs between urban redevelopment and conservation.",
      "This is further complicated by the fact that both are emotionally charged issues that matter a great deal to many.",
      "While it is important to conserve buildings and spaces that hold special meaning or memories for their users, there is also an urgent need to ensure sufficient housing and commercial spaces.",
      "Both are critical for the population."

    "question": "5. What role does public opinion play in the decision-making process of conserving or redeveloping a site?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "Public opinion plays a crucial role in the decision-making process of conserving or redeveloping a site. It is often considered as a key factor in the decision-making process as it reflects the values and preferences of the community. The public's opinion is an essential consideration as it provides valuable insights into the potential impact of the proposed development on the local community and the environment.",
      "Firstly, public opinion can influence the decision-making process by providing valuable feedback on the potential impact of the proposed development. The public's opinion can help identify the potential social, economic, and environmental impacts of the proposed development, which can then be used to inform the decision-making process. This feedback can help decision-makers make more informed decisions by considering the potential impact of the proposed development on the community and the environment.",
      "Secondly, public opinion can also influence the decision-making process by providing an indication of the level of community support for the proposed development. The level of community support can be an important consideration in the decision-making process, as it can impact the feasibility of the proposed development. If the proposed development does not have strong community support, it may be more difficult to obtain the necessary approvals and permits, making it less feasible to proceed with the development.",
      "Finally, public opinion can also influence the decision-making process by providing an indication of the level of public trust in the decision-making process. If the public perceives that the decision-making process is transparent and accountable, it can help build public trust in the decision-making process. This can be important in ensuring that the decision-making process is fair and reflects the values and preferences of the community.",
      "In conclusion, public opinion plays a critical role in the decision-making process of conserving or redeveloping a site. It provides valuable feedback on the potential impact of the proposed development, an indication of the level of community support, and an indication of the level of public trust in the decision-making process. As such, it is essential that decision-makers consider public opinion when making decisions about the conservation or redevelopment of a site."

      "A number of years ago, I remember excitedly anticipating a dinner reunion with a few of my teenage-era friends whom I had recently reconnected with. Back in the day, we were really close, sometimes egging each other on to defy our well-meaning teachers and then, when push came to shove, pulling all-nighters together to study for examinations.",
      "But when we finally met up again as adults, the chemistry had evaporated. I no longer found our shared jokes funny, and our updates about our respective life choices in the years since graduating struck me as mundane.",
      "The others likely felt the same way as none of us took the effort to initiate conversation or meet up again. It was to the best of my knowledge, a multi-way ghosting, with each of us abruptly cutting off communication without prior explanation.",
      "Having gone through the classic five stages of grief (denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance) when I was previously ghosted by an ex, I expected to feel at least a tinge of sadness at this unceremonious end to a once-cherished friendship circle. In fact, a recent study found that people often feel just as hurt at being ghosted by a friend as they do with a romantic partner.",
      "But surprisingly, I was unmoved by the entire experience. Instead, I felt a sense of relief that I had freed up time to focus on other things that I found more important without having to go through the whole rigmarole of explaining myself to someone else. They included work commitments and also nurturing new friendships with other people whom I felt a deeper connection with at that stage in life.",
      "Certainly, there is catharsis in wallowing in grief when losing a friend. Like with any other broken relationship, psychologists recommend taking time to express your emotions such as by journalling or indulging in a good cry, if you feel so inclined.",
      "Yet it is a reality that many friendships tend to fall by the wayside in our 30s and 40s. As Julie Beck, senior editor of the family section at The Atlantic observes, unlike the close-knit core friendships that those in their teens and 20s tend to forge and rely on, priorities change quite drastically later in life.",
      "Life happens. Marriage, childbirth and caring for elderly parents take centre stage, so it makes sense that platonic friendships, which are voluntary by nature, become less important.",
      "Certainly, we all probably have a personal story to share about friends who fell off the radar or stopped sending WhatsApp messages after they had kids. In this time-pressed world, who can blame them for not staying in contact, with other matters vying for their attention?",
      "This is why my preferred coping mechanism, which is also recommended by experts, is to reframe one\u2019s perspective. Instead of regarding a ghosted friendship as a deliberate rejection \u2013 which would be the case if a romantic partner did ghost you \u2013 simply tell yourself that life got in the way. This way, there is no reason to behave like a jilted lover. Rather, I prefer to move on quickly with no drama and focus my headspace on other priorities instead.",
      "Still, it is true that friendships are integral to one\u2019s happiness. In the book Friends: Understanding The Power Of Our Most Important Relationships, psychologist and author Robin Dunbar writes that the quality of our friendships has a huge influence on our happiness, health and even mortality.",
      "Dunbar, who famously came up with the hypothesis that each individual typically has the bandwidth for 150 friends, also posits that it is one\u2019s inner circle of about 15 closer friends who will be there to offer emotional, physical and financial help in times of need.",
      "So, if anything, it is even more essential to cultivate and perhaps curate these friendships so that they align with one\u2019s priorities and needs at any given stage in life. Even now in my 30s, I see no reason why I should stop making new friends and often take the effort to attend social or networking events to connect with like-minded people.",
      "Unsentimental as it may sound, I am also clear-eyed when friends drift apart. Likewise, I do not begrudge formerly close friends when they decide they would rather devote precious spare time to nurturing other friendship groups that they feel closer to.",
      "In these cases, ghosting actually turns out to be a useful method for letting friendships melt away gently into the good night. Its very ambiguity, when one \u2013 or both \u2013 parties simply stop communicating without a farewell note, actually leaves the door open for a reconciliation in the future.",
      "Hence, when a recent WhatsApp group I am a part of erupted in a flurry of ongoing messages about children and pre-school options, I resisted the urge to abruptly leave the chat even though I have very little interest in baby talk. There was no reason to make others uncomfortable with an unannounced exit when they were exchanging notes on things that mattered to them.",
      "Instead, I did some ghosting of my own by archiving the chat so that my phone will not be inundated with message alerts. It is likely I will stay out of this chat group for as long as the discussions are all about child-related travails.",
      "But some day in the future, should the chatter drift towards a topic that catches my interest, I will take it as my cue to pick up where I last left off with a nonchalant, \u201cHello! Remember me?\u201d",
      "After all, I never really did \u201cbreak up\u201d with them, I just drifted away for a while."

    "question": "1. What factors contribute to the evaporation of friendship chemistry between former teenage friends who reconnect as adults?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "There are several factors that can contribute to the evaporation of friendship chemistry between former teenage friends who reconnect as adults. One factor is the change in interests and priorities that often occurs as people age. As individuals grow and develop, their interests and values may shift, leading to differences in what they enjoy and prioritize. This can make it difficult to connect with old friends who no longer share the same interests or values.",
      "Another factor that can contribute to the decline of friendship chemistry is the passage of time and the changes that it brings. As people grow older, they may become more set in their ways and less willing to adapt to new situations or people. This can lead to a lack of compatibility and understanding between former friends, making it difficult to maintain a strong connection.",
      "Finally, the expectations and perceptions that individuals have of each other can also impact the evaporation of friendship chemistry. If one or both individuals have unrealistic expectations of the other, it can lead to disappointment and a breakdown in the friendship. Additionally, if one or both individuals have a negative perception of the other, it can be difficult to rebuild the trust and connection that was once there.",
      "Overall, the evaporation of friendship chemistry between former teenage friends who reconnect as adults can be due to a variety of factors, including changes in interests and priorities, the passage of time, and the expectations and perceptions that individuals have of each other."

    "question": "2. How does the experience of being ghosted by a friend compare to being ghosted by a romantic partner?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The experience of being ghosted by a friend can be quite different from being ghosted by a romantic partner. While both scenarios involve one person suddenly cutting off communication with the other, the emotional impact and the reasons behind the ghosting can vary significantly.",
      "Firstly, when a friend ghosts someone, it can be particularly jarring because friendships are often built on a foundation of trust and mutual support. The sudden disappearance of a friend can leave a person feeling confused, hurt, and abandoned. On the other hand, when a romantic partner ghosts someone, it may be more expected, given the nature of romantic relationships. While it can still be painful, the expectation of eventual heartbreak may make the situation feel less shocking.",
      "Secondly, the reasons behind ghosting can also differ. Friends may ghost each other due to a variety of reasons, such as growing apart, conflicting schedules, or simply losing interest in the friendship. In contrast, romantic partners may ghost each other due to a breakup, a lack of connection, or simply because they no longer want to be in the relationship.",
      "Finally, the social stigma surrounding ghosting can also differ. When a romantic partner ghosts someone, it is often seen as a negative behavior, and the person who was ghosted may receive sympathy and support from others. However, when a friend ghosts someone, it may be seen as less serious, and the person who was ghosted may be told to just move on or that it's not a big deal.",
      "In conclusion, while both being ghosted by a friend and a romantic partner can be painful experiences, the emotional impact, reasons behind the ghosting, and social stigma surrounding the behavior can vary significantly."

    "question": "3. What are some reasons why friendships tend to fall by the wayside in people's 30s and 40s?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "As people reach their 30s and 40s, they may find that their friendships begin to change or fall by the wayside for a variety of reasons. Some of these reasons include:",
      "1. Changing priorities: As people get older, their priorities shift. They may become more focused on their careers, families, and other responsibilities, which can take up a lot of their time and energy. This can make it more difficult to maintain close friendships, as they may not have as much time or energy to devote to these relationships.",
      "2. Geographic mobility: People in their 30s and 40s may move to new cities or countries for work or other reasons, which can make it more difficult to maintain friendships. It can be challenging to build new social networks and establish close relationships with people in a new location.",
      "3. Different interests and lifestyles: As people get older, their interests and lifestyles may change, which can make it more difficult to find common ground with friends. For example, someone who used to enjoy going out to bars and clubs may no longer enjoy this type of social activity, which can make it more difficult to connect with friends who still enjoy it.",
      "Overall, it is important for people to recognize that friendships can change over time and that it may require more effort to maintain close relationships as they get older. However, it is also important to remember that friendships are an important part of overall well-being and can provide support and companionship during all stages of life."

    "question": "4. How can reframing one's perspective help in coping with a ghosted friendship?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "Reframing one's perspective can be an effective way to cope with a ghosted friendship. When a friend suddenly stops communicating without any explanation, it can be difficult to understand why and may lead to feelings of confusion, hurt, and anger. However, reframing one's perspective can help to shift the focus from the negative feelings towards a more positive and understanding approach.",
      "One way to reframe one's perspective is to consider the possibility that the other person may be going through a difficult time and is unable to maintain the friendship at the moment. This can help to alleviate feelings of anger and frustration towards the other person and instead, foster empathy and understanding. It is important to remember that people's lives are complex and sometimes unpredictable, and it is not always possible to know what is going on in someone else's life.",
      "Another way to reframe one's perspective is to focus on one's own needs and priorities. Instead of dwelling on the loss of the friendship, one can use the time and energy to pursue other interests and relationships that align with their values and goals. This can help to shift the focus from the negative experience towards a more positive and empowering approach.",
      "In conclusion, reframing one's perspective can be a valuable tool for coping with a ghosted friendship. By considering alternative explanations and focusing on one's own needs and priorities, it is possible to shift from a negative to a more positive and understanding approach."

      "Karen Tee",
      "A number of years ago, I remember excitedly anticipating a dinner reunion with a few of my teenage-era friends whom I had recently reconnected with. Back in the day, we were really close, sometimes egging each other on to defy our well-meaning teachers and then, when push came to shove, pulling all-nighters together to study for examinations.",
      "But when we finally met up again as adults, the chemistry had evaporated. I no longer found our shared jokes funny, and our updates about our respective life choices in the years since graduating struck me as mundane.",
      "The others likely felt the same way as none of us took the effort to initiate conversation or meet up again. It was to the best of my knowledge, a multi-way ghosting, with each of us abruptly cutting off communication without prior explanation.",
      "Having gone through the classic five stages of grief (denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance) when I was previously ghosted by an ex, I expected to feel at least a tinge of sadness at this unceremonious end to a once-cherished friendship circle. In fact, a recent study found that people often feel just as hurt at being ghosted by a friend as they do with a romantic partner.",
      "But surprisingly, I was unmoved by the entire experience. Instead, I felt a sense of relief that I had freed up time to focus on other things that I found more important without having to go through the whole rigmarole of explaining myself to someone else. They included work commitments and also nurturing new friendships with other people whom I felt a deeper connection with at that stage in life.",
      "Certainly, there is catharsis in wallowing in grief when losing a friend. Like with any other broken relationship, psychologists recommend taking time to express your emotions such as by journalling or indulging in a good cry, if you feel so inclined.",
      "Yet it is a reality that many friendships tend to fall by the wayside in our 30s and 40s. As Julie Beck, senior editor of the family section at The Atlantic observes, unlike the close-knit core friendships that those in their teens and 20s tend to forge and rely on, priorities change quite drastically later in life.",
      "Life happens. Marriage, childbirth and caring for elderly parents take centre stage, so it makes sense that platonic friendships, which are voluntary by nature, become less important.",
      "Certainly, we all probably have a personal story to share about friends who fell off the radar or stopped sending WhatsApp messages after they had kids. In this time-pressed world, who can blame them for not staying in contact, with other matters vying for their attention?",
      "This is why my preferred coping mechanism, which is also recommended by experts, is to reframe one\u2019s perspective. Instead of regarding a ghosted friendship as a deliberate rejection \u2013 which would be the case if a romantic partner did ghost you \u2013 simply tell yourself that life got in the way. This way, there is no reason to behave like a jilted lover. Rather, I prefer to move on quickly with no drama and focus my headspace on other priorities instead.",
      "Still, it is true that friendships are integral to one\u2019s happiness. In the book Friends: Understanding The Power Of Our Most Important Relationships, psychologist and author Robin Dunbar writes that the quality of our friendships has a huge influence on our happiness, health and even mortality.",
      "Dunbar, who famously came up with the hypothesis that each individual typically has the bandwidth for 150 friends, also posits that it is one\u2019s inner circle of about 15 closer friends who will be there to offer emotional, physical and financial help in times of need.",
      "So, if anything, it is even more essential to cultivate and perhaps curate these friendships so that they align with one\u2019s priorities and needs at any given stage in life. Even now in my 30s, I see no reason why I should stop making new friends and often take the effort to attend social or networking events to connect with like-minded people.",
      "Unsentimental as it may sound, I am also clear-eyed when friends drift apart. Likewise, I do not begrudge formerly close friends when they decide they would rather devote precious spare time to nurturing other friendship groups that they feel closer to.",
      "In these cases, ghosting actually turns out to be a useful method for letting friendships melt away gently into the good night. Its very ambiguity, when one \u2013 or both \u2013 parties simply stop communicating without a farewell note, actually leaves the door open for a reconciliation in the future.",
      "Hence, when a recent WhatsApp group I am a part of erupted in a flurry of ongoing messages about children and pre-school options, I resisted the urge to abruptly leave the chat even though I have very little interest in baby talk. There was no reason to make others uncomfortable with an unannounced exit when they were exchanging notes on things that mattered to them.",
      "Instead, I did some ghosting of my own by archiving the chat so that my phone will not be inundated with message alerts. It is likely I will stay out of this chat group for as long as the discussions are all about child-related travails.",
      "But some day in the future, should the chatter drift towards a topic that catches my interest, I will take it as my cue to pick up where I last left off with a nonchalant, \u201cHello! Remember me?\u201d",
      "After all, I never really did \u201cbreak up\u201d with them, I just drifted away for a while."

      "It received almost no public attention. No wonder: Compared with the explosive controversies around cryptocurrencies, ChatGPT or Europe\u2019s new drive to break up Google\u2019s dominance of adtech, cloud computing \u2013 the public and private data storage and processing platforms run by Big Tech vendors \u2013 sounds achingly dull. So much so, that most Americans view Amazon as \u201cjust\u201d an online retail giant, even though its cloud division now generates significant revenues.",
      "But investors and financial services consumers alike should wake up. For, as a report from the Treasury\u2019s little-known Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee (FBIIC) declared earlier in 2023, regulators are getting nervous about the systemic financial risks emanating from the cloud. Indeed, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) suggested in 2022 \u2013 echoing work by European central banks \u2013 that \u201cbig tech interdependencies\u201d have become \u201ca key policy blind spot\u201d.",
      "Thus, the crucial question for the Treasury\u2019s cloud committee \u2013 which includes both regulators and bankers such as PNC Financial Services chief executive Bill Demchak \u2013 is whether this \u201cblind spot\u201d can be corrected before a not-so-boring accident erupts.",
      "There are at least three big issues to consider. The first is the speed of change in computing practices. The FBIIC report notes that more than 90 per cent of the members of the American Bankers Association are shifting activity on to the cloud, although more than 80 per cent say this is at an early stage. Since a separate survey suggests that two-thirds of banks expect at least 30 per cent of their activities to be cloud-based in the next three years, the FBIIC calculates that cloud usage will triple by then. The pattern in Europe seems similar.",
      "Second, financial regulators are ill-equipped to handle this explosive growth. They have always struggled to track information technology, since they have historically hired economists, not techies. But when finance companies were running their own IT operations, regulators did at least have a mandate to watch them.",
      "However, the dash into the cloud places more of that activity in the hands of Big Tech vendors, who have never faced serious central bank scrutiny before. Some observers, such as BIS head Agustin Carstens, think that an overhaul is overdue, in order to extend the \u201cregulatory perimeter\u201d. Maybe so.",
      "But America\u2019s tech giants will fiercely resist efforts to put them under the purview of central banks or other financial regulators \u2013 and the White House currently shows little stomach for that battle. That leaves the cloud in a financial regulatory grey zone. \u201cDue to the different legal authorities for each agency, no single agency can see across the many use cases and the network of dependencies on cloud services within the financial sector,\u201d the FBIIC report observed. In plain English: This is a fog.",
      "Third, insofar as data is available, it seems that there are big, and growing, concentration risks. This might sound surprising. After all, one reason for financial groups to dash into the cloud is to reduce their reliance on costly, and potentially vulnerable, in-house data centres. A distributed model is supposed to be more resilient.",
      "But one bitter irony of finance is that innovations which purport to reduce risk by distributing it can sometimes also concentrate it in new, surprising and half-hidden ways. Consider credit. Before 2008, it was assumed that innovations such as securitised mortgage products would promote resilience by spreading default risk beyond banks.",
      "But when the 2008 crisis hit, it emerged that numerous players had quietly hedged their activities with the same entity \u2013 AIG Financial Products (AIGFP). That created a hidden \u201csingle point of failure\u201d, or Spof, to use an engineering term, and generated shocks when AIGFP wobbled.",
      "Cloud computing echoes this so-called Spof issue, as Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu told the BIS earlier in 2023. Most notably \u2013 and as Brussels often complains \u2013 the cloud is dominated by an oligopoly of Amazon, Microsoft and Google. If one of those players suffered a big cyber attack, weather-linked disruption or simply went bankrupt, that would rock the system.",
      "Big Tech executives insist this will not occur. You would hope so. And these huge companies are almost certainly better at handling cyber risks than banks\u2019 in-house teams. But the 2020 SolarWinds hack on Microsoft\u2019s cloud systems showed that nobody is infallible. So did the recent Ion saga and Capita data breach.",
      "And even without cyber risks, the commercial power wielded by this oligopoly is unnerving, particularly for Europeans. Indeed, Britain\u2019s Office of Communications, or Ofcom, has launched an investigation.",
      "So all eyes are now on the Treasury\u2019s Cloud Committee. Sadly, there are no easy solutions; or not unless the US government does something it seems unwilling or unable to contemplate \u2013 namely, break up Big Tech and/or impose tight government controls. But if nothing else, the issue shows that artificial intelligence is not the only tech topic that matters now. Maybe that Cloud Committee should ask ChatGPT how to defuse the Spof threat. The answer would probably be easier for Big Tech to swallow than asking Brussels. FINANCIAL TIMES"

    "question": "3. What are the three big issues that the Treasury's cloud committee needs to consider?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The Treasury's cloud committee needs to consider three big issues when implementing a cloud strategy: data security, vendor management, and cost optimization.",
      "Firstly, data security is a critical issue that needs to be addressed. Cloud computing offers many benefits, but it also introduces new security challenges. The Treasury's cloud committee needs to ensure that appropriate security measures are in place to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access. This includes implementing strong authentication and access controls, encrypting data in transit and at rest, and regularly monitoring and auditing security logs.",
      "Secondly, vendor management is another important issue that the Treasury's cloud committee needs to consider. When implementing a cloud strategy, the committee needs to ensure that the selected cloud service provider has the necessary expertise, experience, and resources to meet the Treasury's requirements. This includes evaluating the provider's security certifications, track record, and customer references. The committee also needs to establish clear service level agreements (SLAs) and contract terms to ensure that the provider meets its obligations.",
      "Finally, cost optimization is a key issue that the Treasury's cloud committee needs to consider. Cloud computing can offer significant cost savings, but it can also be expensive if not managed properly. The committee needs to ensure that the cloud strategy is designed to optimize costs while still meeting the Treasury's requirements. This includes selecting the appropriate cloud service model, optimizing resource utilization, and implementing cost management tools and policies.",
      "In conclusion, the Treasury's cloud committee needs to consider three big issues when implementing a cloud strategy: data security, vendor management, and cost optimization. By addressing these issues, the committee can ensure that the cloud strategy is implemented successfully and delivers the desired benefits to the Treasury."

    "question": "4. How does the concentration of cloud computing services in a few big tech vendors create a potential risk for the financial sector?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The concentration of cloud computing services in a few big tech vendors creates a potential risk for the financial sector in several ways. Firstly, it leads to a lack of competition in the market, which can result in higher prices and less innovation. This is because the big tech vendors have a significant market share, and they can dictate the terms and conditions of their services. As a result, financial institutions may have limited options when it comes to choosing a cloud service provider, which can lead to higher costs and less flexibility.",
      "Secondly, the concentration of cloud computing services in a few big tech vendors can also lead to a single point of failure. If a cloud service provider experiences a security breach or a system failure, it can affect multiple financial institutions that rely on their services. This can lead to significant financial losses, reputational damage, and regulatory penalties.",
      "Finally, the concentration of cloud computing services in a few big tech vendors can also create a potential risk of vendor lock-in. Financial institutions may become dependent on the services provided by a particular cloud service provider, which can make it difficult for them to switch to a different provider in the future. This can limit their ability to negotiate better terms and conditions, and it can also limit their ability to innovate and adopt new technologies.",
      "In conclusion, the concentration of cloud computing services in a few big tech vendors creates a potential risk for the financial sector in several ways. It can lead to a lack of competition, a single point of failure, and vendor lock-in. To mitigate these risks, financial institutions should consider diversifying their cloud service providers and adopting a multi-cloud strategy."

Indeed, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) suggested in 2022 \u2013 echoing work by European central banks \u2013 that \u201cbig tech interdependencies\u201d have become \u201ca key policy blind spot\u201d.",
      "Thus, the crucial question for the Treasury\u2019s cloud committee \u2013 which includes both regulators and bankers such as PNC Financial Services chief executive Bill Demchak \u2013 is whether this \u201cblind spot\u201d can be corrected before a not-so-boring accident erupts.",
      "There are at least three big issues to consider. The first is the speed of change in computing practices. The FBIIC report notes that more than 90 per cent of the members of the American Bankers Association are shifting activity on to the cloud, although more than 80 per cent say this is at an early stage. Since a separate survey suggests that two-thirds of banks expect at least 30 per cent of their activities to be cloud-based in the next three years, the FBIIC calculates that cloud usage will triple by then. The pattern in Europe seems similar.",
      "Second, financial regulators are ill-equipped to handle this explosive growth. They have always struggled to track information technology, since they have historically hired economists, not techies. But when finance companies were running their own IT operations, regulators did at least have a mandate to watch them.",
      "However, the dash into the cloud places more of that activity in the hands of Big Tech vendors, who have never faced serious central bank scrutiny before. Some observers, such as BIS head Agustin Carstens, think that an overhaul is overdue, in order to extend the \u201cregulatory perimeter\u201d. Maybe so.",
      "But America\u2019s tech giants will fiercely resist efforts to put them under the purview of central banks or other financial regulators \u2013 and the White House currently shows little stomach for that battle. That leaves the cloud in a financial regulatory grey zone. \u201cDue to the different legal authorities for each agency, no single agency can see across the many use cases and the network of dependencies on cloud services within the financial sector,\u201d the FBIIC report observed. In plain English: This is a fog.",
      "Third, insofar as data is available, it seems that there are big, and growing, concentration risks. This might sound surprising. After all, one reason for financial groups to dash into the cloud is to reduce their reliance on costly, and potentially vulnerable, in-house data centres. A distributed model is supposed to be more resilient.",
      "But one bitter irony of finance is that innovations which purport to reduce risk by distributing it can sometimes also concentrate it in new, surprising and half-hidden ways. Consider credit. Before 2008, it was assumed that innovations such as securitised mortgage products would promote resilience by spreading default risk beyond banks.",
      "But when the 2008 crisis hit, it emerged that numerous players had quietly hedged their activities with the same entity \u2013 AIG Financial Products (AIGFP). That created a hidden \u201csingle point of failure\u201d, or Spof, to use an engineering term, and generated shocks when AIGFP wobbled.",
      "Cloud computing echoes this so-called Spof issue, as Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu told the BIS earlier in 2023. Most notably \u2013 and as Brussels often complains \u2013 the cloud is dominated by an oligopoly of Amazon, Microsoft and Google. If one of those players suffered a big cyber attack, weather-linked disruption or simply went bankrupt, that would rock the system.",
      "Big Tech executives insist this will not occur. You would hope so. And these huge companies are almost certainly better at handling cyber risks than banks\u2019 in-house teams. But the 2020 SolarWinds hack on Microsoft\u2019s cloud systems showed that nobody is infallible. So did the recent Ion saga and Capita data breach.",
      "And even without cyber risks, the commercial power wielded by this oligopoly is unnerving, particularly for Europeans. Indeed, Britain\u2019s Office of Communications, or Ofcom, has launched an investigation.",
      "So all eyes are now on the Treasury\u2019s Cloud Committee. Sadly, there are no easy solutions; or not unless the US government does something it seems unwilling or unable to contemplate \u2013 namely, break up Big Tech and/or impose tight government controls. But if nothing else, the issue shows that artificial intelligence is not the only tech topic that matters now. Maybe that Cloud Committee should ask ChatGPT how to defuse the Spof threat. The answer would probably be easier for Big Tech to swallow than asking Brussels. FINANCIAL TIMES"

    "question": "5. What is the \"Spof\" issue, and how does it relate to the cloud computing industry?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The \"Spof\" issue in the cloud computing industry refers to the Single Point of Failure. It occurs when a cloud service provider has a single point of failure in its infrastructure that can cause a significant disruption to its services. This can happen due to hardware failure, network outage, or other issues that can lead to the unavailability of services. The Spof issue can have serious consequences for businesses that rely on cloud services, as it can result in data loss, revenue loss, and damage to the company's reputation.",
      "To mitigate the Spof issue, cloud service providers must implement redundant systems and failover mechanisms to ensure that services can continue to operate even in the event of a failure. For example, cloud providers may use load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple servers, or they may implement automatic failover mechanisms that can switch to backup systems in the event of a failure.",
      "Another way to address the Spof issue is to use multiple cloud providers. This is known as multi-cloud strategy, which allows businesses to spread their workloads across multiple providers, reducing the risk of a single point of failure. This approach also provides businesses with more flexibility and choice, as they can select the best provider for each workload based on factors such as cost, performance, and security.",
      "In conclusion, the Spof issue is a critical concern for businesses that rely on cloud services. To mitigate this issue, cloud providers must implement redundant systems and failover mechanisms, and businesses can use multi-cloud strategies to spread their workloads across multiple providers. By taking these steps, businesses can ensure that their cloud services are reliable and resilient, and that they can continue to operate even in the event of a failure."

Firstly, one of the major challenges he will face is the ongoing debate over the role and effectiveness of the World Bank. Critics argue that the institution has been slow to adapt to the changing global landscape and that it has failed to adequately address issues such as poverty, inequality, and climate change. As such, Mr. Banga will need to address these concerns and demonstrate the bank's commitment to promoting sustainable development and reducing poverty.",

That is nearly as much as what the United States spent on public schools and almost twice the cost of returns in 2020.

      "UPS transports those items to the retailer\u2019s warehouses dedicated to processing returns. This step of the process costs the retailer money \u2013 66 per cent of the cost of a US$50 item by one estimate \u2013 and emits carbon dioxide as trucks and planes carry items hundreds of kilometres. The plastic, paper or cardboard from the return package becomes waste.",
      "Processing a return takes two to three times longer than initially shipping the item \u2013 it has to be unpacked, inspected, repacked and rerouted. That adds more to the cost to the company, especially in a tight labour market. Workers have to manually unpack the items, inspect them and, based on the return reason, decide what will happen next.",

      "Once another consumer orders the shirt, it will be ready to be packed and shipped.",
      "In-store returns can significantly cut warehouse and transportation costs, but driving to a bricks-and-mortar store might not be convenient for the consumer. Only about a quarter of online purchases are returned in person to the store.",
      "If the item is defective, like the electric toothbrush in our example, the warehouse worker might send it back to the manufacturer for fixing and refurbishing. It would be repackaged and loaded on a truck and possibly a plane to be sent to the manufacturer, leading to more carbon dioxide emissions.",
      "If the electric toothbrush can be repaired, the refurbished product is ready to be sold into the consumer market again \u2013 often at a lower price.",
      "Refurbishing returned products helps to achieve a closed-loop supply chain where products are reused rather than disposed of as waste, making the process more sustainable than buying a new item.",

That changed after Amazon began offering free returns and providing easy-to-use drop-off locations at UPS or Kohl\u2019s stores. Other retailers followed suit to compete, with many seeing free returns as a way to keep shoppers coming back.",
      "But that pendulum may be starting to swing back. The percentage of retailers charging to ship returns increased from 33 per cent to 41 per cent in 2022.",
      "Retailers are trying several other techniques to lower the return rate, waste and losses, which ultimately come back to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "Some retailers have shortened the return window, limited frequent returns, or stopped offering free returns.",

    "question": "1. What are the environmental consequences of product returns in the retail industry?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The environmental consequences of product returns in the retail industry are significant and multifaceted. One major impact is the increased waste generated by the return process. When customers return products, they often must be packaged up and shipped back to the retailer, resulting in a significant amount of packaging waste. Additionally, products that are returned in poor condition may be difficult to resell or may be destined for landfill. This can lead to a cycle of overproduction and waste, as manufacturers may produce more products than can be sold in order to account for the expected return rate.",
      "Another environmental consequence of product returns is the energy and resources used in the transportation of returned products. The shipping and handling of returned products requires energy and contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, the increased volume of returned products can also put a strain on the resources of retailers and manufacturers, as they must divert resources to handle and process the returns.",
      "Finally, the environmental consequences of product returns in the retail industry can also extend to the extraction of raw materials used in the production of the products. For example, the mining of materials such as gold and copper for electronic products can have significant environmental impacts, including habitat destruction, pollution, and human rights abuses. The increased volume of returns can contribute to a higher demand for these materials, leading to further environmental impacts.",
      "In conclusion, the environmental consequences of product returns in the retail industry are significant and multifaceted. They include increased waste and packaging, energy and resource use in transportation, and environmental impacts from the extraction of raw materials. It is important for retailers and manufacturers to consider these consequences and work towards reducing the environmental impact of product returns."

This step of the process costs the retailer money \u2013 66 per cent of the cost of a US$50 item by one estimate \u2013 and emits carbon dioxide as trucks and planes carry items hundreds of kilometres. The plastic, paper or cardboard from the return package becomes waste.",
      "Processing a return takes two to three times longer than initially shipping the item \u2013 it has to be unpacked, inspected, repacked and rerouted.

      "1. Free returns policies have a significant impact on consumers as they provide them with the convenience of being able to return products easily and without any hassle. This is particularly beneficial for consumers who may have purchased an item that does not fit or meet their expectations. The ability to return a product with ease reduces the risk associated with online shopping and increases consumer confidence in the retailer.",
      "2. Free returns policies also benefit retailers as they can lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty. By offering a hassle-free return process, retailers demonstrate their commitment to customer satisfaction, which can lead to repeat business and positive word-of-mouth marketing. Additionally, by accepting returns, retailers can gain valuable insights into customer preferences and product performance, which can be used to improve their offerings.",
      "3. However, free returns policies can also have a negative impact on retailers, particularly if they lead to a high rate of returns. This can result in increased costs for the retailer, including shipping and handling fees, as well as the cost of processing the return. In some cases, retailers may also incur additional costs if the product is damaged or used upon return. As such, retailers need to carefully consider the potential impact of a free returns policy on their bottom line before implementing it."

These mental health conditions can lead to social isolation, as individuals may withdraw from social activities and relationships due to feelings of shame, guilt, and low self-esteem. This can result in a decreased sense of purpose and meaning in life, which can further exacerbate symptoms of anxiety and depression.",

The study also highlights the need for increased access to mental health services in Singapore, as many individuals with anxiety and depression symptoms may not seek treatment due to stigma, lack of awareness, or financial barriers.

    "question": "1. What are the reasons behind the initial excitement about carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a solution for decarbonizing power systems?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) was initially seen as a promising solution for decarbonizing power systems due to several reasons. Firstly, CCS technology allows for the capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from power plants and industrial processes, preventing them from entering the atmosphere and contributing to climate change. This made CCS an attractive option for countries looking to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions while still maintaining a reliable energy supply.",
      "Secondly, CCS was seen as a way to extend the life of fossil fuel power plants, which are often a significant source of electricity generation. By capturing and storing the CO2 emissions, these power plants could continue to operate while still meeting emissions targets.",
      "Finally, CCS was seen as a way to support the transition to a low-carbon economy. By providing a means of capturing and storing CO2, CCS could facilitate the continued use of fossil fuels while supporting the development of low-carbon technologies such as renewable energy and electric vehicles.",
      "Overall, the initial excitement around CCS was driven by its potential to address climate change while still supporting the energy needs of society. However, the technology has faced significant challenges in terms of cost, scalability, and public acceptance, leading to a more measured approach to its deployment in recent years."

    "question": "2. What factors contributed to the decline of CCS in favor of renewable energy sources like wind and solar power?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The decline of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) in favor of renewable energy sources like wind and solar power can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the high cost of CCS technology has been a significant barrier to its widespread adoption. CCS requires additional infrastructure and equipment to capture and store CO2 emissions, which adds to the overall cost of energy production. In contrast, renewable energy sources like wind and solar power have seen significant cost reductions in recent years, making them more competitive in the energy market.",
      "Secondly, the shift towards renewable energy sources has been driven by concerns over climate change and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While CCS can help to reduce emissions from fossil fuel-based power generation, it does not address the root cause of the problem, which is the continued use of fossil fuels. Renewable energy sources, on the other hand, produce no emissions during operation and are therefore seen as a more sustainable solution to the problem of climate change.",
      "Finally, government policies and incentives have played a role in the decline of CCS in favor of renewable energy sources. Many governments have implemented policies to support the development and deployment of renewable energy, such as feed-in tariffs and renewable portfolio standards. In contrast, CCS has received less support, with many governments focusing on reducing emissions through energy efficiency measures and other low-carbon technologies.",
      "In conclusion, the decline of CCS in favor of renewable energy sources like wind and solar power can be attributed to a combination of factors, including high costs, the need for a sustainable solution to climate change, and government policies and incentives. While CCS has the potential to play a role in reducing emissions from energy production, renewable energy sources are currently seen as a more viable and sustainable solution."

      "For those who have followed the energy transition over the past few decades, there is one technology that is treated as much as a punchline as a serious industry: Carbon capture and storage, or CCS.",
      "A decade or so ago, many still thought it was the best hope for decarbonising the world\u2019s power systems. CCS was \u201cthe Google and Intel of the energy world\u201d, the Atlantic magazine declared in a 2010 cover story that predicted solar and wind would never get above 10 per cent of power supply.",
      "In the following decade, it was renewables that boomed while CCS went bust. Wind and solar accounted for 39 per cent of generation in Germany in the first quarter of 2023 and will hit 50 per cent over the full year in Spain. Meanwhile, only a handful of demonstration CCS plants went into operation \u2013 and one of the biggest was switched off in 2021 as oil prices plummeted, since it had been able to make money only from the decidedly dirty business of driving carbon dioxide into depleted oil wells to force out fresh crude.",
      "There are signs that CCS may be about to get the last laugh, though. In Britain, the government has promised as much as \u00a320 billion (S$33.9 billion) in spending to kick-start the sector. A tender to scope out sites that could store as much as 10 per cent of the country\u2019s emissions in old North Sea oilfields closed comfortably oversubscribed in May. In the Gulf of Mexico, ExxonMobil has spent about US$25 million (S$33.6 million) in two recent rounds bidding for nearly 170 blocks of depleted offshore acreage that might be able to store carbon from a planned hub in Houston, Texas. The world\u2019s first CCS project at a cement plant is slated to start in 2024 at a Heidelberg Materials facility in Norway.",
      "What\u2019s different now? In essence, a business that was always viable technologically has finally found an economic rationale. The problem with CCS was never that it did not work: Norway\u2019s Sleipner carbon capture project has been quietly pumping about 1 million tonnes annually under the North Sea for nearly 20 years since it was built to evade a 1991 carbon tax. Elsewhere in the world, however, there was no way to get paid.",
      "That has changed with the US Inflation Reduction Act and the surging value of the European Union\u2019s carbon permits. CCS does not really become viable anywhere south of US$70 a metric tonne, and until about 18 months ago the only countries putting a price on carbon at that level were in Scandinavia and the Alps.",
      "Since the start of 2022, however, European carbon has averaged US$89 a tonne, while the Biden administration\u2019s climate Bill has introduced an US$85/tonne tax credit for CCS. Roughly a third of the world economy has suddenly priced carbon dioxide (CO2) at a level where, in theory, there should be good money in locking it up underground.",
      "All the hype from the 2000s has cast a long shadow. CCS is still seen by many energy specialists as a pipe dream at best, and at worst a mendacious attempt to rebrand fossil fuels without doing the hard work of decarbonisation. The main end-use for which it was pitched a decade ago \u2013 power generation \u2013 has also been invalidated by the slumping costs of renewable power.",
      "Even if you exclude electricity, however, there is a big slice of industry where CCS could yet be crucial. Power generation accounts for about 40 per cent of the world\u2019s CO2 emissions, but another fifth comes from steel, cement and chemicals \u2013 and renewables are not well-suited to abating that pollution. Until technologies such as green steel and green hydrogen get up to speed and someone invents a viable way of making zero-carbon cement, we could use a functioning CCS sector to keep that CO2 out of the atmosphere.",
      "CCS has another benefit, too. The developed world\u2019s shift to a more aggressive decarbonisation pathway risks leaving many emerging economies stranded. Falling fossil fuel demand will kill off one of their main raw materials export industries, while carbon border taxes threaten future manufacturing sectors. A global carbon trade offers a solution to that problem, giving nations with the right geology the ability to make money from sequestering other people\u2019s carbon.",
      "In places, the carbon content of a barrel of oil is already worth more than the fuel. EU pricing for the emissions from heavy Canadian crude is currently about 25 per cent above the cost of the crude itself. That\u2019s potentially a revenue stream that oil-dependent nations in Africa and the Middle East could monetise.",
      "Governments should do everything they can to foster this trend \u2013 and to encourage China, attempting a crackdown on the heavy industries that account for more than half of its pollution, to lift its own anaemic US$8.24 a tonne carbon price to similar paradigm-changing levels.",

    "question": "4. What industries could benefit from the implementation of a functioning CCS sector, and how would this help in reducing carbon emissions?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "1. The implementation of a functioning Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) sector could benefit various industries, particularly those that emit high levels of carbon dioxide. These industries include power generation, cement production, and chemical manufacturing. CCS technology can capture carbon dioxide emissions from these industries and store them underground, preventing them from entering the atmosphere and contributing to climate change. This would help in reducing carbon emissions and achieving the goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions set by governments and international organizations.",
      "2. The implementation of CCS technology can also benefit the energy sector by enabling the use of fossil fuels in a more sustainable way. CCS technology can be used to capture carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel power plants, which can then be stored underground. This would allow for the continued use of fossil fuels while reducing carbon emissions, providing a bridge to a low-carbon future. Additionally, CCS technology can also be used to enhance oil recovery, increasing the amount of oil that can be extracted from existing reservoirs.",
      "3. The implementation of a functioning CCS sector would also have economic benefits. The development and deployment of CCS technology can create new jobs and industries, particularly in regions with significant carbon emissions from industrial sources. Additionally, CCS technology can provide a competitive advantage for industries that use it, as it can reduce costs associated with carbon emissions and improve their environmental reputation. This can help to drive innovation and investment in the CCS sector, leading to further technological advancements and cost reductions over time."

Firstly, it demonstrates the changing political dynamics in the country, as Umno, which was previously the dominant party in Malaysia, seeks to form alliances with other parties to gain power. This shows that the political landscape is becoming more competitive and diverse, with different parties and coalitions vying for power.",
      "Secondly, the reconciliation between Umno and Mr. Anwar highlights the ongoing struggle for power within the country's political elite. The move could be seen as an attempt by Umno to regain its position as the dominant party in Malaysia, while Mr. Anwar seeks to strengthen his own political position and gain more influence in the country's politics.",
      "Finally, the reconciliation between Umno and Mr. Anwar reflects the ongoing challenges facing Malaysia's political landscape, including issues such as corruption, race-based politics, and economic inequality. The move could be seen as an attempt to address some of these challenges, but it remains to be seen whether it will be effective in bringing about meaningful change in the country's politics."

    "question": "4. How does the anti-hopping law affect the ability of former Umno members to join the opposition coalition?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The Anti-Hopping Law is a legislation passed by the government of Malaysia that restricts elected representatives from switching political parties within a certain period before a general election. The law aims to prevent political instability and encourage political stability by preventing party hopping.",
      "The law has affected the ability of former Umno members to join the opposition coalition as it imposes a ban on elected representatives from switching parties within a certain period before a general election. This means that if a former Umno member wishes to join the opposition coalition, they would have to give up their seat in parliament, which could result in a by-election. This could be seen as a disincentive for former Umno members to join the opposition coalition as it would require them to risk losing their seat in parliament.",
      "Additionally, the Anti-Hopping Law has created a sense of uncertainty among politicians as they may not know if they will be able to switch parties in the future. This could discourage potential politicians from joining Umno or other political parties as they may not want to risk being unable to switch parties in the future. This could ultimately lead to a lack of diversity in the political landscape as potential politicians may be deterred from entering politics altogether.",
      "In conclusion, the Anti-Hopping Law has affected the ability of former Umno members to join the opposition coalition by imposing a ban on party hopping and creating a sense of uncertainty among politicians. This could result in a lack of diversity in the political landscape and discourage potential politicians from entering politics."

      "The National Youth Council is encouraging more young Singaporeans to take the opportunity to travel abroad following the reopening of international borders after the coronavirus pandemic. More than 20 per cent of the 7,000 regional opportunities to go abroad in 2023 have been availed of so far, with the rest scheduled for the second half of the year. This figure is up from 4,800 in 2019. Travel opportunities to South-east Asia, China and India offered by the council\u2019s programmes highlight the importance of Asia in the mental landscape of young Singaporeans.",
      "As a global city, Singapore has been keenly interested in developing its economic connections with the world lying outside its immediate hinterland. This approach was necessary particularly when the Republic\u2019s departure from Malaysia required it to find sources of investment and to reach markets that would reduce its dependence on a traditional economic partner that had turned hostile towards it once it became independent. Singapore\u2019s consequent closeness to North America and Europe resulted in its citizens developing, quite naturally, a Western-centric view of their economic place in the world. The young imbibed attitudes inherited from the experiences and expectations of their parents.",
      "However, the end of the Cold War and the rise of Asia have overturned many global calculations for quite a while. Now, what is required is the ability of the young here to see, understand and accept their neighbours without the use of what an eminent Singaporean educationist calls a \u201cdistorted deficit lens\u201d. That is, even Singapore\u2019s unquestionable success as a city-state should not produce myopic insularity among its young and a resulting sense of regional countries as laggards which need help and support. Such stereotypes belong to a vanished past. The economic successes of China and India should alert Singapore\u2019s tertiary students to the possibilities of South-east Asia as well. Vietnam and Indonesia are among the rising stars of this region. To know them would be to understand what Singapore should do to position itself well in the Asian future, without which globalisation would be hobbled, to the detriment of Singapore ultimately.",
      "Tertiary students here should venture out of their comfort zone to discover and explore their neighbours, less to see how they might or might not fit into Singapore\u2019s formula for survival and success, and more to seek insights into how this country could be a part of Asia\u2019s evolving developmental paradigms. It is not that the Singapore Model is wrong: it is that it needs to keep pace with ways of life, thinking and choice in Asia that are influencing the direction of globalisation. Singapore must never become prisoner to a mental bubble."

Singaporean tertiary students can do this by reading literature and scholarship from non-Western perspectives and engaging in discussions with people from different cultural backgrounds.",
      "2. Singaporean tertiary students can also participate in study abroad programs and exchange programs that offer opportunities to experience different cultures and ways of life. By immersing themselves in different cultural contexts, students can gain a more nuanced understanding of Asia's role in globalization and develop a more critical perspective on their own cultural biases.",
      "3. Finally, Singaporean tertiary students can engage in community service and volunteer work that involves working with diverse communities. Through these experiences, students can gain a deeper appreciation of the complexities of globalization and the ways in which different cultures and societies are interconnected.

By learning about the history, culture, and politics of different countries in the region, students can gain a deeper understanding of the complexities of the region and develop a more nuanced perspective on issues that affect the region as a whole. This can also lead to opportunities for collaboration and knowledge-sharing with scholars and researchers from other countries in the region.",

      "Both Britain and America flatter themselves that their political systems are admired all over the world. Britain is the home to the \u201cmother of Parliaments\u201d. The United States is the \u201cleader of the free world\u201d. The two countries see themselves as mature democracies; models that other nations can emulate.",
      "But the last few years have shaken that Anglo-American complacency. Britain has suffered the agonies of Brexit and gone through four prime ministers in as many years. The US saw Congress stormed on Jan 6, 2021, in what was essentially an attempted coup by an outgoing president.",
      "The troubles of democracy have deep roots in both countries. But they are also closely associated with two individuals \u2013 Donald Trump and Mr Boris Johnson.",
      "Trump and Mr Johnson have championed a similar style of politics. Both have built up cults of personality, convincing their most devoted followers that they are men of destiny. Both are nostalgic nationalists, who have promised to restore their country\u2019s greatness. Both claim to be representatives of the people against a self-interested elite.",
      "Because they regard themselves as unique, indispensable figures, Mr Johnson and Trump have felt free to break the laws and conventions that normally bind political leaders. When challenged or held to account, both have claimed to be the victims of a deep state conspiracy.",
      "This is a style of politics that is well known all over the world. The charismatic strongman leader \u2013 paranoid, power hungry, unaccountable and surrounded by sycophants \u2013 is a sadly familiar figure. Just look at the ranting speeches of Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who claims to see conspiracies against him everywhere.",
      "For Mr Erdogan, the law is a weapon to be used against his political opponents, rather than something that he himself must obey. The same is true for Mr Vladimir Putin in Russia. In Turkey and Russia alike, the president\u2019s political opponents frequently end up in prison, while the leaders themselves are never held to account, despite the accusations of corruption and abuse of power that swirl around them.",
      "It is these questions of the rule of law and accountability that are central to the latest episodes of the Trump and Johnson soap operas.",
      "The former US president has just been indicted for mishandling classified documents. The former British prime minister has just resigned from the House of Commons after a committee accused him of lying to Parliament about breaking the law during the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "The reactions of Trump and Mr Johnson to their current travails are strikingly similar. They have followed the same paranoid and self-interested narrative, claiming that they are the victims of a political conspiracy and that the system is rigged against them and their followers.",
      "Such assertions strike at the heart of the US and British images of themselves as mature democracies in which the rule of law is not a charade but a reality. The bleak suggestion is that governance in Washington and London is little different from Moscow or Ankara.",
      "Both Trump and Mr Johnson are fabulists for whom the truth is simply what is politically or personally convenient at the time. That style of politics is becoming more common and threatening. We live in a social media age in which \u201calternative facts\u201d (in the words of a former Trump aide) can always be concocted, if the real facts prove inconvenient.",
      "Any functioning, law-governed democracy must be based on the idea that there is such a thing as truth and that it can be established in a court or by a parliamentary committee. Crucially, that is very different from saying that Trump or Mr Johnson must be found guilty. They have every right to protest their innocence. If either could prove it before a court of law or a parliamentary committee, that would be just as much a sign of democracy in action as a guilty verdict.",
      "The courts, political parties and the voters all have a role to play in making sure that the rule of law and democracy function properly. Here, the outlook looks more promising in Britain than in the US.",
      "The parliamentary committee that found against Mr Johnson contains a majority of members of his own party. By contrast, very few Republicans in Congress have turned against Trump, whatever their private misgivings.

    "question": "1. What are the common characteristics of the political systems in Britain and America, as portrayed in the article?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "1. One common characteristic of the political systems in Britain and America, as portrayed in the article, is the existence of a constitution. Both countries have a written constitution that serves as the foundation of their political systems and provides a framework for the exercise of power. The constitution in both countries is considered a key document that sets out the principles and rules that govern the relationship between the government and the people.",
      "2. Another characteristic of the political systems in Britain and America is the use of a parliamentary system. Both countries have a parliamentary system, which is characterized by the election of representatives by the people to a parliament or congress, and the formation of a government by the party or coalition that holds the majority of seats in the parliament or congress. The government is then responsible to the parliament or congress and can be removed through a vote of no confidence.",
      "3. A third characteristic of the political systems in Britain and America is the existence of a system of checks and balances. Both countries have a system of checks and balances, which is designed to prevent the concentration of power in any one branch of government. In Britain, the system of checks and balances is based on the separation of powers between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government. In America, the system of checks and balances is based on the separation of powers between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government, as well as the checks and balances between the federal government and the states."

Donald Trump's presidency was marked by divisive rhetoric and controversial policies, such as his travel ban on citizens of several Muslim-majority countries and his efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act.

Just look at the ranting speeches of Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who claims to see conspiracies against him everywhere.",
      "For Mr Erdogan, the law is a weapon to be used against his political opponents, rather than something that he himself must obey. The same is true for Mr Vladimir Putin in Russia. In Turkey and Russia alike, the president\u2019s political opponents frequently end up in prison, while the leaders themselves are never held to account, despite the accusations of corruption and abuse of power that swirl around them.",
      "It is these questions of the rule of law and accountability that are central to the latest episodes of the Trump and Johnson soap operas.",
      "The former US president has just been indicted for mishandling classified documents. The former British prime minister has just resigned from the House of Commons after a committee accused him of lying to Parliament about breaking the law during the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "The reactions of Trump and Mr Johnson to their current travails are strikingly similar. They have followed the same paranoid and self-interested narrative, claiming that they are the victims of a political conspiracy and that the system is rigged against them and their followers.",
      "Such assertions strike at the heart of the US and British images of themselves as mature democracies in which the rule of law is not a charade but a reality. The bleak suggestion is that governance in Washington and London is little different from Moscow or Ankara.",
      "Both Trump and Mr Johnson are fabulists for whom the truth is simply what is politically or personally convenient at the time. That style of politics is becoming more common and threatening. We live in a social media age in which \u201calternative facts\u201d (in the words of a former Trump aide) can always be concocted, if the real facts prove inconvenient.",
      "Any functioning, law-governed democracy must be based on the idea that there is such a thing as truth and that it can be established in a court or by a parliamentary committee. Crucially, that is very different from saying that Trump or Mr Johnson must be found guilty. They have every right to protest their innocence. If either could prove it before a court of law or a parliamentary committee, that would be just as much a sign of democracy in action as a guilty verdict.",
      "The courts, political parties and the voters all have a role to play in making sure that the rule of law and democracy function properly. Here, the outlook looks more promising in Britain than in the US.",
      "The parliamentary committee that found against Mr Johnson contains a majority of members of his own party. By contrast, very few Republicans in Congress have turned against Trump, whatever their private misgivings. The judge who will rule on the latest Trump indictment in Florida was appointed by the former president. She, too, must be seen to behave impartially.",
      "If the courts do their job in an obviously fair and professional manner, it is more likely that their verdicts will command the respect of voters. A majority of voters, like the courts, also have to be able to resist conspiracy theories and \u201calternative\u201d facts. That seems far from a sure thing in the US, where Trump remains the favourite for the Republican nomination and is neck and neck with President Joe Biden in the polls for an election.",
      "The cases of Trump and Mr Johnson will matter far beyond the shores of the US and Britain. If they are properly handled, it will send a vital message to people battling autocracies all over the world. America and Britain need to show that it really is possible to have a system in which political leaders are held to account \u2013 and where the rule of law is a reality, not a myth. FINANCIAL TIMES"

    "close_book_answer": [
      "1. Trump's reaction to his impeachment trial reflects poorly on the image of the US as a mature democracy. His refusal to participate in the trial and his repeated claims of a \"rigged\" system undermine the basic principles of the democratic process. His behavior suggests a disregard for the rule of law and a disrespect for the institution of the presidency.",
      "2. Johnson's response to the Supreme Court ruling that his prorogation of Parliament was unlawful also reflects poorly on the image of the UK as a mature democracy. His decision to ignore the ruling and proceed with a general election without dissolving Parliament raises questions about the independence of the judiciary and the integrity of the democratic process. His behavior suggests a willingness to flout the rules and undermine the basic principles of democracy.",
      "3. The reactions of both Trump and Johnson to their current travails demonstrate a disregard for the norms and institutions of democracy. Their behavior is a cause for concern for those who value democratic values and highlights the need for continued vigilance in protecting and strengthening democratic institutions. It is essential that leaders in mature democracies uphold the rule of law and respect the independence of the judiciary and other democratic institutions in order to maintain the integrity of the democratic process."

For example, the two countries have conducted joint military exercises and training programs, which have helped to build trust and foster collaboration.",
      "Secondly, the United States has granted India the status of \"Major Defence Partner,\" which has enabled India to access advanced US defence technologies and participate in co-development and co-production projects.

    "question": "4. How has India's dependence on Western war equipment changed over time, and what does this say about their shared apprehensions about rising Chinese power?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "India's dependence on Western war equipment has evolved over time, reflecting shifts in the country's strategic environment and its relations with major powers. Historically, India has relied heavily on Soviet-era equipment, but in recent years, it has diversified its sources of procurement to include the United States, France, and Israel. This shift in procurement patterns can be attributed to several factors, including India's desire to reduce its dependence on a single supplier and to hedge against potential disruptions in the global arms market.",
      "India's growing dependence on Western war equipment is also reflective of shared apprehensions about rising Chinese power. China's military modernization and expansionist policies in the Indo-Pacific region have raised concerns among India's policymakers about the country's ability to defend itself in the event of a conflict. India's procurement of advanced Western war equipment is seen as a way to bolster its military capabilities and to deter potential Chinese aggression.",
      "Furthermore, India's partnerships with Western powers in defense procurement can be viewed as a way to balance against China's growing influence in the region. India's partnership with the United States, for example, has deepened in recent years, with both countries engaging in joint military exercises and collaborating on defense technology development. India's partnership with France has also deepened, with the two countries signing a deal for the supply of advanced Rafale fighter jets.",
      "In conclusion, India's dependence on Western war equipment has evolved over time, reflecting shifts in the country's strategic environment and its relations with major powers. This dependence is reflective of shared apprehensions about rising Chinese power, and India's partnerships with Western powers in defense procurement can be viewed as a way to balance against China's growing influence in the region."

    "question": "5. What role do Indian engineers play in US strategic interests, and how does this compare to the role of Chinese engineers?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "Indian engineers play a significant role in US strategic interests due to their expertise and contributions to various industries. They are highly skilled and educated, making them valuable assets to American companies and the US economy. Indian engineers are employed in various sectors, including technology, aerospace, and defense, where they contribute to innovation and development. Their contributions have helped the US maintain its technological edge and stay competitive in the global market.",
      "In comparison, Chinese engineers also play a crucial role in US strategic interests, but the nature of their contribution is different. While Indian engineers are valued for their expertise and innovation, Chinese engineers are viewed with suspicion due to concerns over intellectual property theft and cyber espionage. The US government has taken steps to prevent Chinese companies and engineers from gaining access to sensitive information and technology. This has led to tensions between the two countries and has impacted the role of Chinese engineers in US strategic interests.",
      "Overall, the role of Indian engineers in US strategic interests is positive and valuable, while the role of Chinese engineers is more complex and subject to scrutiny. The US government must balance the benefits of working with skilled engineers from both countries against the potential risks of intellectual property theft and cyber espionage."

      "June 2023 marks the 30th anniversary of a film that changed cinema forever. 1993\u2019s Jurassic Park used pioneering computer-generated imagery (CGI) to bring dinosaurs to life in director Steven Spielberg\u2019s adaptation of the novel of the same name.",
      "The film quickly became a must-see event, and audiences were left amazed by the spectacle of seeing believable dinosaurs grace the big screen for the first time. Jurassic Park not only made giant leaps in special-effects film-making, but it also paved the way for myriad subsequent productions that featured beasts of all shapes and sizes.",
      "Jurassic Park originated in 1983 as a screenplay by author Michael Crichton, whose previous foray into film as writer and director of Westworld (1973) featured an immersive amusement park where androids malfunctioned and caused havoc. But his dinosaur-themed story first found publication as the novel Jurassic Park, which was released in 1990 and became a bestseller.",
      "That\u2019s when it came to the attention of Spielberg. By the early 1990s, Spielberg was no stranger to big-budget science-fiction film-making. The likes of Jaws (1975), Close Encounters Of The Third Kind (1977), Raiders Of The Lost Ark (1981) and E. T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982) had demonstrated that he had a track record of making extremely successful effects-heavy but story-led films. That made Jurassic Park perfect for his next production.",
      "Spielberg\u2019s adaptation, written by Crichton and David Koepp, changed a number of aspects of the novel\u2019s ending to provide a satisfactory conclusion to the film, yet leave enough loose ends for further exploration in the franchise.",
      "Of course, Jurassic Park wasn\u2019t the first time dinosaurs had been featured on the big screen. 1933\u2019s King Kong is an early example of a film that pushed the boundaries of what was then possible by including sequences of the eponymous giant gorilla fighting with dinosaurs.",
      "Creatures were brought to life for cinemagoers by combining stop-motion animation with rear projection (where previously shot film is projected onto a backdrop and actors are recorded performing in front of it). Other feature films such as Journey To The Centre Of The Earth (1959), The Lost World (1960) and The Land That Time Forgot (1974) had attempted alternative ways of bringing dinosaurs to the screen, including puppetry and even fitting live reptiles with prosthetics.",
      "Of these methods, a combination of stop-motion animation for long shots and animatronic puppets for close-ups was initially chosen by Spielberg for Jurassic Park.",
      "Stop-motion tests produced good results, especially in the development of go-motion, a technique which blurred models to provide a sense of movement similar to that of live action.",
      "But Spielberg and his team were still keen to go further with what was possible. Dennis Muren from visual effects company Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) provided an alternative approach by using CGI modelling and animation.",
      "Off the back of pioneering CGI work in The Abyss (1989) and Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991), Muren and his team produced a test sequence of skeletal dinosaurs. Additional tests featuring a Tyrannosaurus rex with added skin further cemented the realisation that this was the way to go for the film. This technique built the model of the dinosaur from bones, added muscle and then, finally, the skin.",
      "It seemed the assembled stop-motion team had been made extinct by this innovative technology. However, the model-makers and animators were the experts on dinosaurs and their movement, and they retrained as computer animators to continue to use their skills on the production.",
      "Jurassic Park features 15 minutes of on-screen dinosaurs, of which approximately nine minutes feature Stan Winston\u2019s animatronics and six minutes feature ILM\u2019s CGI animation. The success of this combination is seen in the iconic T. rex attack scene. A number of animatronic shots feature close-ups of the T. rex before the full-height shots provide the creature\u2019s threat and power.",
      "How Spielberg orchestrates the scene, from the atmospheric, tension building of the rainstorm, through the initial reveal and reactions, the prolonged attack and subsequent escape, takes the audience through a range of emotions. Although the CGI sections are relatively short, they have a huge impact on the overall storytelling, not to mention the believability that the event is actually happening in front of us. It\u2019s a true representation of the power of cinema.",
      "On release, Jurassic Park became an instant box office success, becoming the highest-grossing film ever at that time.",
      "It also presented the perfect opportunity to develop and showcase the latest advances in CGI. The thrill of seeing the stampede of Gallimimus, the horror of the T. rex attack and the suspense of the Velociraptor hunt captivated audiences across the globe.",
      "Jurassic Park inspired a number of similarly themed movies, such as Disney\u2019s Dinosaur (2000) and the award-winning BBC television series Walking with Dinosaurs (1999). But more than that, it helped bring about a revolution in the use of CGI in film-making.",
      "From those six minutes of animated dinosaurs, CGI has become so integrated into the industry to the extent that nearly all film and television productions feature some form of CGI practice. This can simply mean digitally cleaning up aspects of the filmed image with removals and replacements, set extensions, adding CGI set models or animated vehicles and props, to filming with green screen and compositing images, or merging actors within full CGI environments.",
      "The film remains a significant point in the history of cinema that successfully announced that CGI creatures had arrived, paving the way for the following 30 years of fantasy film-making."

    "question": "1. What factors contributed to the success of Jurassic Park as a groundbreaking film?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The success of Jurassic Park as a groundbreaking film can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the use of advanced special effects and animatronics technology at the time allowed for the creation of realistic and convincing dinosaurs on screen. This immersive visual experience captivated audiences and added to the film's sense of wonder and awe.",
      "Secondly, the film's compelling story and characters, as well as its strong pacing and suspenseful atmosphere, contributed to its success. The combination of action, adventure, and horror elements made it appealing to a wide range of audiences and kept them engaged throughout the film.",
      "Finally, the marketing campaign for Jurassic Park was also a significant factor in its success. The use of teaser trailers and promotional materials that hinted at the dinosaurs without revealing too much helped to generate excitement and anticipation for the film before its release. Overall, the combination of advanced technology, a compelling story, and effective marketing contributed to the success of Jurassic Park as a groundbreaking film."

    "question": "4. In what ways did Jurassic Park pave the way for future films featuring creatures of all shapes and sizes?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "Jurassic Park, released in 1993, was a groundbreaking film that revolutionized the use of special effects in cinema. The film's portrayal of dinosaurs was so realistic that it set a new standard for creature effects in films. Jurassic Park's success paved the way for future films featuring creatures of all shapes and sizes.",
      "Firstly, the film's use of animatronics and CGI was a game-changer in the industry. The special effects used in the film were so advanced that they made the dinosaurs look like they were real. This technology was not widely available at the time, and it was the first time that it was used on such a grand scale. Jurassic Park's success inspired other filmmakers to explore the use of special effects in their films, leading to a new era of creature effects in cinema.",
      "Secondly, Jurassic Park's success also led to the creation of a new subgenre of science fiction films. Before Jurassic Park, films featuring creatures of all shapes and sizes were few and far between. However, the success of the film inspired other filmmakers to create similar films, leading to the creation of a new subgenre of science fiction films.",
      "Finally, Jurassic Park's success also led to the creation of new theme parks and attractions. The film's portrayal of a theme park filled with dinosaurs was so popular that it inspired the creation of real-life theme parks such as Jurassic Park: The Ride. These theme parks not only provided entertainment but also helped to advance the technology used in creating animatronics and other special effects.",
      "In conclusion, Jurassic Park's success paved the way for future films featuring creatures of all shapes and sizes. The film's use of advanced special effects technology, the creation of a new subgenre of science fiction films, and the creation of new theme parks and attractions were all direct results of the film's success."

      "June 2023 marks the 30th anniversary of a film that changed cinema forever. 1993\u2019s Jurassic Park used pioneering computer-generated imagery (CGI) to bring dinosaurs to life in director Steven Spielberg\u2019s adaptation of the novel of the same name.",
      "The film quickly became a must-see event, and audiences were left amazed by the spectacle of seeing believable dinosaurs grace the big screen for the first time. Jurassic Park not only made giant leaps in special-effects film-making, but it also paved the way for myriad subsequent productions that featured beasts of all shapes and sizes.",
      "Jurassic Park originated in 1983 as a screenplay by author Michael Crichton, whose previous foray into film as writer and director of Westworld (1973) featured an immersive amusement park where androids malfunctioned and caused havoc. But his dinosaur-themed story first found publication as the novel Jurassic Park, which was released in 1990 and became a bestseller.",
      "That\u2019s when it came to the attention of Spielberg. By the early 1990s, Spielberg was no stranger to big-budget science-fiction film-making. The likes of Jaws (1975), Close Encounters Of The Third Kind (1977), Raiders Of The Lost Ark (1981) and E. T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982) had demonstrated that he had a track record of making extremely successful effects-heavy but story-led films. That made Jurassic Park perfect for his next production.",
      "Spielberg\u2019s adaptation, written by Crichton and David Koepp, changed a number of aspects of the novel\u2019s ending to provide a satisfactory conclusion to the film, yet leave enough loose ends for further exploration in the franchise.",
      "Of course, Jurassic Park wasn\u2019t the first time dinosaurs had been featured on the big screen. 1933\u2019s King Kong is an early example of a film that pushed the boundaries of what was then possible by including sequences of the eponymous giant gorilla fighting with dinosaurs.",
      "Creatures were brought to life for cinemagoers by combining stop-motion animation with rear projection (where previously shot film is projected onto a backdrop and actors are recorded performing in front of it). Other feature films such as Journey To The Centre Of The Earth (1959), The Lost World (1960) and The Land That Time Forgot (1974) had attempted alternative ways of bringing dinosaurs to the screen, including puppetry and even fitting live reptiles with prosthetics.",
      "Of these methods, a combination of stop-motion animation for long shots and animatronic puppets for close-ups was initially chosen by Spielberg for Jurassic Park.",
      "Stop-motion tests produced good results, especially in the development of go-motion, a technique which blurred models to provide a sense of movement similar to that of live action.",
      "But Spielberg and his team were still keen to go further with what was possible. Dennis Muren from visual effects company Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) provided an alternative approach by using CGI modelling and animation.",
      "Off the back of pioneering CGI work in The Abyss (1989) and Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991), Muren and his team produced a test sequence of skeletal dinosaurs. Additional tests featuring a Tyrannosaurus rex with added skin further cemented the realisation that this was the way to go for the film. This technique built the model of the dinosaur from bones, added muscle and then, finally, the skin.",
      "It seemed the assembled stop-motion team had been made extinct by this innovative technology. However, the model-makers and animators were the experts on dinosaurs and their movement, and they retrained as computer animators to continue to use their skills on the production.",
      "Jurassic Park features 15 minutes of on-screen dinosaurs, of which approximately nine minutes feature Stan Winston\u2019s animatronics and six minutes feature ILM\u2019s CGI animation. The success of this combination is seen in the iconic T. rex attack scene. A number of animatronic shots feature close-ups of the T. rex before the full-height shots provide the creature\u2019s threat and power.",
      "How Spielberg orchestrates the scene, from the atmospheric, tension building of the rainstorm, through the initial reveal and reactions, the prolonged attack and subsequent escape, takes the audience through a range of emotions. Although the CGI sections are relatively short, they have a huge impact on the overall storytelling, not to mention the believability that the event is actually happening in front of us. It\u2019s a true representation of the power of cinema.",
      "On release, Jurassic Park became an instant box office success, becoming the highest-grossing film ever at that time.",
      "It also presented the perfect opportunity to develop and showcase the latest advances in CGI. The thrill of seeing the stampede of Gallimimus, the horror of the T. rex attack and the suspense of the Velociraptor hunt captivated audiences across the globe.",
      "Jurassic Park inspired a number of similarly themed movies, such as Disney\u2019s Dinosaur (2000) and the award-winning BBC television series Walking with Dinosaurs (1999). But more than that, it helped bring about a revolution in the use of CGI in film-making.",
      "From those six minutes of animated dinosaurs, CGI has become so integrated into the industry to the extent that nearly all film and television productions feature some form of CGI practice. This can simply mean digitally cleaning up aspects of the filmed image with removals and replacements, set extensions, adding CGI set models or animated vehicles and props, to filming with green screen and compositing images, or merging actors within full CGI environments.",

    "question": "5. How has the use of CGI in filmmaking evolved since the release of Jurassic Park, and what are some examples of its use in modern films?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) in filmmaking has significantly evolved since the release of Jurassic Park in 1993. CGI has become more advanced, realistic, and prevalent in modern films. One example of its use is in creating detailed and intricate environments, such as sprawling cities or fantastical landscapes. This allows filmmakers to create visually stunning scenes that would be difficult or impossible to create with practical effects.",
      "Another example of CGI's use in modern films is in creating complex characters and creatures. In Jurassic Park, the use of CGI was limited to creating the dinosaurs, but now it is used to create entire characters, from their movements to their facial expressions. This allows for a greater level of detail and realism in character design and animation.",
      "Lastly, CGI is also used to enhance action sequences and create special effects. In Jurassic Park, the use of CGI was limited to the dinosaurs, but now it is used to create complex action sequences, such as massive battles or destruction of buildings. This allows for a greater level of realism and allows filmmakers to create scenes that would be difficult or impossible to create with practical effects.",
      "Overall, the use of CGI in filmmaking has come a long way since the release of Jurassic Park, and it has become an essential tool for filmmakers to create visually stunning and realistic scenes."

    "question": "2. How does India's success in exporting generic medicine affect its relationship with the Global South?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "India's success in exporting generic medicine has had a mixed impact on its relationship with the Global South. On one hand, it has been a boon for many countries in the Global South, who can now access life-saving medicines at a fraction of the cost they would otherwise have to pay. This has helped to improve the health outcomes of millions of people in these countries, and has also helped to reduce the burden of disease on already overstretched healthcare systems.",
      "On the other hand, some countries in the Global South have criticized India for using its position as a major supplier of generic medicines to exploit their markets. They argue that India is engaged in predatory pricing, undercutting local pharmaceutical companies and driving them out of business. This, in turn, can lead to a reduction in competition in the market, and can result in higher prices for consumers in the long run.",
      "Furthermore, India's success in exporting generic medicine has also raised concerns about intellectual property rights. Many developed countries argue that India is not respecting the patents of multinational pharmaceutical companies, and that this is hurting their ability to recoup their investments in research and development. This has led to tensions between India and developed countries, and has also raised questions about the sustainability of India's generic medicine industry in the long run.",
      "In conclusion, India's success in exporting generic medicine has had a complex impact on its relationship with the Global South. While it has been a boon for many countries in the Global South, it has also raised concerns about market competition and intellectual property rights. It will be interesting to see how these issues are addressed in the years to come."

      "The FDA, for instance, has banned drugs produced by Intas Pharmaceuticals from being imported into the US.",
      "That will hurt the millions of patients who rely on the company\u2019s generic version of the cholesterol drug Lipitor. Indeed, US regulators have had to make exceptions for some of Intas\u2019 cancer drugs, which are already in very short supply.",

      "This is hardly a new problem. More than a decade ago, Ranbaxy Laboratories \u2013 then considered the jewel of India\u2019s pharma sector \u2013 had to recall tens of thousands of bottles of its generic version of Lipitor for fear that they contained tiny fragments of glass.",

      "The saga left neither India\u2019s pharma sector nor its regulators looking very good.",

      "India\u2019s muddled pharma regulation is emblematic of a broader failure to upgrade state capacity sufficiently to build trust in Indian products. The industry has 36 different regulators, allowing for unscrupulous fly-by-night operators to shop around for the most pliable jurisdiction.",
      "Fixing this is not rocket science. We have to consolidate all these regulators into one, make sure that inspection records and reviews of drug applications are made public, and put all generics manufacturers through the same tests as companies making new drugs.",

    "question": "5. What steps should India take to improve the quality and regulation of its pharmaceutical industry?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The Indian pharmaceutical industry has been facing criticism for the quality of its products and the regulation of its manufacturing processes. To improve the quality and regulation of its pharmaceutical industry, India should take several steps.",
      "Firstly, the Indian government should increase funding for the regulation and inspection of pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities. This would allow for more frequent and thorough inspections of facilities, ensuring that they are following proper manufacturing practices and producing safe and effective products. Additionally, the government should invest in the training and education of regulatory officials to ensure that they are equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to enforce regulations and identify any potential issues.",
      "Secondly, India should implement stricter penalties for companies that violate regulations or produce substandard products. This would serve as a deterrent for companies to prioritize quality and compliance over profits. The government should also consider implementing a recall system for products that do not meet quality standards, to ensure that potentially harmful products are removed from the market quickly.",
      "Finally, India should work to increase transparency and accountability within the industry. This could be achieved by requiring companies to publicly disclose information about their manufacturing processes, quality control measures, and any adverse events associated with their products. Additionally, the government should encourage the industry to adopt international standards and best practices, such as those set by the World Health Organization, to ensure that Indian pharmaceutical products are of the highest quality and safety.",
      "In conclusion, improving the quality and regulation of India's pharmaceutical industry will require a multifaceted approach, including increased funding for regulation and inspection, stricter penalties for violations, and increased transparency and accountability. By taking these steps, India can ensure that its pharmaceutical products are safe and effective, and that the industry is operating at the highest standards."

City\u2019s owner, watching his team in a competitive match for the first time since 2010, is the Emirati royal Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan. His Qatari neighbours hosted this winter\u2019s World Cup. Saudi clubs have spent the past few months signing some of the world\u2019s best players, including Cristiano Ronaldo. Meanwhile, in the week of City\u2019s triumph, Saudi Arabia effectively took control of golf\u2019s PGA tour.",
      "No region outside Western Europe has ever had such a grip on football\u2019s shiniest baubles. Many fans lament this \u2013 partly because of the Gulf monarchies\u2019 mistreatment of women, migrants, LGBT people and dissidents, and partly from a feeling that football shouldn\u2019t be for sale. There are still attempts to contest the Gulf\u2019s dominance. The Premier League has referred City to an independent commission, which will review more than 100 allegations of financial rule-breaking \u2013 charges that the club denies. But football faces a dilemma. Gulf money has made the contest at the top of the European game much more exciting than it would have been otherwise.",
      "Look at how Emirati funds lifted Manchester City from joke status into football\u2019s trendsetting team. Every City fan in Istanbul over the age of 30 could remember the years of stumbles. In 1998-1999, the team spent an embarrassing season in English football\u2019s third tier. City\u2019s fans often treated their club almost as the footballing branch of Monty Python. They waved inflatable plastic bananas and sang, surreally, \u201cWe\u2019re not really here.\u201d",
      "That old City survives only in the form of songs, dances and memories. On the field, the Emiratis transformed the club. Their money bought players who won trophies, in the process wiping out the old football cliche that held: \u201cYou can\u2019t buy a winning team.\u201d",
      "In fact, if you want a winning team, you have to buy it, with salaries and usually with transfer fees, too. The ugly truth of football economics is that the only way for Cinderella to become a princess is to be bought by a prince.",
      "City are following in the oil-fuelled slipstream of Chelsea, who were bought by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich in 2003. The two clubs between them won 12 of the last 19 English titles. They are also the only European clubs since 1999 to win a Champions League for the first time. Oil money has allowed two upstarts to beat the established powers.",
      "English football could have taken a different route, rejecting Gulf money. It could have followed Germany, with its \u201c50 + 1 rule\u201d, which states that club members must hold a majority of voting rights. That stops outsiders from taking over clubs. The rule is often praised by football traditionalists. However, it means that German football has no oil-fuelled upstarts. The consequence is that the German club with historically the highest revenues, Bayern Munich, faces no serious challengers, and has won 11 league titles in a row. The rule also means that no other club from Europe\u2019s biggest economy has a hope of winning the Champions League, whereas three different English clubs have won in just the last five seasons. Now yet another oil-fuelled challenger may be emerging: Saudi-owned Newcastle United, freshly qualified for the Champions League.",
      "Gulf money will probably keep shaping football for a while yet. Qatari Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani is bidding to buy Manchester United from the Glazer family, and Saudi Arabia may bid to host the 2030 World Cup, perhaps jointly with Greece and Egypt.",
      "The monarchies\u2019 spending on football is often explained as a cunning plan to \u201csportswash\u201d their reputations, or as an \u201cinvestment\u201d to diversify their economies away from oil and gas \u2013 even though football clubs typically lose money, especially given the salaries that the Gulf royals pay.",
      "In fact, there is a simpler explanation for why these people went into football: It\u2019s fun. It makes their friends and neighbours jealous. It\u2019s an affordable hobby for billionaires. And they face almost no competition from their peers elsewhere. Mr Abramovich and other Russian oligarchs have been expelled from the sport since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, few Chinese ever entered, while most Americans who buy into football want to make profits from their clubs, and therefore baulk at paying the salaries that would allow their teams to compete with the likes of City.",
      "So European football has become a status competition between Gulf monarchies, with City showing the potential to build a dynasty. The men\u2019s team coach, Pep Guardiola, in situ since 2016, has constructed one of the great teams in football history, even if they didn\u2019t show it in Istanbul. This season they have won the treble of Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup. They attack, they are tactically innovative, and the current squad is young enough to remain dominant. Early on Sunday morning, exhausted in triumph, Guardiola warned Real Madrid, who have won 14 Champions Leagues to City\u2019s one: \u201cWe are on our way.

      "The takeover of European football's commanding heights by the Gulf states has had a significant impact on the sport. Firstly, it has led to a significant increase in the amount of money invested in football clubs, with Gulf states such as Qatar and Abu Dhabi pouring billions of dollars into clubs across Europe. This has allowed these clubs to attract top talent and win trophies, but it has also led to concerns about the impact of money on the sport.",
      "Secondly, the takeover has also led to a shift in the balance of power in European football. Previously, the biggest clubs in Europe were based in countries such as England, Spain, and Italy, but now, with the influx of money from the Gulf states, clubs from these countries are facing increasing competition from clubs based in the Middle East. This has led to concerns about the sustainability of the sport, as well as the impact on the competitive balance of European football.",
      "Finally, the takeover has also led to concerns about the influence of the Gulf states on the sport. With these states investing heavily in European football, there are concerns that they are using the clubs as a tool of soft power, to promote their political and economic interests. This has led to accusations of political interference in the sport, as well as concerns about the impact on the integrity of the game.",

Firstly, it has allowed clubs to invest heavily in players and infrastructure, resulting in improved on-field performances and increased fan engagement. This has led to increased revenue streams for clubs, including through sponsorship deals and media rights.",
      "Secondly, the influx of Gulf money has contributed to the rising cost of players, with many top-tier clubs now able to afford the services of the world's best players. This has had a ripple effect throughout the football industry, with lower-tier clubs struggling to compete for talent and facing financial difficulties as a result.",
      "Finally, the influx of Gulf money has also led to concerns over the ownership and control of Premier League clubs. Some fans and commentators have raised concerns over the influence of foreign owners and the impact this has on the culture and identity of clubs. Additionally, there have been concerns over the use of wealthy owners to launder money and evade tax, with some high-profile cases of financial mismanagement in the Premier League.",
      "In conclusion, the influx of Gulf money has brought many benefits to the Premier League, but it has also raised important questions about the future of the football industry and the need for greater regulation and oversight."

The consequence is that the German club with historically the highest revenues, Bayern Munich, faces no serious challengers, and has won 11 league titles in a row. The rule also means that no other club from Europe\u2019s biggest economy has a hope of winning the Champions League, whereas three different English clubs have won in just the last five seasons. Now yet another oil-fuelled challenger may be emerging: Saudi-owned Newcastle United, freshly qualified for the Champions League.",
      "Gulf money will probably keep shaping football for a while yet. Qatari Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani is bidding to buy Manchester United from the Glazer family, and Saudi Arabia may bid to host the 2030 World Cup, perhaps jointly with Greece and Egypt.",
      "The monarchies\u2019 spending on football is often explained as a cunning plan to \u201csportswash\u201d their reputations, or as an \u201cinvestment\u201d to diversify their economies away from oil and gas \u2013 even though football clubs typically lose money, especially given the salaries that the Gulf royals pay.",
      "In fact, there is a simpler explanation for why these people went into football: It\u2019s fun. It makes their friends and neighbours jealous. It\u2019s an affordable hobby for billionaires. And they face almost no competition from their peers elsewhere. Mr Abramovich and other Russian oligarchs have been expelled from the sport since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, few Chinese ever entered, while most Americans who buy into football want to make profits from their clubs, and therefore baulk at paying the salaries that would allow their teams to compete with the likes of City.",
      "So European football has become a status competition between Gulf monarchies, with City showing the potential to build a dynasty. The men\u2019s team coach, Pep Guardiola, in situ since 2016, has constructed one of the great teams in football history, even if they didn\u2019t show it in Istanbul. This season they have won the treble of Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup. They attack, they are tactically innovative, and the current squad is young enough to remain dominant. Early on Sunday morning, exhausted in triumph, Guardiola warned Real Madrid, who have won 14 Champions Leagues to City\u2019s one: \u201cWe are on our way. If they fall asleep, we will be catching them.\u201d That may not have been a joke. FINANCIAL TIMES"

    "question": "5. What are the potential consequences of continued Gulf investment in football?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "1. One potential consequence of continued Gulf investment in football is the erosion of the cultural and historical significance of football clubs. As Gulf investors buy up European football clubs, they may prioritize financial gain over the traditional values and history of the club. This could lead to a loss of identity and a dilution of the club's legacy, which could be detrimental to the club's fans and the broader football community.",
      "2. Another potential consequence of continued Gulf investment in football is the potential for the exploitation of football players. Gulf investors may prioritize profit over the well-being and fair treatment of football players, leading to poor working conditions, low wages, and a lack of support for players both on and off the pitch. This could have serious consequences for the health and well-being of football players, as well as the reputation of the sport as a whole.",
      "3. Finally, continued Gulf investment in football may also have negative consequences for the broader football community. As Gulf investors gain more influence and control over European football clubs, they may prioritize their own interests over the interests of the football community as a whole. This could lead to a lack of transparency and accountability, as well as a lack of investment in the development of young football players and the growth of the sport. This could ultimately harm the long-term sustainability and growth of football as a whole."

It marked the first time that a group of individuals had publicly and collectively advocated for the ethical treatment of animals, setting the stage for future activism and advocacy efforts.",
      "One of the significant outcomes of the protest was the establishment of the Oxford Group, a student-led organization that sought to promote animal rights and challenge the prevailing cultural attitudes towards animal exploitation. The Group's efforts helped to raise public awareness about the issue and paved the way for the emergence of other animal rights organizations in the following years.",
      "The Oxford University protest also demonstrated the importance of direct action and civil disobedience as effective strategies for promoting social change. By disrupting the normal functioning of the university and drawing attention to the plight of animals, the protesters were able to generate media coverage and spark public debate on the issue.",

    "close_book_answer": [
      "In the four decades since the publication of Peter Singer's seminal work \"Animal Liberation,\" the concept of animal rights has undergone significant evolution. Initially, Singer's book brought attention to the issue of animal cruelty in farming and scientific research, sparking a movement that has led to increased public awareness and concern for animal welfare.",
      "One major development in the evolution of animal rights has been the growth of the animal protection movement, which has resulted in the creation of numerous organizations dedicated to advocating for animal welfare. These organizations have worked to promote legislation and regulations that protect animals from cruelty, such as bans on factory farming practices and mandatory humane euthanasia methods.",
      "Another significant development has been the increased recognition of animals as sentient beings with moral standing. This shift in perspective has led to a greater appreciation of the ethical implications of using animals for human purposes and has resulted in the development of new ethical frameworks for considering animal welfare.",
      "Finally, the concept of animal rights has also expanded to include a focus on the environmental impact of animal agriculture. The recognition of the negative impact of animal agriculture on the environment has led to a growing movement advocating for plant-based diets as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and protecting the planet.",
      "In conclusion, the concept of animal rights has evolved significantly since the publication of \"Animal Liberation\" in 1975. These developments have led to increased public awareness of animal welfare issues, the creation of animal protection organizations, and a greater appreciation of the ethical implications of using animals for human purposes. The concept of animal rights has also expanded to include a focus on the environmental impact of animal agriculture, highlighting the importance of sustainable and ethical food choices."

One of the most notable changes is the increased recognition of animals as sentient beings with the ability to feel pain and suffer. This has led to a shift in the way animals are treated in various settings, including agriculture, research, and entertainment.",
      "One of the legal changes is the enactment of animal protection laws. Many countries have enacted laws that prohibit cruelty to animals and require that animals be treated humanely. For example, in the United States, the Animal Welfare Act was enacted in 1966 to regulate the treatment of animals in research, exhibition, and transportation.",
      "Another legal change is the recognition of animals as legal entities. In some countries, including New Zealand and India, animals have been granted legal personhood, giving them the same rights as humans. This has implications for how animals are treated and has led to a greater emphasis on animal welfare.",
      "In addition to legal changes, there have been significant social changes in regards to animal rights. There has been a growing movement advocating for animal rights and promoting veganism as a way to reduce animal suffering. This has led to a greater awareness of the ethical implications of animal agriculture and has prompted many people to adopt a plant-based diet.",
      "Overall, the legal and social changes in regards to animal rights have been significant in recent years, reflecting a growing recognition of the moral status of animals and the need to protect their welfare."

    "question": "4. What are some of the challenges that still exist in the animal rights movement, and how can they be addressed?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "One of the challenges that still exist in the animal rights movement is the lack of understanding and education about animal rights among the general public. Many people are not aware of the ways in which animals are mistreated and exploited, and therefore do not prioritize animal rights as an issue. To address this challenge, the animal rights movement can focus on educating the public through outreach and advocacy campaigns. This can include spreading awareness through social media, organizing events and demonstrations, and collaborating with educational institutions to incorporate animal rights education into their curriculum.",
      "Another challenge is the lack of legal protection for animals. While some countries have laws that protect animals from cruelty, many do not have comprehensive animal protection laws or do not enforce them effectively. To address this challenge, the animal rights movement can work to lobby for stronger animal protection laws and to hold governments and corporations accountable for violating animal rights. This can involve working with lawmakers and legal professionals to draft and pass legislation, as well as advocating for enforcement of existing laws.",
      "Finally, a challenge that exists within the animal rights movement itself is the debate over the most effective strategies and tactics to achieve animal rights. Some advocates believe that grassroots activism and education are the most effective ways to bring about change, while others believe that legal and legislative strategies are more important. To address this challenge, the animal rights movement can encourage open dialogue and collaboration among advocates with different perspectives and approaches, and work to develop a unified strategy that incorporates a variety of tactics. By addressing these challenges and working together towards a common goal, the animal rights movement can continue to make progress towards achieving greater protections and rights for animals."

    "question": "5. How do the ethical considerations surrounding animal rights intersect with other social and environmental issues, such as sustainability and climate change?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The ethical considerations surrounding animal rights intersect with other social and environmental issues, such as sustainability and climate change, in several ways. Firstly, the industrial farming practices that are prevalent in many countries are a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. These practices, which involve the intensive confinement and breeding of animals, result in large amounts of methane and other harmful gases being released into the atmosphere. Additionally, the use of land for animal agriculture also contributes to deforestation and habitat destruction, which further exacerbates climate change.",
      "Secondly, the issue of animal rights is closely linked to the concept of sustainability. Sustainable agriculture practices, such as regenerative agriculture, prioritize the welfare of animals and the environment, while also providing food for human consumption. These practices involve the use of organic fertilizers, cover crops, and crop rotations, which help to increase soil health and fertility, sequester carbon, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "Finally, the ethical considerations surrounding animal rights also intersect with social justice issues. Factory farming often involves the exploitation of workers and low-income communities, who are often subjected to poor working conditions, low wages, and exposure to harmful chemicals. This exploitation is often linked to the global food system, which prioritizes profit over the welfare of both animals and people.",
      "In conclusion, the ethical considerations surrounding animal rights intersect with other social and environmental issues, such as sustainability and climate change, in significant ways. Addressing these issues requires a holistic approach that prioritizes the welfare of animals, the environment, and human communities."

Mr Boris Johnson may have once been commissioned to write a study of Shakespeare, but he has never taken that particular line to heart. Perhaps that\u2019s why he returned the publisher\u2019s advance.",
      "Late on Friday, Mr Johnson resigned abruptly as an MP rather than fight a by-election after an investigation found that he had misled Parliament over the Downing Street parties scandal.

He is unlikely to go gentle into that good night.",

First was Mr David Cameron, over Brexit. Next came his successor, Mrs Theresa May, over the terms of the exit deal. Finally, he scuppered his own leadership by breaking lockdown rules during the pandemic and failing to be frank about it. Now he has a fourth prime minister in his sights \u2013 Mr Sunak.",
      "Mr Johnson may be sincere in some of what he wrote in his resignation statement \u2013 the self-pity is certainly authentic and has always been his Achilles heel (as I know from my days as a newspaper editor, fending off injured replies when he felt he had been traduced \u2013 or simply not loved enough).

    "question": "2. What role does populism play in the political career of Boris Johnson?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "Populism has played a significant role in the political career of Boris Johnson. Johnson, a prominent British politician and former mayor of London, has been able to leverage populist rhetoric and policies to gain support from a broad range of voters.",
      "Firstly, Johnson's populist rhetoric has helped him to position himself as a champion of the \"people\" against the \"elite\". He has often framed himself as a maverick who is willing to challenge the establishment and speak truth to power. This has resonated with many voters who feel disenchanted with traditional political elites and are looking for a candidate who is willing to shake things up.",
      "Secondly, Johnson's populist policies have also played a key role in his political career. For example, during his time as mayor of London, he implemented policies that were popular with many voters, such as investing in public transportation and promoting affordable housing. These policies helped him to build a strong political base and increase his popularity among voters.",
      "Finally, Johnson's populist stance on issues such as immigration has also been a key factor in his political success. By positioning himself as a strong advocate for tougher immigration policies, he has been able to appeal to voters who are concerned about immigration and its impact on the economy and society. This has helped him to build a strong base of support among certain segments of the electorate.",

    "question": "3. How does Boris Johnson's relationship with the media impact his political decisions?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "1. Boris Johnson's relationship with the media has a significant impact on his political decisions. As a politician, he understands the power of media and how it can shape public opinion. Therefore, he often uses the media to promote his policies and agendas, while also attacking his opponents. This has been evident in his use of media to push for Brexit and to criticize his political rivals.",
      "2. Johnson's relationship with the media has also been criticized for its impact on the quality of political discourse in the UK. His frequent use of populist rhetoric and misleading statements has been accused of promoting division and misinformation. This has led to concerns about the role of the media in shaping public opinion and the impact it has on democratic processes.",
      "3. Despite the criticisms, Johnson's relationship with the media remains an important aspect of his political strategy. He continues to use the media to promote his policies and to attack his opponents. However, it is important for the media to maintain its independence and to hold politicians, including Johnson, accountable for their statements and actions."

    "question": "4. What are the potential consequences of Boris Johnson's continued involvement in British politics?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The continued involvement of Boris Johnson in British politics has several potential consequences. Firstly, his divisive rhetoric and controversial decisions have already caused significant harm to the country's reputation and stability. Johnson's handling of the Brexit process has resulted in economic uncertainty and political instability, which has negatively impacted the country's standing in the international community.",
      "Secondly, Johnson's political agenda has been criticized for promoting a narrow and nationalist worldview, which has led to increased polarization and division within the country. His policies have been accused of prioritizing the interests of certain groups over others, which has further exacerbated social and economic inequalities.",
      "Lastly, Johnson's continued involvement in politics has raised concerns about the erosion of democratic norms and institutions. His decision to suspend Parliament in 2019 and his recent attempt to call an early election have been criticized as undemocratic and an attempt to consolidate power. The implications of these actions on the country's democratic system and the rule of law remain to be seen.",
      "In conclusion, Boris Johnson's continued involvement in British politics has the potential to cause significant harm to the country's reputation, stability, and democratic norms. It is crucial for the country's future that political leaders work towards promoting unity, inclusivity, and respect for democratic institutions."

    "question": "1. What are the potential benefits of slowing down the rush to renovate and replace homes?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "1. One potential benefit of slowing down the rush to renovate and replace homes is the preservation of historic buildings and cultural heritage. Older homes often have unique architectural features and are a reflection of the history and culture of a community. Renovating and preserving these homes can help to maintain the character and identity of a neighborhood and prevent the loss of important cultural landmarks.",
      "2. Slowing down the rush to renovate and replace homes can also have environmental benefits. Older homes are often more energy efficient than newer ones, as they were built before modern building codes and energy standards were implemented. By preserving and upgrading these homes, rather than tearing them down and building new ones, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lower the overall environmental impact of the construction industry.",
      "3. Finally, slowing down the rush to renovate and replace homes can also help to address issues of affordability and accessibility in the housing market. By maintaining the existing housing stock, we can increase the supply of affordable housing options for low-income and middle-class families, who may not be able to afford the high costs of new construction. This can help to promote social equity and ensure that everyone has access to safe, affordable housing."

      "Another role of green loans is to create a market demand for sustainable building materials and practices. By offering financial support for green renovations, green loans help to create a market for sustainable products and services. This, in turn, encourages manufacturers and suppliers to invest in the development of new sustainable products and technologies, which can help to drive innovation in the industry.",
      "Finally, green loans help to promote sustainable development by encouraging homeowners to invest in environmentally friendly renovations. By making sustainable upgrades more accessible and affordable, green loans help to reduce carbon emissions and promote energy efficiency. This, in turn, can help to mitigate the effects of climate change and promote a more sustainable future."

      "1. One way to reduce the carbon footprint of the building and construction sector is through the use of sustainable materials and practices. This includes using materials that are renewable and have a low carbon footprint, such as bamboo or recycled steel, and incorporating energy-efficient technologies, such as solar panels or geothermal heating/cooling systems. Additionally, reducing waste during the construction process by implementing a strict waste management plan can also significantly decrease the sector's carbon footprint.",
      "2. Another way to reduce the carbon footprint of the building and construction sector is through the adoption of green building certification programs, such as LEED or BREEAM. These programs set standards for sustainable design and construction practices, and provide guidelines for reducing energy and water usage, minimizing waste, and promoting the use of renewable materials. By implementing these standards, the sector can significantly reduce its carbon footprint and contribute to a more sustainable future.",
      "3. Finally, the building and construction sector can reduce its carbon footprint by promoting the use of public transportation and walkable communities. By designing buildings and communities that prioritize pedestrian and public transportation, the sector can reduce the need for cars and thus decrease greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, encouraging the use of electric or hybrid vehicles for construction equipment can also contribute to a reduction in carbon emissions."

Many charities, such as Habitat for Humanity, accept donations of furniture, appliances, and other household items that are still in good condition. By donating these items, homeowners can help others in need while also reducing the amount of waste that ends up in landfills.",
      "3. Finally, interior elements can be repurposed or reused by repurposing them in different rooms. For example, a dresser can be repurposed as a buffet in a dining room, while an old chest of drawers can be repurposed as a coffee table in a living room. This not only gives old items a new purpose, but it also helps to maximize space and create a unique and personalized look in the home."

      "So here\u2019s a thought. Instead of pushing ahead with a technology that its leading inventors say could soon have the power to kill humans, how about not pushing ahead with it?",
      "This radical notion is prompted by a warning from the man setting up the British prime minister\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) task force.",
      "Matt Clifford observed that: \u201cYou can have really very dangerous threats to humans that could kill many humans, not all humans, simply from where we\u2019d expect models to be in two years\u2019 time.\u201d",
      "On second thoughts, maybe I\u2019m overreacting. His full remarks were more nuanced and anyway it\u2019s not all humans. Just many of them. But similarly apocalyptic warnings have come from leading figures in its development, writing under the aegis of the Centre for AI Safety.",
      "In an admirably succinct warning, a Who\u2019s Who of the AI industry stressed that: \u201cMitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.\u201d",
      "The heads of Google DeepMind, OpenAI and umpteen others have taken time off from inventing the technology that could wipe out all human life to warn the rest of us that, really, something should be done to stop this happening. And these guys are supposed to be the geniuses?",
      "Across potting sheds in England, there are any number of slightly wacky guys who have invented a new machine which might be brilliant but might also burn down their house, and most of them have managed to work out by themselves that maybe the device is not such a great idea after all.",
      "This is where the small-fry inventors have been going wrong. Perhaps instead of figuring out the risks for themselves, what they really needed to do was score several billion pounds\u2019 worth of venture capital funding and then write a letter to the local council warning that they really ought to be controlled.",
      "I recognise, to be serious, that great things are expected of artificial intelligence, many of which do not involve the obliteration of the human race. Many argue that AI could play a pivotal role in delivering a carbon-free future, though perhaps that\u2019s just a euphemism for wiping out humanity.",
      "Just as important is that the advances already made cannot be uninvented. But already AI chatbots are falsifying information \u2013 or \u201challucinating\u201d as its developers prefer to put it \u2013 and its inventors are not quite sure why.",
      "So there does seem to be an argument for slowing down and ironing out that teensy wrinkle before moving on to, you know, extinction-level technology.",
      "A generous view of the tech leaders calling for themselves to be leashed is that they are being responsible and that it\u2019s the other irresponsible actors they are worried about. They\u2019d like to do more but, you see, the guys at Google can\u2019t let themselves be beaten by the guys at Microsoft.",
      "So these warnings are an attempt to shake politicians and regulators into action, which is damned sporting of them given that world leaders have such a stellar record of responding cooperatively and intelligently to extinction-level threats.",
      "I mean come on. They\u2019ve mentioned it to the United States Congress. I don\u2019t think we could ask much more. And the British government is now on the case, which would be more reassuring if it wasn\u2019t still struggling to process asylum seekers in less than 18 months.",
      "With luck, the warnings will indeed shock governments into useful action. Maybe this leads to global standards, international agreements and a moratorium on killer developments.",

    "close_book_answer": [
      "1. One potential risk associated with the development and use of artificial intelligence is the potential for job displacement. As AI systems become more advanced and capable, they may be able to perform tasks that were previously done by humans, leading to the displacement of workers in those industries. This could have significant social and economic consequences, as it may be difficult for displaced workers to find new employment opportunities.",
      "2. Another potential risk associated with AI is the potential for bias and discrimination. If AI systems are trained on biased or incomplete data, they may make decisions that are unfair or discriminatory towards certain groups of people. This could have serious consequences in areas such as hiring, lending, and criminal justice, where AI systems are increasingly being used to make important decisions.",
      "3. A third potential risk associated with AI is the potential for misuse by malicious actors. As AI systems become more powerful and autonomous, there is a risk that they could be used to carry out attacks or other malicious activities. This could include everything from cyberattacks to physical attacks using autonomous weapons. It is important for developers and policymakers to consider these potential risks and take steps to mitigate them as AI technology continues to advance."

      "The rapid development of AI has brought about numerous benefits, but it has also raised concerns about its potential impact on society. While the technology industry has a role to play in self-regulation, it is ultimately the responsibility of governments and regulators to ensure that AI is developed and used in a safe and ethical manner. This is particularly important given the potential risks associated with AI, such as the creation of biased algorithms, job displacement, and the potential for AI to be used for malicious purposes.",
      "1. Claim: Self-regulation by the technology industry can be effective in addressing some of the potential dangers of AI.",
      "The technology industry has a vested interest in ensuring that AI is developed and used in a safe and ethical manner. As such, self-regulation can be an effective way for the industry to address some of the potential dangers of AI. For example, the industry can develop guidelines and best practices for the development and use of AI, as well as establish mechanisms for reporting and addressing potential issues.",
      "1. Claim: However, self-regulation by the technology industry alone may not be sufficient to address all potential dangers of AI.",
      "While self-regulation can be effective in addressing some of the potential dangers of AI, it may not be sufficient to address all of them.

    "question": "3. What role could AI play in addressing global challenges such as climate change and pandemics, and how can we balance the potential benefits with the potential risks?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "1. Climate change and pandemics are two of the most pressing global challenges facing humanity today. AI has the potential to play a significant role in addressing these challenges. For example, AI can be used to analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns and trends that can inform more effective policy-making and resource allocation. AI can also be used to develop more accurate models for predicting the spread of pandemics, allowing for more effective containment measures to be put in place.",
      "2. However, it is important to balance the potential benefits of AI with the potential risks. One concern is that the use of AI in addressing global challenges could exacerbate existing inequalities. For example, if AI is only used by wealthy countries or organizations, it could further marginalize already vulnerable populations. Additionally, there is a risk that AI could be used to perpetuate existing power structures, rather than challenge them.",
      "3. To ensure that AI is used in a responsible and ethical manner, it is important to have robust oversight and regulation in place. This includes ensuring that AI is transparent and accountable, and that the data it uses is collected and used in a way that respects privacy and human rights. It is also important to involve a diverse range of stakeholders in the development and deployment of AI, to ensure that its benefits are shared equitably. Ultimately, the use of AI in addressing global challenges has the potential to be transformative, but it must be approached with caution and a commitment to ethical and responsible use."

      "This is where the small-fry inventors have been going wrong. Perhaps instead of figuring out the risks for themselves, what they really needed to do was score several billion pounds\u2019 worth of venture capital funding and then write a letter to the local council warning that they really ought to be controlled.",

Many argue that AI could play a pivotal role in delivering a carbon-free future, though perhaps that\u2019s just a euphemism for wiping out humanity.",

They\u2019d like to do more but, you see, the guys at Google can\u2019t let themselves be beaten by the guys at Microsoft.",
      "So these warnings are an attempt to shake politicians and regulators into action, which is damned sporting of them given that world leaders have such a stellar record of responding cooperatively and intelligently to extinction-level threats.",
      "I mean come on. They\u2019ve mentioned it to the United States Congress. I don\u2019t think we could ask much more. And the British government is now on the case, which would be more reassuring if it wasn\u2019t still struggling to process asylum seekers in less than 18 months.",
      "With luck, the warnings will indeed shock governments into useful action. Maybe this leads to global standards, international agreements and a moratorium on killer developments.",
      "Either way, the AI gurus\u2019 consciences are now clear. They\u2019ve done all they can.",
      "And if one day, around 2025, the machines do indeed gain the power to obliterate us \u2013 sorry, many of us \u2013 I like to think that in the final seconds the AI will ping out a last inquiry to the brilliant minds who knowingly blundered ahead with a technology that could destroy us without at that stage figuring out how to, you know, stop it doing so.",

This includes ensuring that there are clear guidelines for the responsible use of AI, such as avoiding bias and discrimination, protecting privacy, and respecting human rights. Governments, industry leaders, and ethicists should work together to establish these frameworks and regulations, and regularly review and update them as AI technology evolves.",
      "2. Another claim is that transparency and accountability are crucial in ensuring that AI is developed and used ethically. This means that AI developers and users should be transparent about how their systems work, what data they use, and what decisions they make. They should also be accountable for any negative consequences of their AI systems, and be willing to take corrective action when necessary.",
      "3. Finally, it is important to promote education and awareness about AI ethics and values among both the general public and AI professionals. This includes educating people about the potential benefits and risks of AI, and encouraging them to engage in discussions and debates about the ethical implications of AI. By fostering a culture of ethical AI development and use, we can ensure that the technology is used for the benefit of all humanity."

But recent economic data has belied such expectations, indicating instead that China still faces severe challenges in getting its economy back on track.",

    "question": "1. What factors are contributing to the weak economic recovery in China despite the reopening of the country?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "1. The weak economic recovery in China despite the reopening of the country can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted global supply chains, leading to a decline in demand for Chinese goods and services. This has resulted in a significant slowdown in China's manufacturing sector, which is a key driver of the country's economic growth.",
      "2. Secondly, the Chinese government's response to the pandemic has also contributed to the weak economic recovery. While the government's measures to contain the virus were necessary to prevent further spread, they have also had a negative impact on the economy. For example, the lockdown measures have resulted in a significant decrease in consumer spending, which is a major contributor to China's economic growth.",
      "3. Finally, China's economic recovery is also being hindered by structural issues such as high levels of debt and an aging population. These factors have limited the government's ability to implement stimulus measures to boost the economy, as they are concerned about the potential for inflation and the sustainability of the country's debt levels.",
      "In conclusion, the weak economic recovery in China despite the reopening of the country is a complex issue that is influenced by a range of factors, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global supply chains, the government's response to the pandemic, and structural issues such as high levels of debt and an aging population."

    "question": "4. How can the government balance the need for monetary and fiscal stimulus to support the economy without exacerbating existing debt issues?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "1. One way the government can balance the need for monetary and fiscal stimulus to support the economy without exacerbating existing debt issues is by implementing targeted fiscal policies that are designed to boost economic growth and employment without increasing the overall level of government debt. For example, the government can invest in infrastructure projects that will create jobs and stimulate economic activity in the short term, while also providing long-term benefits in the form of improved transportation and communication networks.",
      "2. Another way to balance the need for monetary and fiscal stimulus is by using fiscal policy to support the most vulnerable members of society, such as low-income households and small businesses. This can be done through targeted tax cuts, subsidies, and other forms of financial assistance that help to offset the negative impacts of economic downturns. By providing support to those who are most in need, the government can help to ensure that the benefits of economic growth are shared more widely across society.",
      "3. Finally, the government can balance the need for monetary and fiscal stimulus by working closely with other countries and international organizations to coordinate global economic policies. This can help to ensure that individual countries are not left to face economic challenges on their own, and that the global economy is better able to respond to crises in a coordinated and effective manner. By working together, countries can share information, pool resources, and develop policies that are tailored to the specific needs of individual economies, while also promoting global economic stability and growth."

    "close_book_answer": [
      "Encouraging private sector growth and attracting foreign investment is crucial for China's economic development. The following measures can be taken to achieve these goals:",
      "Firstly, China should continue to implement market-oriented reforms that promote competition and reduce government intervention in the economy. This includes reducing bureaucratic red tape, improving the regulatory environment, and promoting transparency and accountability in government policies. By creating a more level playing field for both domestic and foreign firms, China can attract more private investment and stimulate economic growth.",
      "Secondly, China should further open up its markets to foreign investment by reducing tariffs and non-tariff barriers. This can be achieved by negotiating free trade agreements with other countries and implementing policies that encourage foreign investment in strategic sectors such as technology and infrastructure. By providing greater access to Chinese markets, foreign investors will be more likely to invest in China and help drive economic growth.",
      "Finally, China should continue to invest in education and human capital development to create a skilled and educated workforce that can attract foreign investment. This includes investing in vocational training programs, improving access to higher education, and promoting innovation and entrepreneurship. By developing a highly skilled workforce, China can create an environment that is conducive to private sector growth and attract foreign investment.",

      "Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam\u2019s announcement of his intention to run for president in the upcoming election could ignite Singaporeans\u2019 enthusiasm for the elected presidency.",
      "With incumbent President Halimah Yacob not seeking re-election, Mr Tharman said in a letter to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Thursday that he decided to put himself forward as a candidate.",
      "The decision had been taken after consultation with his family and in response to requests from Singaporeans from all walks of life, he said.",
      "A candidate with the expertise, experience and standing of Mr Tharman will have much to offer to Singapore\u2019s intra-executive branch system of checks and balances.",
      "Having been finance minister, he is well versed in domestic and international fiscal, monetary and economic matters.",
      "This means he is more than equipped to give the Government advice on such matters, as well as to keep it on its toes on matters that the president exercises custodial powers over, such as key public sector appointments and use of national reserves.",
      "For all of Mr Tharman\u2019s formidable qualities, a contest for the presidency should not be ruled out at this stage.",
      "Even though he is resigning from the Cabinet, given his ties to the ruling People\u2019s Action Party (PAP), Mr Tharman\u2019s candidacy might inspire hopefuls from the private sector who believe that they are equal to the task of being president and are able to gain the support of voters who prefer a non-establishment candidate.",
      "Potential rivals might also hope to leverage the argument for having a contest this round. Out of five presidential elections since 1993, only two were contested (in 1993 and 2011). The act of casting a ballot is significant for democratic choice and for candidates to gain a fair hearing.",
      "As a Nominated Member of Parliament between 2012 and 2014, I had the opportunity to observe close-up Mr Tharman in action in Parliament. In fielding parliamentary questions, he was scrupulously respectful of parliamentarians from across the aisle.",
      "He always endeavoured to answer queries without seeking partisan advantage. During debates on his Budget statements, he was also very persuasive with his erudite arguments and patient explanations in the face of MPs\u2019 calls for the Government to do more, to spend more, and to tax less.",
      "He never talked down to his parliamentary colleagues, especially the opposition.",
      "His people\u2019s touch and connection with the ground are well known.",
      "In addition to his Meet-the-People Sessions, his constituents know where to find him on weekends when he is in his constituency.",
      "Mr Tharman also has a reputation of being independent-minded, even as a senior Cabinet member.",
      "In making the case for a broader meritocracy, \u201ca meritocracy through life\u201d, and of our social safety net as a \u201ctrampoline\u201d, his take was aligned with the Government\u2019s fundamental premise. But in offering refreshing insights of how policies could \u2013 and have, in fact \u2013 evolved, he was able to nudge innovation to keep longstanding policies fit for purpose.",
      "That independence of mind was noted by PM Lee in his letter to Mr Tharman on Thursday. This trait could be seen in Mr Tharman\u2019s calls for critical analysis and objective self-examination.",
      "For example, commenting on his party\u2019s performance in the 2020 General Election, when the PAP lost two group representation constituencies (GRCs) and saw a significant vote shift against it, Mr Tharman wrote in a Facebook post that the results were good for the PAP: \u201cFirst, it secured a solid mandate. Trust in the PAP to run the government and do what is best for Singaporeans is intact. Second, the swing in votes (though from an unrepeatable high in 2015) is leading the party to review its own game so as to win the hearts, and not just the minds, of a changing electorate.",
      "\u201cThe results were also good for opposition politics \u2013 and not merely because they won more votes collectively. The stronger vote for the WP (Workers\u2019 Party) than others, with its more reasonable brand and eschewing of campaigning around a single political figure, reflected a discerning public and a political culture that bodes well for Singapore...\u201d",
      "PM Lee correctly noted that Mr Tharman\u2019s imminent departure from the Cabinet and the PAP would be a \u201cheavy loss\u201d.",
      "There will be massive shoes to fill in his Jurong GRC, which has always been among the party\u2019s best-performing constituencies.",
      "The PAP will lose a heavyweight popular politician with mass appeal, especially among swing voters who desire a PAP that can score points not just through the sheer logic of its effective policies, but through winning hearts as well.",
      "Outside of Singapore, Mr Tharman is well known in financial and economic circles, and is much sought after to serve on international panels such as the International Monetary and Financial Committee.",
      "If he serves as president, and as the chief ambassador of our nation, we can expect the views and concerns of Singapore to be prominently articulated and carefully considered by the international community.",
      "There is another potential plus point for Mr Tharman\u2019s candidacy. If there is a contest and he wins, the result would lay to rest the conventional view that an ethnic Chinese male candidate will have a firm electoral edge over a minority candidate.",
      "Mr Tharman is one of few politicians who have transcended political and racial lines and can show the way forward as our multiracialism matures. This is his signature appeal and it would add to the presidency as the symbol of national unity. This role of the president should not be understated at a time of geopolitical uncertainty and more contested politics domestically.",
      "Each president brings unique qualities to the office and they have reshaped, within the established constitutional strictures, how the presidency remains relevant to Singapore\u2019s system of government and governance and to the people as well.",
      "Mr Tharman\u2019s intent to seek election as president offers the promise of Singaporeans refining and adapting the presidency in tandem with the times and changing aspirations.",
      "If elected, his presidency will be an overall gain for the country."

      "Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam\u2019s announcement of his intention to run for president in the upcoming election could ignite Singaporeans\u2019 enthusiasm for the elected presidency.",
      "With incumbent President Halimah Yacob not seeking re-election, Mr Tharman said in a letter to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Thursday that he decided to put himself forward as a candidate.",
      "The decision had been taken after consultation with his family and in response to requests from Singaporeans from all walks of life, he said.",
      "A candidate with the expertise, experience and standing of Mr Tharman will have much to offer to Singapore\u2019s intra-executive branch system of checks and balances.",
      "Having been finance minister, he is well versed in domestic and international fiscal, monetary and economic matters.",
      "This means he is more than equipped to give the Government advice on such matters, as well as to keep it on its toes on matters that the president exercises custodial powers over, such as key public sector appointments and use of national reserves.",
      "For all of Mr Tharman\u2019s formidable qualities, a contest for the presidency should not be ruled out at this stage.",
      "Even though he is resigning from the Cabinet, given his ties to the ruling People\u2019s Action Party (PAP), Mr Tharman\u2019s candidacy might inspire hopefuls from the private sector who believe that they are equal to the task of being president and are able to gain the support of voters who prefer a non-establishment candidate.",
      "Potential rivals might also hope to leverage the argument for having a contest this round. Out of five presidential elections since 1993, only two were contested (in 1993 and 2011). The act of casting a ballot is significant for democratic choice and for candidates to gain a fair hearing.",
      "As a Nominated Member of Parliament between 2012 and 2014, I had the opportunity to observe close-up Mr Tharman in action in Parliament. In fielding parliamentary questions, he was scrupulously respectful of parliamentarians from across the aisle.",
      "He always endeavoured to answer queries without seeking partisan advantage. During debates on his Budget statements, he was also very persuasive with his erudite arguments and patient explanations in the face of MPs\u2019 calls for the Government to do more, to spend more, and to tax less.",
      "He never talked down to his parliamentary colleagues, especially the opposition.",
      "His people\u2019s touch and connection with the ground are well known.",
      "In addition to his Meet-the-People Sessions, his constituents know where to find him on weekends when he is in his constituency.",
      "Mr Tharman also has a reputation of being independent-minded, even as a senior Cabinet member.",
      "In making the case for a broader meritocracy, \u201ca meritocracy through life\u201d, and of our social safety net as a \u201ctrampoline\u201d, his take was aligned with the Government\u2019s fundamental premise. But in offering refreshing insights of how policies could \u2013 and have, in fact \u2013 evolved, he was able to nudge innovation to keep longstanding policies fit for purpose.",
      "That independence of mind was noted by PM Lee in his letter to Mr Tharman on Thursday. This trait could be seen in Mr Tharman\u2019s calls for critical analysis and objective self-examination.",
      "For example, commenting on his party\u2019s performance in the 2020 General Election, when the PAP lost two group representation constituencies (GRCs) and saw a significant vote shift against it, Mr Tharman wrote in a Facebook post that the results were good for the PAP: \u201cFirst, it secured a solid mandate. Trust in the PAP to run the government and do what is best for Singaporeans is intact. Second, the swing in votes (though from an unrepeatable high in 2015) is leading the party to review its own game so as to win the hearts, and not just the minds, of a changing electorate.",
      "\u201cThe results were also good for opposition politics \u2013 and not merely because they won more votes collectively. The stronger vote for the WP (Workers\u2019 Party) than others, with its more reasonable brand and eschewing of campaigning around a single political figure, reflected a discerning public and a political culture that bodes well for Singapore...\u201d",
      "PM Lee correctly noted that Mr Tharman\u2019s imminent departure from the Cabinet and the PAP would be a \u201cheavy loss\u201d.",
      "There will be massive shoes to fill in his Jurong GRC, which has always been among the party\u2019s best-performing constituencies.",
      "The PAP will lose a heavyweight popular politician with mass appeal, especially among swing voters who desire a PAP that can score points not just through the sheer logic of its effective policies, but through winning hearts as well.",
      "Outside of Singapore, Mr Tharman is well known in financial and economic circles, and is much sought after to serve on international panels such as the International Monetary and Financial Committee.",
      "If he serves as president, and as the chief ambassador of our nation, we can expect the views and concerns of Singapore to be prominently articulated and carefully considered by the international community.",
      "There is another potential plus point for Mr Tharman\u2019s candidacy. If there is a contest and he wins, the result would lay to rest the conventional view that an ethnic Chinese male candidate will have a firm electoral edge over a minority candidate.",
      "Mr Tharman is one of few politicians who have transcended political and racial lines and can show the way forward as our multiracialism matures. This is his signature appeal and it would add to the presidency as the symbol of national unity. This role of the president should not be understated at a time of geopolitical uncertainty and more contested politics domestically.",
      "Each president brings unique qualities to the office and they have reshaped, within the established constitutional strictures, how the presidency remains relevant to Singapore\u2019s system of government and governance and to the people as well.",
      "Mr Tharman\u2019s intent to seek election as president offers the promise of Singaporeans refining and adapting the presidency in tandem with the times and changing aspirations.",
      "If elected, his presidency will be an overall gain for the country."
    ],
    "question": "2. How might Mr. Tharman's background and experience as finance minister influence his potential role as president?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "As a finance minister, Mr. Tharman has extensive experience in managing the country's finances and economic policies. This background and expertise may influence his potential role as president in several ways.",
      "Firstly, Mr. Tharman's experience in managing the country's finances may enable him to make informed decisions on economic issues, such as fiscal policy and monetary policy. He may have a better understanding of the country's financial situation and be able to develop strategies to address any economic challenges.",
      "Secondly, Mr. Tharman's experience in managing the country's finances may also influence his approach to social policies. As finance minister, he may have been involved in developing policies to address social issues such as poverty, healthcare, and education. This experience may enable him to approach the role of president with a broader perspective that considers both economic and social issues.",
      "Finally, Mr. Tharman's experience as finance minister may also influence his approach to foreign policy. As finance minister, he may have been involved in negotiations with other countries on economic and trade issues. This experience may enable him to approach foreign policy with a focus on economic diplomacy and to promote the country's economic interests while also maintaining good relations with other countries.",
      "In conclusion, Mr. Tharman's background and experience as finance minister may influence his potential role as president in several ways, including his ability to make informed decisions on economic issues, his approach to social policies, and his approach to foreign policy."

      "Mr. Tharman's reputation for independence and critical analysis can contribute to his potential presidency in several ways. Firstly, his ability to think critically and independently allows him to make well-informed decisions that are not influenced by personal biases or political agendas. This is crucial in a president who represents all Singaporeans and must make decisions that are in the best interest of the country.",
      "Secondly, Mr. Tharman's reputation for independence and critical analysis can help to build trust and confidence in his leadership. Singaporeans value a leader who is able to think critically and make well-informed decisions, especially in a rapidly changing global environment. Mr. Tharman's reputation for being independent and critical can help to reassure Singaporeans that he is the right person to lead the country into the future.",
      "Lastly, Mr. Tharman's reputation for independence and critical analysis can help to promote a culture of openness and transparency in government. By being independent and critical, Mr. Tharman can help to ensure that decisions are made in a transparent and accountable manner, which is important for building trust and confidence in government. Overall, Mr. Tharman's reputation for independence and critical analysis can help to make him a strong and effective president."

      "As I head into my mid-50s, one of my fears of ageing is that I will be increasingly marginalised, and eventually rendered invisible, as I get older.",
      "After all, when one\u2019s career slows and then stops, one loses status and significance. As one\u2019s health declines, one is gradually robbed of autonomy. It is not far a slide from there to a frail old age dependent on others. And then one day, I may be a patient in a nursing home, calling in vain for a nursing aide to get me a bedpan, and if she is slow, I may soil my bed; or, shudders, I might be deemed a \u201cdifficult\u201d patient who needs to be physically restrained in bed.",
      "My mind also goes to those who live by themselves, who may die alone, their bodies undiscovered for days. Such are the deep-seated fears of ageing many of us in Singapore have.",
      "My fears of ageing coalesced when I watched the recently released National Day Parade song. Titled Shine Your Light, it is upbeat and has a youthful vibe. When I watched it the first few times, I could only see what was not there \u2013 scanning the lead singers and dancers, I wondered, where were the older faces?",
      "I felt marginalised as an older Singaporean. It wasn\u2019t until a colleague pointed them out, that I spotted the older faces.",
      "The fear of being made invisible struck home vividly, in a different way, when I was showing a friend from Australia around Singapore. As we went around my estate, and to nearby hawker centres and the beach at East Coast, my friend would have a friendly word of greeting to those we met, especially the security guards, the cleaners and the landscape workers.",
      "Australian society is generally quite egalitarian, and my friend is a convivial person. But I noticed something odd \u2013 few workers returned the greeting, because they were mostly looking down, or away. One was so wrapped up in his own world, he didn\u2019t even realise someone was saying \u201chello\u201d to him.",
      "It struck me that having become so used to being ignored by people around them, they were unused to being greeted in a friendly manner. I also reflected with a sense of embarrassment that I would seldom give a second glance to these workers, especially those in my estate. When my friend suggested offering drinks to the workers who tended to the grounds near my apartment, I said, please don\u2019t.",
      "I realised that while I think of myself as being a sociable and kind person, and I enjoy interacting with Singaporean workers such as hawkers (my late parents were hawkers), those warm feelings did not extend to the migrant workers in our midst. And the closer they work to my home, the greater my discomfort at extending normal social courtesies to them. I prefer to maintain a social distance, and to remain an anonymous resident, not the friendly one who offered them drinks.",
      "In Singapore, many of us have become used to ignoring the workers in our midst who toil for our safety or comfort. Covid-19 helped soften our hearts, but I don\u2019t think the effect was long-lasting.",
      "Psychology research has a lot to say about what happens when people feel ignored or shunned. The pain of social exclusion is experienced in the brain in the same way that physical pain is felt \u2013 in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex \u2013 a brain region associated with the emotional aspects of physical pain.",
      "Using group computer games, various researchers found that even short periods of being ostracised can have lingering effects on feelings, and ultimately affect behaviour, regardless of personality type. Being given the silent treatment, or being bullied, can thus have deep effects on people.",
      "Even being ostracised or ignored by strangers is experienced as hurtful, something we can all attest to \u2013 just recall how it felt when someone suddenly left their seat when we sat next to them; or crossed the road when we approached.",
      "Psychologists theorise that social exclusion is so painful because it is experienced as a threat to safety: human beings are social creatures with hardwired needs for safety, a sense of belonging and self-esteem. These needs are threatened when we are ignored, or shunned, or made to feel invisible. The worst would be to feel erased, as though we had no right to exist. In social animals, being left out of a group can literally be a death sentence, as they are left to fend for themselves against predators.",
      "\u201cBeing excluded or ostracised is an invisible form of bullying that doesn\u2019t leave bruises, and therefore we often underestimate its impact,\u201d said professor of psychological sciences Kipling D. Williams of Purdue University who researches social ostracisation. \u201cBeing excluded by high school friends, office colleagues, or even spouses or family members can be excruciating.\u201d",
      "When someone is ostracised, they go through three stages of response. First is the experience of being ignored or shunned, which leads to feelings of rejection. The next stage is coping, when people adapt behaviours to try to fit in, such as trying to please the group. If this doesn\u2019t work, they may give up trying to fit in and resort to being noticed, by disruptive or aggressive behaviours. If the shunning is prolonged, the person eventually gives up. Feelings of anger and sadness may linger even if the person becomes resigned to the situation. As Prof Williams said: \u201cLong-term ostracism can result in alienation, depression, helplessness, and feelings of unworthiness.\u201d",
      "I had felt the sting of feeling invisible as an older Singaporean in response to an upbeat music video that appeared targeted at the younger generation; but in my everyday life, I am one of those whose behaviour slaps on a cloak of invisibility on others around me.",
      "If it hurt, even a little, to feel ignored by a national song, what would it feel like for migrant workers, or those in menial jobs, or the isolated elderly, who are ignored and shunned by those around them every day? For me, it was a momentary twinge, but what if invisibility and loneliness for these groups were a constant ache amid the bustle in a country as prosperous as Singapore?"

    "question": "1. What are the potential psychological effects of social exclusion on individuals?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "Social exclusion refers to the act of deliberately or unintentionally leaving someone out of a social activity or interaction. This can have significant psychological effects on individuals, including feelings of loneliness, isolation, and depression. Studies have shown that social exclusion can activate the same neural pathways in the brain as physical pain, highlighting the intensity of the emotional experience.",
      "One potential psychological effect of social exclusion is a decrease in self-esteem. When individuals are excluded from social activities, they may interpret this as a rejection of their worth as a person. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem, which can impact their overall well-being and mental health.",
      "Another potential effect of social exclusion is an increase in anxiety and stress. When individuals are excluded from social activities, they may feel a sense of uncertainty and insecurity about their social status and relationships. This can lead to feelings of anxiety and stress, which can impact their ability to function in daily life.",
      "Overall, social exclusion can have significant psychological effects on individuals, including feelings of loneliness, isolation, depression, and decreased self-esteem. It is important for individuals to recognize the potential impact of social exclusion and take steps to prevent it from occurring."

    "question": "2. How does ageism contribute to the marginalization of older individuals in society?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "Ageism is a form of discrimination and prejudice towards individuals based on their age. It contributes to the marginalization of older individuals in society in several ways. Firstly, ageism can result in older individuals being excluded from the workforce. Employers may assume that older workers are less productive or less willing to learn new skills, leading to age discrimination in hiring and promotion practices. This can result in older individuals being forced into early retirement or struggling to find new employment opportunities.",
      "Secondly, ageism can lead to social isolation and exclusion. Older individuals may be excluded from social activities or denied access to services and resources due to negative stereotypes and prejudices about their age group. This can result in a loss of social connections and support networks, further marginalizing older individuals in society.",
      "Finally, ageism can have negative impacts on health and well-being. Older individuals may face age-based health disparities, such as being prescribed less effective medications or receiving suboptimal medical care due to ageist attitudes held by healthcare providers. This can result in poorer health outcomes and reduced quality of life for older individuals.",
      "In conclusion, ageism contributes to the marginalization of older individuals in society by limiting their opportunities in the workforce, excluding them from social activities, and negatively impacting their health and well-being. It is important to challenge and combat ageism in order to create a more inclusive and equitable society for all ages."

      "1. One way to ensure that everyone feels included and valued is by promoting diversity and inclusivity in all aspects of society, including education, employment, and community involvement. This can be achieved through initiatives such as anti-discrimination policies, diversity training programs, and outreach efforts to underrepresented groups.",
      "2. Another way to promote inclusion is by creating opportunities for people of all ages and backgrounds to participate in decision-making processes. This can be done through the use of inclusive decision-making models, such as consensus-based decision making, and by providing opportunities for people to voice their opinions and ideas.",
      "3. Finally, it is important to recognize and address systemic barriers that may prevent certain groups from feeling included and valued. This can be done through policies and programs that address poverty, inequality, and discrimination, as well as through efforts to increase access to education and healthcare. By working together to promote inclusion and address systemic barriers, we can create a society where everyone feels valued and respected."

      "As I head into my mid-50s, one of my fears of ageing is that I will be increasingly marginalised, and eventually rendered invisible, as I get older.",
      "After all, when one\u2019s career slows and then stops, one loses status and significance. As one\u2019s health declines, one is gradually robbed of autonomy. It is not far a slide from there to a frail old age dependent on others. And then one day, I may be a patient in a nursing home, calling in vain for a nursing aide to get me a bedpan, and if she is slow, I may soil my bed; or, shudders, I might be deemed a \u201cdifficult\u201d patient who needs to be physically restrained in bed.",
      "My mind also goes to those who live by themselves, who may die alone, their bodies undiscovered for days. Such are the deep-seated fears of ageing many of us in Singapore have.",
      "My fears of ageing coalesced when I watched the recently released National Day Parade song. Titled Shine Your Light, it is upbeat and has a youthful vibe. When I watched it the first few times, I could only see what was not there \u2013 scanning the lead singers and dancers, I wondered, where were the older faces?",
      "I felt marginalised as an older Singaporean. It wasn\u2019t until a colleague pointed them out, that I spotted the older faces.",
      "The fear of being made invisible struck home vividly, in a different way, when I was showing a friend from Australia around Singapore. As we went around my estate, and to nearby hawker centres and the beach at East Coast, my friend would have a friendly word of greeting to those we met, especially the security guards, the cleaners and the landscape workers.",
      "Australian society is generally quite egalitarian, and my friend is a convivial person. But I noticed something odd \u2013 few workers returned the greeting, because they were mostly looking down, or away. One was so wrapped up in his own world, he didn\u2019t even realise someone was saying \u201chello\u201d to him.",
      "It struck me that having become so used to being ignored by people around them, they were unused to being greeted in a friendly manner. I also reflected with a sense of embarrassment that I would seldom give a second glance to these workers, especially those in my estate. When my friend suggested offering drinks to the workers who tended to the grounds near my apartment, I said, please don\u2019t.",
      "I realised that while I think of myself as being a sociable and kind person, and I enjoy interacting with Singaporean workers such as hawkers (my late parents were hawkers), those warm feelings did not extend to the migrant workers in our midst. And the closer they work to my home, the greater my discomfort at extending normal social courtesies to them. I prefer to maintain a social distance, and to remain an anonymous resident, not the friendly one who offered them drinks.",
      "In Singapore, many of us have become used to ignoring the workers in our midst who toil for our safety or comfort. Covid-19 helped soften our hearts, but I don\u2019t think the effect was long-lasting.",
      "Psychology research has a lot to say about what happens when people feel ignored or shunned. The pain of social exclusion is experienced in the brain in the same way that physical pain is felt \u2013 in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex \u2013 a brain region associated with the emotional aspects of physical pain.",
      "Using group computer games, various researchers found that even short periods of being ostracised can have lingering effects on feelings, and ultimately affect behaviour, regardless of personality type. Being given the silent treatment, or being bullied, can thus have deep effects on people.",
      "Even being ostracised or ignored by strangers is experienced as hurtful, something we can all attest to \u2013 just recall how it felt when someone suddenly left their seat when we sat next to them; or crossed the road when we approached.",
      "Psychologists theorise that social exclusion is so painful because it is experienced as a threat to safety: human beings are social creatures with hardwired needs for safety, a sense of belonging and self-esteem. These needs are threatened when we are ignored, or shunned, or made to feel invisible. The worst would be to feel erased, as though we had no right to exist. In social animals, being left out of a group can literally be a death sentence, as they are left to fend for themselves against predators.",

      "In the end, it was my addiction to the latter that proved my downfall: in a moment of distraction, my thumb found its way to the Twitter app, and there it was, right in front of me: a tweet containing a giant spoiler.",
      "Some might argue that I should have just watched the 90-minute episode when it aired \u2013 which was 2am in London \u2013 or at least as soon after that as possible (I would counter that I had other, more important things to do). They might also lament my inability to avoid social media, where TV series are often discussed (I have since installed a Twitter-blocking app, which is remarkably effective).",
      "But what is the correct etiquette when it comes to sharing spoilers? Surely we don\u2019t have to watch every show we love as soon as it comes out. And what of the \u201cspoilees\u201d: those who actively share plot details because they feel part of a cultural moment and want to signal that they are au courant?",
      "I ran a (somewhat unscientific) Twitter poll this week to get other people\u2019s thoughts. The results were quite clear: of 478 votes, the biggest group \u2013 just over 33 per cent \u2013 felt spoilers shouldn\u2019t be shared until at least a week after a show has aired, if ever. Almost as many said a few days to a week was the right amount of time. Only 22 per cent thought it was acceptable to share spoilers immediately, as the LA Times did earlier in the series, publishing a faux-obituary for a certain key character minutes after Succession had aired.",
      "It\u2019s not just TV shows that can be spoiled. Unless an author has himself written a spoiler into a story (like Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cstar-cross\u2019d lovers\u201d, whose fate we are told in the prologue of Romeo and Juliet), I don\u2019t want any clues as to what might happen in plays or novels, either. And there is sometimes fun to be had by not revealing an ending, as audiences of Agatha Christie\u2019s The Mousetrap, the longest-running play in history, have largely managed since 1952.",
      "But is our spoilerphobia warranted? Perhaps not. A study published in 2011 by two psychologists at the University of California, San Diego, found that spoilers not only do not ruin the enjoyment of stories; they actually increase it. Participants were given three short stories each to read, from three different genres \u2013 mystery, literary and \u201cironic-twist\u201d. One of these stories had a \u201cspoiler\u201d paragraph at the start, in which the plot was discussed, and the ending revealed in a way that seemed inadvertent. In all three categories, readers enjoyed these \u201cspoiled\u201d versions more.",
      "\u201cWhat people liked was a better understanding of the story,\u201d Mr Jon Leavitt, one of the study\u2019s authors, tells me.

      "I can relate to this. In films I\u2019ve seen multiple times, I still root for the guy to get the girl; I still hope the catastrophe I know is coming can be averted. There are also times when having a better understanding can improve the experience \u2013 I always read the synopsis before going to see an opera.",
      "But there is a difference between choosing to find out what happens and suddenly learning something you were not meant to. The former is not really a \u201cspoiler\u201d at all, but the latter is, and there is a sense of disappointment in an accidental discovery \u2013 both in fiction and in life.",
      "Other research has provided a more nuanced picture. A 2016 study found that those of us who have what psychologists call a \u201cneed for cognition\u201d \u2013 that is, who are inclined to undergo effortful cognitive activity \u2013 are more likely to want to be kept in suspense. So are those of us who have a \u201cneed for affect\u201d, meaning a desire to experience many different emotional states. I think I have a need for both.",

I propose, for future \u201cappointment TV\u201d, a 24-hour embargo for the discussion of crucial plot developments to allow all time zones to catch up. After that, it is open season.",

    "question": "2. How does the \"need for cognition\" and \"need for affect\" impact an individual's preference for being kept in suspense or learning the ending of a story?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "Individuals with a high need for cognition are more likely to prefer being kept in suspense when it comes to the ending of a story. This is because they enjoy the mental challenge of trying to figure out what will happen next and the satisfaction of solving the puzzle. On the other hand, individuals with a high need for affect are more likely to prefer learning the ending of a story as they enjoy the emotional impact and the ability to connect with the characters on a deeper level.",
      "Furthermore, the need for cognition and need for affect can also impact an individual's preference for different types of stories. For example, those with a high need for cognition may prefer stories with complex plot twists and unexpected turns, while those with a high need for affect may prefer stories with a more straightforward narrative that focuses on emotional impact.",
      "Additionally, an individual's preference for being kept in suspense or learning the ending of a story can also be influenced by their personality traits. For example, individuals who are more open to new experiences may prefer being kept in suspense, while those who are more closed off may prefer to know the ending of a story.",
      "In conclusion, the need for cognition and need for affect play a significant role in an individual's preference for being kept in suspense or learning the ending of a story. It is important to consider an individual's personality traits and preferences when deciding whether to reveal the ending of a story or to keep the audience in suspense."

The nature of social media allows for instant communication and sharing of information, which can lead to the unintentional spoiling of content for others. Users may post updates or comments about a recent episode or movie without realizing that it could ruin the experience for others who have not yet viewed it.",
      "Moreover, social media platforms also provide a space for intentional spoilers, where individuals may actively seek out and share spoilers with others. This can be particularly problematic for fans of a series or franchise who are invested in discussing and analyzing the content with others.",
      "Individuals who want to avoid spoilers should take steps to minimize their exposure to potential spoilers on social media. This may include setting up filters or alerts for keywords related to the content they want to avoid, avoiding certain hashtags or groups, and being mindful of the timing of their social media activity. Additionally, individuals can also engage in discussions about spoilers and their impact on the viewing experience, as well as the ethics of sharing spoilers on social media."

    "close_book_answer": [
      "The Singapore Turf Club (STC) has played a significant role in the history and development of horse racing in Singapore. Since its establishment in 1842, the STC has been instrumental in shaping the sport in the country. One of the key ways in which the STC has contributed to the development of horse racing in Singapore is through the creation of a world-class racing facility. The STC has invested heavily in the development of its premises, ensuring that it provides a safe and comfortable environment for both horses and riders. The club has also worked to attract top-level trainers and jockeys, ensuring that the quality of racing in Singapore is consistently high.",
      "Another way in which the STC has contributed to the development of horse racing in Singapore is through its commitment to promoting the sport. The club has worked to raise awareness of horse racing among the general public and has also taken steps to attract new fans to the sport. For example, the STC has introduced a range of initiatives aimed at making horse racing more accessible to families and young people. These efforts have helped to ensure that horse racing remains a popular and relevant sport in Singapore.",
      "Finally, the STC has also made significant contributions to the development of the industry as a whole. The club has worked closely with government agencies and other stakeholders to develop policies and regulations that promote the growth of the sport. The STC has also played a key role in developing the skills and knowledge of those working in the industry, through its training programs and other initiatives. These efforts have helped to ensure that the horse racing industry in Singapore is well-regulated, sustainable, and competitive.",
      "In conclusion, the Singapore Turf Club has made a significant contribution to the history and development of horse racing in Singapore.

    "question": "4. How can the government balance the preservation of historical landmarks and the need for economic sustainability in land-use planning?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "1. One possible solution to balance the preservation of historical landmarks and economic sustainability in land-use planning is through the implementation of a preservation-oriented land-use planning approach. This approach prioritizes the preservation of historical landmarks and cultural heritage sites while also considering the need for economic sustainability. This can be achieved by designating certain areas as heritage conservation districts or by implementing zoning regulations that restrict the use of land in certain areas to preserve historical landmarks.",
      "2. Another solution is to adopt a mixed-use development approach that combines the preservation of historical landmarks with economic development. This approach allows for the reuse of historical buildings and sites for commercial or residential purposes while also preserving their historical and cultural significance. This can be achieved by offering tax incentives or other financial incentives to developers who invest in the restoration and reuse of historical landmarks.",
      "3. Additionally, the government can also encourage public-private partnerships to fund the preservation and restoration of historical landmarks. This approach allows for the preservation of historical landmarks while also generating economic benefits for the community. The government can provide funding or tax incentives to private companies that invest in the preservation and restoration of historical landmarks, which can also create job opportunities and increase tourism revenue."

      "The return of 120ha of land, occupied by the Singapore Turf Club (STC) since 1999, to the Government by March 2027 marks the end of more than 180 years of horse racing in Singapore. Local racing operations at Kranji will cease in 2024, with the last event scheduled for Oct 5, coinciding with the 100th Grand Singapore Gold Cup. Racing enthusiasts naturally bemoan the passing of an era in which the club, founded under a different name in 1842, saw the inaugural Singapore Cup race being held in 1843 and the first run of the Singapore Derby in 1880. The Bukit Timah Racecourse, built in 1933, would come to be regarded as the finest in the East. Local turf history was made in 1981 when two Australians became the first women granted permits to ride. In between and after such milestones, the club has served as a place not only for punters to come together to witness the drama of money to be made (or lost) from the competitive display of equestrian skills, but also as a companionable arena in which to socialise with the fellow-minded.",
      "Sadly, horse racing has witnessed dwindling spectatorship over the years. Now, the last race is about to be run. Yet, the greater reason for the STC\u2019s closure lies in the compulsions of land-use planning in Singapore. The Government is obliged to review its land-use plans continually to meet today\u2019s needs, while ensuring that there is sufficient land for future generations. The redevelopment of the Singapore Racecourse site would allow for the land and its surroundings to be transformed to meet future land-use needs better. Building housing at the site would support the development of Woodlands Regional Centre as Singapore\u2019s largest northern economic hub. Other major plans include redeveloping the Woodlands Checkpoint, enhancing Woodlands Town, and turning Lim Chu Kang into a high-tech agri-food cluster. Yet other potential uses include leisure and recreation.",
      "Also, given that the closure of the club would not have a significant impact on government finances, the authorities need to optimise the value of the racecourse as a national resource in the interests of all Singaporeans, not just the equestrian and punting communities. Public policy decisions are never easy, particularly when they involve weighing legitimate social sentiments against pressing economic imperatives. Golf, another land-intensive sport, has seen several clubs come under the unsentimental gaze of land-use planning. There is no denying the nostalgia associated with historical places of sports.

    "close_book_answer": [
      "Sports and recreational activities play a significant role in shaping the social landscape and identity of a city-state like Singapore. Firstly, these activities bring people together and foster a sense of community. Singapore has a diverse population with different ethnic and cultural backgrounds, and sports and recreational activities provide a platform for people from different backgrounds to come together and interact, breaking down social barriers and promoting social cohesion.",
      "Secondly, sports and recreational activities are an integral part of Singapore's identity. Singapore is known for its love of sports, and the country has a strong sports culture that is deeply ingrained in its society. Singapore has achieved great success in various sports, such as badminton, table tennis, and swimming, and these achievements have helped to boost the country's national pride and identity.",
      "Lastly, sports and recreational activities are important for the physical and mental well-being of Singapore's residents. With a fast-paced and stressful lifestyle, it is essential for people to engage in physical activities that can help to reduce stress and improve their overall health. Sports and recreational activities provide an opportunity for people to unwind, relax, and engage in physical activities that can improve their physical and mental well-being.",
      "In conclusion, sports and recreational activities play a crucial role in shaping the social landscape and identity of a city-state like Singapore. They bring people together, foster a sense of community, are an integral part of Singapore's identity, and are important for the physical and mental well-being of its residents."

Geographically, Asia is no more a continent than is Europe. \u201cAsia\u201d itself is not even an Asian idea: Europeans invented it. Asians did not conceive of themselves as being part of a single continental entity. The region is too vast and diverse for that to have been possible.",
      "It still is. What is happening is rather a global rebalancing, as the historically brief but world-changing domination over humanity of Europe and its colonial progeny dwindles away. A multipolar and messy world will replace it. Will \u201cAsia\u201d make up a huge part of this? Certainly. China and India will be actors. But Asia is rather an arena than an actor.",
      "Look at a globe: Europe and Asia are one continent. For historical and cultural reasons, it also makes sense to include north Africa in Asia, rather than Africa. This then is Eurasia, the continent of the long-lasting human civilisations. Historically, this supercontinent was home to Confucian civilisation to the east, Hindu civilisation to the south, Islamic civilisation in the near west and Christendom in the far west. To the north were the steppe nomads. The interactions among these neighbours were profound. But Eurasia was too vast to be, or to be conceived of as, a unity.",
      "The Greeks appear to have invented the idea of dividing this single continent into two. The name is first attested in Herodotus, in about 440BC. At that time, nobody knew quite how vast what he called Asia was.",
      "The British historian John Hale argues that the name \u201cEurope\u201d also replaced \u201cChristendom\u201d during the Renaissance. With Europe imagined as a separate continent, Asia was the name for the vast and diverse areas to the east. But only in the past few centuries did economic, technological and military change give Europe and its offshoots domination. The distinction between Europe and Asia became real in terms of military conquests and extraordinary gaps in wealth.",
      "The late British economist Angus Maddison argued that, in 1820, the real gross domestic product per head of Western Europe was a little over double that of East Asia. By 1950, the ratio had soared to 6.5 times. But, by 2018, it had fallen back to just 2.4 times, almost where it was two centuries ago.",
      "In 1820, Asia generated 61 per cent of world output, while Western Europe generated only 25 per cent. By 1950, the Asian share had collapsed to a mere 20 per cent, while Western Europe\u2019s had reached 26 per cent. By 2018, however, Western Europe\u2019s share was down to 15 per cent, while Asia\u2019s had recovered all the way back to 48 per cent.",
      "Eurasia has rebalanced quite a bit. What about its weight in the world? Over the past two centuries, it declined, as output jumped in the Americas and populations also jumped there and in sub-Saharan Africa. But Eurasia remains the heartland of humanity. The share of the population of Eurasia in the world total was still 72 per cent in 2018, albeit down from 91 in 1820. Similarly, its share in global output was 70 per cent, down from 92 per cent in 1820 (with much of the rest, inevitably, in North America).",
      "The big story then is of the recovery of what we call Asia, led by east Asia, from its steep relative economic decline in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In the process, Eurasia has substantially rebalanced and so, quite naturally, has the world as a whole. This \u201cgreat convergence\u201d is also not due to some uniquely \u201cAsian\u201d culture. The very different cultures of Asia, and especially of east and south Asia, have embraced what one might consider European notions: competitive markets, free enterprise, liberal trade, education and the goal of economic growth.",
      "Precise packages vary. They depend on the histories and political cultures of specific societies. China and India, for example, are extraordinarily different from each other. But many of these societies do share a desire for more prosperous lives. Yet this is not by any means uniquely Asian. It is universal. What is a little less so, alas, is the ability to organise societies in ways that make the achievement possible. There is no doubt that over the past decades, Asian societies, notably those of east Asia, have been hugely successful in this regard.",
      "It is not at all surprising that this catch-up by such a vast number of people generates huge opportunities for commerce among them, as the McKinsey Global Institute has noted. The creation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership around China (but without India) suggests this may develop faster, though it also underlines the almost inevitable centrality of China in any such process of integration.",
      "What then can we say about this rebalancing of Eurasia and so the world? The most important point is that it is natural. The extraordinary power enjoyed by Europeans and the United States, their potent progeny, is dwindling. Not surprisingly, what we call Asia, close to half of the human population and home to some of the world\u2019s historic civilisations, is leading the change. Barring catastrophes, this is also likely to continue. The world economy\u2019s centre of gravity is simply shifting east. Asia then will be hugely economically and politically important. But it will also have highly significant internal rivalries and difficulties of its own. There will be no collective Asian \u201cwill\u201d, other than for societies to pursue their own paths.",
      "Meanwhile, the West needs to get two contrasting thoughts into its collective head. First, it must deal with the world as it is. Second, it must defend the best of its values, notably democracy and individual freedom, regardless of what anybody else in the world thinks. Who, after all, supposed life would get easier?

    "close_book_answer": [
      "Parag Khanna defines \"Asia\" as a continent encompassing a vast and diverse range of cultures, societies, and economies. He argues that the traditional definition of Asia as a geographical region bounded by the Indian and Pacific oceans is too narrow and fails to capture the complex and dynamic nature of the continent. Khanna's definition of Asia is expansive and inclusive, encompassing not only the East Asian economic powerhouses of China, Japan, and South Korea, but also the Middle East, Central Asia, and South Asia.",
      "Khanna's definition of Asia is rooted in the idea of connectivity and interdependence. He argues that the countries of Asia are increasingly connected through trade, investment, and cultural exchange, and that these connections are shaping the future of the continent. Khanna's definition of Asia also emphasizes the role of history and culture in shaping the region's identity. He argues that the shared cultural and historical heritage of the countries of Asia provides a basis for cooperation and understanding that transcends political and economic differences.",
      "Overall, Khanna's definition of Asia emphasizes the diversity, complexity, and dynamism of the continent. He argues that a nuanced and inclusive understanding of Asia is essential for navigating the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century."

      "The term \"Eurasia\" has a significant historical and cultural significance. It refers to the vast landmass that spans from Europe to Asia, encompassing a diverse range of cultures, languages, and traditions.",
      "Historically, the concept of Eurasia has played a crucial role in shaping global politics and economics. The term was first coined by the German geographer Friedrich Ratzel in the late 19th century, who argued that the region was a single, cohesive unit that would dominate the world stage in the future. This idea was later adopted by Russian geopolitician Halford Mackinder, who argued that control of Eurasia would be crucial to global power.",
      "Culturally, the term \"Eurasia\" highlights the interconnectedness of the regions it encompasses. The area has a rich history of cultural exchange, with the Silk Road serving as a key conduit for the spread of ideas, goods, and technologies between East and West. This exchange has given rise to a diverse range of cultures and traditions, from the ancient civilizations of China and India to the modern nations of Europe and Russia.",
      "In conclusion, the term \"Eurasia\" has a complex and multifaceted historical and cultural significance. It represents a vast and diverse region that has played a crucial role in shaping global politics and economics, while also highlighting the interconnectedness of the cultures and traditions it encompasses."

      "The future is Asian, argues the respected analyst Parag Khanna. But this piece of conventional wisdom needs unwrapping. Geographically, Asia is no more a continent than is Europe. \u201cAsia\u201d itself is not even an Asian idea: Europeans invented it. Asians did not conceive of themselves as being part of a single continental entity. The region is too vast and diverse for that to have been possible.",
      "It still is. What is happening is rather a global rebalancing, as the historically brief but world-changing domination over humanity of Europe and its colonial progeny dwindles away. A multipolar and messy world will replace it. Will \u201cAsia\u201d make up a huge part of this? Certainly. China and India will be actors. But Asia is rather an arena than an actor.",
      "Look at a globe: Europe and Asia are one continent. For historical and cultural reasons, it also makes sense to include north Africa in Asia, rather than Africa. This then is Eurasia, the continent of the long-lasting human civilisations. Historically, this supercontinent was home to Confucian civilisation to the east, Hindu civilisation to the south, Islamic civilisation in the near west and Christendom in the far west. To the north were the steppe nomads. The interactions among these neighbours were profound. But Eurasia was too vast to be, or to be conceived of as, a unity.",
      "The Greeks appear to have invented the idea of dividing this single continent into two. The name is first attested in Herodotus, in about 440BC. At that time, nobody knew quite how vast what he called Asia was.",
      "The British historian John Hale argues that the name \u201cEurope\u201d also replaced \u201cChristendom\u201d during the Renaissance. With Europe imagined as a separate continent, Asia was the name for the vast and diverse areas to the east. But only in the past few centuries did economic, technological and military change give Europe and its offshoots domination. The distinction between Europe and Asia became real in terms of military conquests and extraordinary gaps in wealth.",
      "The late British economist Angus Maddison argued that, in 1820, the real gross domestic product per head of Western Europe was a little over double that of East Asia. By 1950, the ratio had soared to 6.5 times. But, by 2018, it had fallen back to just 2.4 times, almost where it was two centuries ago.",
      "In 1820, Asia generated 61 per cent of world output, while Western Europe generated only 25 per cent. By 1950, the Asian share had collapsed to a mere 20 per cent, while Western Europe\u2019s had reached 26 per cent. By 2018, however, Western Europe\u2019s share was down to 15 per cent, while Asia\u2019s had recovered all the way back to 48 per cent.",
      "Eurasia has rebalanced quite a bit. What about its weight in the world? Over the past two centuries, it declined, as output jumped in the Americas and populations also jumped there and in sub-Saharan Africa. But Eurasia remains the heartland of humanity. The share of the population of Eurasia in the world total was still 72 per cent in 2018, albeit down from 91 in 1820. Similarly, its share in global output was 70 per cent, down from 92 per cent in 1820 (with much of the rest, inevitably, in North America).",
      "The big story then is of the recovery of what we call Asia, led by east Asia, from its steep relative economic decline in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In the process, Eurasia has substantially rebalanced and so, quite naturally, has the world as a whole. This \u201cgreat convergence\u201d is also not due to some uniquely \u201cAsian\u201d culture. The very different cultures of Asia, and especially of east and south Asia, have embraced what one might consider European notions: competitive markets, free enterprise, liberal trade, education and the goal of economic growth.",
      "Precise packages vary. They depend on the histories and political cultures of specific societies. China and India, for example, are extraordinarily different from each other. But many of these societies do share a desire for more prosperous lives. Yet this is not by any means uniquely Asian. It is universal. What is a little less so, alas, is the ability to organise societies in ways that make the achievement possible. There is no doubt that over the past decades, Asian societies, notably those of east Asia, have been hugely successful in this regard.",
      "It is not at all surprising that this catch-up by such a vast number of people generates huge opportunities for commerce among them, as the McKinsey Global Institute has noted. The creation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership around China (but without India) suggests this may develop faster, though it also underlines the almost inevitable centrality of China in any such process of integration.",
      "What then can we say about this rebalancing of Eurasia and so the world? The most important point is that it is natural. The extraordinary power enjoyed by Europeans and the United States, their potent progeny, is dwindling. Not surprisingly, what we call Asia, close to half of the human population and home to some of the world\u2019s historic civilisations, is leading the change. Barring catastrophes, this is also likely to continue. The world economy\u2019s centre of gravity is simply shifting east. Asia then will be hugely economically and politically important. But it will also have highly significant internal rivalries and difficulties of its own. There will be no collective Asian \u201cwill\u201d, other than for societies to pursue their own paths.",
      "Meanwhile, the West needs to get two contrasting thoughts into its collective head. First, it must deal with the world as it is. Second, it must defend the best of its values, notably democracy and individual freedom, regardless of what anybody else in the world thinks. Who, after all, supposed life would get easier?

    "question": "5. What is the \"great convergence\" and how has it affected Eurasia and the world as a whole?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The \"great convergence\" refers to the phenomenon of the rapid growth of the economies of several countries, particularly in Asia, over the past few decades. This growth has been fueled by factors such as increased trade, foreign investment, and the adoption of market-oriented economic policies. The result has been a significant narrowing of the economic gap between developed and developing countries.",
      "The effects of the great convergence have been particularly pronounced in Eurasia, which is home to many of the countries that have experienced the most rapid economic growth. For example, China, India, and Vietnam have all seen their economies grow at an impressive rate, leading to significant improvements in the standard of living for millions of people.",
      "The great convergence has also had a significant impact on the world as a whole. It has led to a more interconnected and interdependent global economy, with increased trade and investment between countries. This has led to a number of benefits, such as increased economic growth and job creation, as well as a greater diversification of products and services available to consumers.",
      "However, the great convergence has also led to some challenges, such as increased competition for resources and markets, as well as concerns about the environmental and social impact of rapid economic growth. Additionally, the great convergence has also highlighted the persistence of income inequality within and between countries, as well as the need for more inclusive and sustainable economic growth."
