      "I never got to know my father well. He died suddenly when I was nine. He was only 44.",
      "Although I didn\u2019t have much time with him, I have fond memories of my boyhood days. And on Father\u2019s Day every year, I look at his photograph, say a little prayer for him, and thank him for all that he gave me during our brief time together.",
      "I grew up in Klang, a city in Selangor in Malaysia, where my father worked as a civil servant. After his death, my mother, older brother and I moved to Singapore where my uncle gave us a place to live. We lived modestly, with my father\u2019s government pension and financial help from my uncle. There was no money for extras.",
      "It was the absence of my father that marked my days back then. I missed how he doted on my brother and me, how he came home with presents and took us out to the movies. Most of all, I missed how he answered all our endless questions, which came easy for him as he had encyclopaedic knowledge.",
      "What I remember most are the lessons he taught me that have guided me throughout my growing-up years and shaped my personality.",
      "As a young boy, I took my father\u2019s words as gospel truth and the advice he gave as gold, holding them close to my heart.",
      "The biggest lesson has to be the \u201c272-steps lesson\u201d.",
      "When I was around six years old, our family visited the Batu Caves Hindu temple near Kuala Lumpur. The mouth of Batu Caves was at the top of numerous and steep steps. When my father said there were 272 steps, I told him I would not make it all the way to the top.",
      "His reply gave me the motivation to go for it: Getting to the top was just a matter of taking 16 steps to reach a landing, then another 16 steps to get to the next one, and if I kept going from one landing to another, I would reach the caves.",
      "And so we climbed \u2013 my father holding my hand and both of us counting the steps out loud until we reached the caves.",
      "The lesson learnt: Don\u2019t be daunted by a big problem, as it can be tackled by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts.",
      "I applied this lesson throughout my life \u2013 breaking a task into smaller steps, stages and sequences to eventually get it done. This approach to problem-solving has stood me in good stead in my personal and professional life.",
      "When I was 45, I made a mid-career switch from stockbroking to journalism, joining CNA as a business reporter. As I knew little about TV production, I applied what my father taught me \u2013 do things in steps, stages and sequences. In time, with training and learning on the job, I became a senior editor of the station\u2019s business programme.",
      "Another lesson I learnt from my father was foundation-building. I remember as a child stacking building blocks, putting a square or round piece on top of another to see how high I could build the tower before the whole structure came crashing down.",
      "My first few attempts collapsed in double-quick time. After seeing my failed attempts, my father showed me how I needed to build a strong foundation in order to get taller towers. I should not rush it, and take care to align the pieces to get a more stable structure.",
      "I followed his advice, and my towers stood tall and did not collapse.",
      "Building strong foundations became an integral part of everything I did in life. I was always well prepared before an examination, I trained hard before running a marathon, and I researched extensively before covering a news event.",
      "My father also made sure he built a strong foundation in the education of his two sons. When we turned three, he introduced us to the alphabet, taught us numbers and read books to us to build up our vocabulary. He made us do simple sums and memorise the multiplication table.",
      "On our family trips to other towns in Malaysia, my father would make us solve mental maths problems. To keep us occupied during the long drives, he asked us to work out how long it would take to get to the destination based on the speed of the car and the distance left to go.",
      "There were also memory games, such as naming the capital cities of countries and the dates of historical events.",
      "We went to the library regularly to borrow books, and he bought junior encyclopaedias to help us improve our general knowledge. He helped us with homework and reminded us to always go beyond what we learnt in school.",
      "I grew up loving books and studied English literature in school. I developed a passion for writing and published two novels.",
      "My father was a kind-hearted and generous man. He gave to charities readily and lent money to his cash-strapped colleagues. Our barber, who needed money for his family in India, borrowed from my father, who never asked for the loan to be repaid.",
      "He talked to us about faith, and most importantly, showed us through his actions the importance of living life with honesty and integrity.",
      "He told me never to take what was not mine at times when I found things. When I was a Scout in school, he reminded me during Job Week that I should do my best, as I was getting paid for the work. He told me he always gave his all, for the organisations he worked in and the people he worked with.",
      "Of course, my father had his weaknesses. He loved food too much, often overate and rarely exercised. As he was only in his 40s when he died from typhoid fever, I have always wondered if he could have recovered from the bacterial infection if he had taken better care of his health.",
      "My father could also be indecisive and lacked composure. I remember an incident when a beehive at the back of our house fell to the ground, and my father ran for cover from the swarm of bees. My mother\u2019s quick thinking in setting the hive on fire saved the day.",
      "Despite his shortcomings and his brief time with us, he had a lasting impact on our lives. I would like to think that he had a hand in the success story of my brother, who rose through the ranks to become a rear-admiral in the Singapore Navy and was Chief of Navy before he retired.",
      "Although I do not have children of my own, I do have advice for all the fathers out there \u2013 teach your children well, as what you say will leave an indelible impression and stay with them for the rest of their lives. Just like how my father\u2019s words and wise counsel have guided me through mine.",
      "So this Father\u2019s Day, I will gaze upon the photo of my dad, and thank him for making me who I am today."

      "I never got to know my father well. He died suddenly when I was nine. He was only 44.",
      "Although I didn\u2019t have much time with him, I have fond memories of my boyhood days. And on Father\u2019s Day every year, I look at his photograph, say a little prayer for him, and thank him for all that he gave me during our brief time together.",
      "I grew up in Klang, a city in Selangor in Malaysia, where my father worked as a civil servant. After his death, my mother, older brother and I moved to Singapore where my uncle gave us a place to live. We lived modestly, with my father\u2019s government pension and financial help from my uncle. There was no money for extras.",
      "It was the absence of my father that marked my days back then. I missed how he doted on my brother and me, how he came home with presents and took us out to the movies. Most of all, I missed how he answered all our endless questions, which came easy for him as he had encyclopaedic knowledge.",
      "What I remember most are the lessons he taught me that have guided me throughout my growing-up years and shaped my personality.",
      "As a young boy, I took my father\u2019s words as gospel truth and the advice he gave as gold, holding them close to my heart.",
      "The biggest lesson has to be the \u201c272-steps lesson\u201d.",
      "When I was around six years old, our family visited the Batu Caves Hindu temple near Kuala Lumpur. The mouth of Batu Caves was at the top of numerous and steep steps. When my father said there were 272 steps, I told him I would not make it all the way to the top.",
      "His reply gave me the motivation to go for it: Getting to the top was just a matter of taking 16 steps to reach a landing, then another 16 steps to get to the next one, and if I kept going from one landing to another, I would reach the caves.",
      "And so we climbed \u2013 my father holding my hand and both of us counting the steps out loud until we reached the caves.",
      "The lesson learnt: Don\u2019t be daunted by a big problem, as it can be tackled by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts.",
      "I applied this lesson throughout my life \u2013 breaking a task into smaller steps, stages and sequences to eventually get it done. This approach to problem-solving has stood me in good stead in my personal and professional life.",
      "When I was 45, I made a mid-career switch from stockbroking to journalism, joining CNA as a business reporter. As I knew little about TV production, I applied what my father taught me \u2013 do things in steps, stages and sequences. In time, with training and learning on the job, I became a senior editor of the station\u2019s business programme.",
      "Another lesson I learnt from my father was foundation-building. I remember as a child stacking building blocks, putting a square or round piece on top of another to see how high I could build the tower before the whole structure came crashing down.",
      "My first few attempts collapsed in double-quick time. After seeing my failed attempts, my father showed me how I needed to build a strong foundation in order to get taller towers. I should not rush it, and take care to align the pieces to get a more stable structure.",
      "I followed his advice, and my towers stood tall and did not collapse.",
      "Building strong foundations became an integral part of everything I did in life. I was always well prepared before an examination, I trained hard before running a marathon, and I researched extensively before covering a news event.",
      "My father also made sure he built a strong foundation in the education of his two sons. When we turned three, he introduced us to the alphabet, taught us numbers and read books to us to build up our vocabulary. He made us do simple sums and memorise the multiplication table.",
      "On our family trips to other towns in Malaysia, my father would make us solve mental maths problems. To keep us occupied during the long drives, he asked us to work out how long it would take to get to the destination based on the speed of the car and the distance left to go.",
      "There were also memory games, such as naming the capital cities of countries and the dates of historical events.",
      "We went to the library regularly to borrow books, and he bought junior encyclopaedias to help us improve our general knowledge. He helped us with homework and reminded us to always go beyond what we learnt in school.",
      "I grew up loving books and studied English literature in school. I developed a passion for writing and published two novels.",
      "My father was a kind-hearted and generous man. He gave to charities readily and lent money to his cash-strapped colleagues. Our barber, who needed money for his family in India, borrowed from my father, who never asked for the loan to be repaid.",
      "He talked to us about faith, and most importantly, showed us through his actions the importance of living life with honesty and integrity.",
      "He told me never to take what was not mine at times when I found things. When I was a Scout in school, he reminded me during Job Week that I should do my best, as I was getting paid for the work. He told me he always gave his all, for the organisations he worked in and the people he worked with.",
      "Of course, my father had his weaknesses. He loved food too much, often overate and rarely exercised. As he was only in his 40s when he died from typhoid fever, I have always wondered if he could have recovered from the bacterial infection if he had taken better care of his health.",

      "The horse racing fraternity has reacted with dismay to the Government\u2019s recent decision to close the Singapore Turf Club (STC) in Kranji.",
      "This will mean the end of the 180-year-old sport in Singapore and the loss of hundreds of jobs. It also leaves horse owners, jockeys and the horses themselves facing an uncertain future.",
      "Despite the sympathy for STC\u2019s employees, the 120ha of land freed up by the club\u2019s closure opens up many possibilities for other urgent land use requirements.",
      "Put simply, one key aim of land use planning is to use any given piece of land to bring the most benefits to the most people.",
      "With local horse racing experiencing declining spectatorship over the years, it makes sense to redevelop the land on which the STC sits to meet urgent housing demand, especially for public housing.",
      "The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has indicated that planning for the site will take two or three years. Beyond the housing, leisure and recreation uses already announced, it is too early to speculate what else might come up on the land.",
      "However, there are hints about how government agencies plan to approach the site.",
      "A spokesman for the URA has noted that Singapore\u2019s northern region as a whole is very \u201cgreen\u201d and that the authority would take the surrounding context into account.",
      "The surrounding physical context includes the Mandai Mangrove and Mudflat Nature Park to the north, and the Kranji Reservoir, Kranji Coastal Nature Park and Kranji Marshes to the north-east and east. The Rail Corridor is also just north of the STC site.",
      "Beyond physical factors, general attitudes towards greenery have evolved over the years.",
      "Indeed, it was reported earlier in June in The Straits Times that a study by the National University of Singapore (NUS) Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions quantified what I had long noticed among my own friends and acquaintances \u2013 that Singaporeans value views of greenery enough to pay a premium for them.",
      "This means we have moved beyond equating greenery only with formal parks or nature areas.",
      "The Rail Corridor, for example, is a green leisure and recreation space for daytime joggers and walkers, but also doubles as a route for cyclists going to work, and a linkway for wildlife connectivity at night.",
      "The Clementi Nature Corridor announced by the National Parks Board in July 2021 as an ecological connection between Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and the Southern Ridges, and the 400ha Sungei Buloh Nature Park Network, are emblematic of the Government\u2019s current science-based approach to managing the balance between nature conservation and development needs.",
      "In that regard, beyond parks and landscaped greenery, there could be an opportunity for incorporating nature corridors in any new town at the STC site to improve the ecological links between existing nature areas around Kranji.",
      "The recent NUS study also noted that the area of greenery per person within residential towns declined from 17.7 sq m to 13.7 sq m from 2008 to 2020. Given the premium we place on it, I believe most Singaporeans would welcome it if we could add to the amount of greenery in Singapore.",
      "According to news reports, URA has not ruled out the possibility of retaining some STC structures if it makes sense to keep or repurpose them for other uses.",
      "Adaptive re-use of existing buildings was in the news recently when The Business Times reported London-based environmental engineer Patrick Bellew and Singapore building experts arguing that in terms of embodied carbon, it is not environmentally sustainable to demolish buildings and rebuild them.",
      "Embodied carbon refers to the greenhouse gases that are released when building materials are made, transported and assembled. According to Mr Bellew, even for \u201csuper green\u201d buildings, embodied carbon constitutes about 80 per cent of the carbon emissions in the first 50 years of a building\u2019s lifespan.",
      "In other words, no matter how environmentally sustainable a building is when operational, a lot of its carbon emissions had already been expended during its construction and early years.",
      "Adaptive re-use of existing buildings would help negate the excessive carbon emissions inherent in the demolish-and-rebuild model.",
      "With the STC now about 25 years old, its buildings are good candidates for adaptive re-use as they are unlikely to be near the end of their structural lifespan.",
      "In fact, there are precedents overseas of sporting stadiums being repurposed for housing and other uses.",
      "One example is the old Highbury stadium, the home of Arsenal Football Club for 93 years until 2006. The stadium was converted into apartments for the new Highbury Square development.",
      "In the American city of Indianapolis, the 80-year-old grandstand of the historic Bush baseball stadium was converted into an apartment complex known as Stadium Lofts, which opened in 2013.",
      "This, of course, does not necessarily mean that a different building, like STC\u2019s grandstand, can be similarly repurposed.",
      "Would retaining the grandstand unacceptably constrain the development potential and spatial planning of the rest of the site? Is the building suitable to be repurposed for the uses being considered, and would the effort be prohibitively expensive or too time-consuming to be practical?",
      "These are tough questions and hard economics, and pragmatism may render adaptive re-use of the grandstand unfeasible.",
      "However, there is value in considering the preservation of the intangible social memory of horse racing\u2019s long history in Singapore once it is gone, and honouring those who were part of it.",

The closure of the Turf Club is also related to a broader decline in interest in horse racing, with falling attendance and viewership in the US and Singapore. In India, there is a debate about converting Mumbai\u2019s Mahalaxmi Race Course into a central park, while the Folkestone Racecourse in the UK was recently approved for redevelopment into a sustainability-focused town development."

      "But effective urban planning is necessary to ensure that the nation\u2019s land use needs are met. This often requires our urban planners to redevelop existing plots of land to create space for new developments.",
      "What are the key considerations that determine which buildings or sites are to be conserved and which are to be redeveloped? How can our urban planners continue to ensure that Singapore\u2019s land use needs are fulfilled while at the same time retaining our heritage?",
      "This ongoing tension arose again with recent announcements that the Singapore Turf Club would cease its racing operations at Kranji. The 120ha Kranji site will be returned to the Government and redeveloped for housing and other needs.",
      "The move will free up much-needed land to address our urgent needs for more housing and commercial spaces.",
      "Considering the 180-year history of horse racing in Singapore, it is by no means an easy decision. But there are several factors that make this necessary.",
      "Closing the racecourse will support the development of a northern economic hub known as Woodlands Regional Centre, a plan that had already been articulated in the Housing Board\u2019s (HDB) 2017 Remaking Our Heartland programme.",
      "Such efforts to create regional business hubs are also part of the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)\u2019s \u201cLocal Hubs, Global Gateways\u201d strategy which aims to provide more commercial space outside the Central Business District (CBD).",
      "According to real estate consultancy Knight Frank, office rents in the CBD rose in the first quarter of 2023, driven by a combination of tight supply and strong demand.",
      "Singapore is also facing high demand for housing, which has translated into rising home prices and rents. In the first quarter of 2023, private home prices rose by 3.3 per cent while those of resale HDB flats rose by 0.9 per cent.",
      "As the space needs of Singapore\u2019s residents and its industries continue to grow, it will become necessary to redevelop existing sites to build more housing estates, innovation parks, satellite business districts and other projects.",
      "Besides driving urban redevelopment, the URA is also in charge of conserving historically significant buildings. According to the authority, conservation requires an appreciation and understanding of the architecture and structure of historic buildings, with the aim of retaining their inherent spirit and original ambience.",
      "Considerations for whether to conserve a building therefore involve the historical significance of the building, its architectural merit, as well as the original ambience of the building.",
      "The recent gazetting of Golden Mile Complex as a conserved building is a good case in point, given its post-independence modernist Brutalist style of architecture and popularity as a mixed-use development.",
      "However, given Singapore\u2019s land constraints and urgent land-use needs, it will be increasingly difficult to justify the conservation of buildings and facilities that occupy large plots of land.",
      "At 120ha, the Kranji Turf Club is almost four times the size of Dover Forest (33ha) and more than double the size of Keppel Club (48ha). Both of those sites have been slated for redevelopment into housing estates.",
      "While critics of the Dover Forest redevelopment suggested building flats on existing vacant sites, housing estates are in reality developed as an integrated whole.",
      "This means that housing estates need to include not only homes but also transport infrastructure, schools, markets, food outlets and medical facilities, requiring large plots of land rather than random pockets of space.",
      "The impetus for the Turf Club\u2019s closure is also related to a broader decline of interest in horse racing.",
      "According to a report from The Economist, horse racing viewership and attendance have been decreasing rapidly in the United States, pushed by declining interest in the sport as well as the proliferation of alternative gambling venues like casinos.",
      "In Singapore, horse racing average attendance has fallen from 6,000 per day in 2019 to current levels of 2,600 per day.",
      "Beyond its size, a racecourse is also a highly specialised facility that is designed to provide space for the care, training and racing of horses.",
      "At the Singapore Turf Club, there are multiple tracks for different race types and training purposes, racing and resting stables to accommodate horses, and an equine pool for training purposes. There are also a grandstand and carparks for accommodating spectators on race days.",
      "It will not be easy to convert such facilities for residential and commercial uses, nor will it be an optimal use of space and resources.",
      "It is possible that for the same reasons, other countries have considered closure of their horse racing tracks.",
      "In India, there is an ongoing debate about converting Mumbai\u2019s Mahalaxmi Race Course into a central park.",
      "In the United Kingdom, the Folkestone Racecourse in the county of Kent was closed in 2012 and recently approved for redevelopment into Otterpool Park Garden Town. This is a sustainability-focused town development that will provide housing, business premises and recreational facilities.",
      "In both instances, the demolishment (or proposed demolishment) of a racecourse frees up space for building homes and green spaces.",
      "In cases where large sports venues are conserved in the past, these often involved sports that continue to enjoy strong interest and viewership.",
      "Such venues include Berlin\u2019s Olympiastadion, which was a stadium built for the 1936 summer Olympics that is now used for international football matches.",
      "In Athens, there is the Panathenaic Stadium which was built around 330 BC. It has gone through refurbishments over the course of its history and remains in use as an Olympics venue.",
      "Given space constraints, Singapore will often face difficult trade-offs between urban redevelopment and conservation.",
      "This is further complicated by the fact that both are emotionally charged issues that matter a great deal to many.",
      "While it is important to conserve buildings and spaces that hold special meaning or memories for their users, there is also an urgent need to ensure sufficient housing and commercial spaces.",
      "Both are critical for the population."

As Julie Beck, senior editor of the family section at The Atlantic observes, unlike the close-knit core friendships that those in their teens and 20s tend to forge and rely on, priorities change quite drastically later in life.",

Back in the day, we were really close, sometimes egging each other on to defy our well-meaning teachers and then, when push came to shove, pulling all-nighters together to study for examinations.",

In fact, a recent study found that people often feel just as hurt at being ghosted by a friend as they do with a romantic partner.",

For, as a report from the Treasury\u2019s little-known Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee (FBIIC) declared earlier in 2023, regulators are getting nervous about the systemic financial risks emanating from the cloud.

      "There are at least three big issues to consider. The first is the speed of change in computing practices. The FBIIC report notes that more than 90 per cent of the members of the American Bankers Association are shifting activity on to the cloud, although more than 80 per cent say this is at an early stage. Since a separate survey suggests that two-thirds of banks expect at least 30 per cent of their activities to be cloud-based in the next three years, the FBIIC calculates that cloud usage will triple by then.

A distributed model is supposed to be more resilient.",
      "But one bitter irony of finance is that innovations which purport to reduce risk by distributing it can sometimes also concentrate it in new, surprising and half-hidden ways. Consider credit.

The study analyzed data from over 2 million people in the UK and found that those who had taken antibiotics were more likely to develop Parkinson's disease. The study suggests that antibiotics may disrupt the balance of bacteria in the gut, leading to inflammation and the development of Parkinson's disease.\n\nOutput: A new study has found a link between antibiotic use and Parkinson's disease.

The system uses cameras and sensors to gather data on people's movements, facial expressions, and other behaviors. The AI algorithms then analyze this data to identify patterns and predict future behavior.\n\nOutput: The technology has potential applications in areas such as public safety, traffic management, and marketing. By analyzing patterns of behavior, it could help identify potential security threats or traffic congestion issues. In marketing, it could be used to analyze consumer behavior and preferences to improve targeted advertising. However, there are also concerns about privacy and the potential misuse of the technology.I'm sorry, but I need more information to provide a meaningful response.

The system uses cameras and sensors to gather data on people's movements, facial expressions, and other behaviors. The AI algorithms then analyze this data to identify patterns and predict future behavior.\n\nOutput: The technology has potential applications in areas such as public safety, traffic management, and marketing. By analyzing patterns of behavior, it could help identify potential security threats or traffic congestion issues. In marketing, it could be used to analyze consumer behavior and preferences to improve targeted advertising.

      "For more than a decade, the leadership of the World Bank has been riddled with controversy. The two most recent presidents, Dr Kim Jim Yong and Mr David Malpass, resigned before completing their full terms. Dr Kim, a physician who was appointed in 2012, presided over a chaotic reorganisation of the bank and lost the confidence of its staff, while Mr Malpass, a former Treasury department official from the Trump administration, was severely criticised by scientists, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and members of the US Congress for failing to address the climate crisis, and indeed, for being a climate denier.",
      "The World Bank now has a new president, Mr Ajay Banga, an American citizen of Indian origin. The United States is the largest shareholder of the World Bank and has always appointed its president, even though it has no formal mandate to do so.",
      "In recent years, developing countries \u2013 which make up the majority of the bank\u2019s clients \u2013 NGOs, former senior bank officials and even the bank\u2019s staff association have been lobbying for the bank to be led by someone other than an American male. One of their arguments is that since promoting development is the core mission of the bank, its leader should be drawn from among candidates from developing countries who have experience and expertise in tackling development-related challenges.",
      "The Biden administration has finessed the issue by choosing Mr Banga, who was born and educated in India, and has extensive international experience, having worked with multinational enterprises, including Nestle, Citibank, and more recently, Mastercard, where he was chief executive \u2013 at each of which, his achievements were impressive. As a consummate financial manager, a champion of diversity, a supporter of climate activism and well-versed in many of the challenges facing the developing world, he has been cautiously welcomed by the bank\u2019s stakeholders, notwithstanding the fact that he is yet another American male.",
      "Mr Banga will have his work cut out. He takes charge at a time of slowing global growth, deepening poverty in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, a serious debt crisis in the developing world, and more frequent climate shocks. He has pledged to leverage the bank\u2019s balance sheet to catalyse additional finance from partners, including other multilateral lenders, the private sector and NGOs. In addition, he would need to orchestrate a capital increase for the bank as well as governance reforms to ensure developing countries have a bigger say in its operations and priorities.",
      "He deserves all possible support from the bank\u2019s stakeholders. But they should not let up on their mission to ensure that the leadership of the bank is truly merit-based, internationally sourced and not a continuing monopoly of the US."

The system uses cameras and sensors to gather data on people's movements, facial expressions, and other behaviors. The AI algorithms then analyze this data to identify patterns and predict future behavior.\n\nOutput: The technology has potential applications in areas such as public safety, traffic management, and marketing. By analyzing patterns of behavior, it could help identify potential security threats or traffic congestion issues. In marketing, it could be used to analyze consumer behavior and preferences to improve targeted advertising. However, there are also concerns about privacy and the potential misuse of the technology.I'm sorry, but I need more information to provide a meaningful response.

      "For more than a decade, the leadership of the World Bank has been riddled with controversy. The two most recent presidents, Dr Kim Jim Yong and Mr David Malpass, resigned before completing their full terms. Dr Kim, a physician who was appointed in 2012, presided over a chaotic reorganisation of the bank and lost the confidence of its staff, while Mr Malpass, a former Treasury department official from the Trump administration, was severely criticised by scientists, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and members of the US Congress for failing to address the climate crisis, and indeed, for being a climate denier.",
      "The World Bank now has a new president, Mr Ajay Banga, an American citizen of Indian origin. The United States is the largest shareholder of the World Bank and has always appointed its president, even though it has no formal mandate to do so.",
      "In recent years, developing countries \u2013 which make up the majority of the bank\u2019s clients \u2013 NGOs, former senior bank officials and even the bank\u2019s staff association have been lobbying for the bank to be led by someone other than an American male. One of their arguments is that since promoting development is the core mission of the bank, its leader should be drawn from among candidates from developing countries who have experience and expertise in tackling development-related challenges.",
      "The Biden administration has finessed the issue by choosing Mr Banga, who was born and educated in India, and has extensive international experience, having worked with multinational enterprises, including Nestle, Citibank, and more recently, Mastercard, where he was chief executive \u2013 at each of which, his achievements were impressive. As a consummate financial manager, a champion of diversity, a supporter of climate activism and well-versed in many of the challenges facing the developing world, he has been cautiously welcomed by the bank\u2019s stakeholders, notwithstanding the fact that he is yet another American male.",
      "Mr Banga will have his work cut out. He takes charge at a time of slowing global growth, deepening poverty in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, a serious debt crisis in the developing world, and more frequent climate shocks. He has pledged to leverage the bank\u2019s balance sheet to catalyse additional finance from partners, including other multilateral lenders, the private sector and NGOs. In addition, he would need to orchestrate a capital increase for the bank as well as governance reforms to ensure developing countries have a bigger say in its operations and priorities.",
      "He deserves all possible support from the bank\u2019s stakeholders. But they should not let up on their mission to ensure that the leadership of the bank is truly merit-based, internationally sourced and not a continuing monopoly of the US."

The system uses cameras and sensors to gather data on people's movements, facial expressions, and other behaviors. The AI algorithms then analyze this data to identify patterns and predict future behavior.\n\nOutput: The technology has potential applications in areas such as public safety, traffic management, and marketing. By analyzing patterns of behavior, it could help identify potential security threats or traffic congestion issues. In marketing, it could be used to analyze consumer behavior and preferences to improve targeted advertising.

The system uses cameras and sensors to gather data on people's movements, facial expressions, and other behaviors. The AI algorithms then analyze this data to identify patterns and predict future behavior.\n\nOutput: The technology has potential applications in areas such as public safety, traffic management, and marketing. By analyzing patterns of behavior, it could help identify potential security threats or traffic congestion issues. In marketing, it could be used to analyze consumer behavior and preferences to improve targeted advertising.

The system uses cameras and sensors to gather data on people's movements, facial expressions, and other behaviors. The AI algorithms then analyze this data to identify patterns and predict future behavior.\n\nOutput: The technology has potential applications in areas such as public safety, traffic management, and marketing. By analyzing patterns of behavior, it could help identify potential security threats or traffic congestion issues. In marketing, it could be used to analyze consumer behavior and preferences to improve targeted advertising. However, there are also concerns about privacy and the potential misuse of the technology.I'm sorry, but I need more information to provide a meaningful response.

      "For more than a decade, the leadership of the World Bank has been riddled with controversy. The two most recent presidents, Dr Kim Jim Yong and Mr David Malpass, resigned before completing their full terms. Dr Kim, a physician who was appointed in 2012, presided over a chaotic reorganisation of the bank and lost the confidence of its staff, while Mr Malpass, a former Treasury department official from the Trump administration, was severely criticised by scientists, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and members of the US Congress for failing to address the climate crisis, and indeed, for being a climate denier.",
      "The World Bank now has a new president, Mr Ajay Banga, an American citizen of Indian origin. The United States is the largest shareholder of the World Bank and has always appointed its president, even though it has no formal mandate to do so.",
      "In recent years, developing countries \u2013 which make up the majority of the bank\u2019s clients \u2013 NGOs, former senior bank officials and even the bank\u2019s staff association have been lobbying for the bank to be led by someone other than an American male. One of their arguments is that since promoting development is the core mission of the bank, its leader should be drawn from among candidates from developing countries who have experience and expertise in tackling development-related challenges.",
      "The Biden administration has finessed the issue by choosing Mr Banga, who was born and educated in India, and has extensive international experience, having worked with multinational enterprises, including Nestle, Citibank, and more recently, Mastercard, where he was chief executive \u2013 at each of which, his achievements were impressive. As a consummate financial manager, a champion of diversity, a supporter of climate activism and well-versed in many of the challenges facing the developing world, he has been cautiously welcomed by the bank\u2019s stakeholders, notwithstanding the fact that he is yet another American male.",
      "Mr Banga will have his work cut out. He takes charge at a time of slowing global growth, deepening poverty in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, a serious debt crisis in the developing world, and more frequent climate shocks. He has pledged to leverage the bank\u2019s balance sheet to catalyse additional finance from partners, including other multilateral lenders, the private sector and NGOs. In addition, he would need to orchestrate a capital increase for the bank as well as governance reforms to ensure developing countries have a bigger say in its operations and priorities.",
      "He deserves all possible support from the bank\u2019s stakeholders. But they should not let up on their mission to ensure that the leadership of the bank is truly merit-based, internationally sourced and not a continuing monopoly of the US."

      "It is extremely troubling that a recent study, conducted by Duke-NUS Medical School and the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), has suggested that anxiety and depression symptoms among people here could be costing Singapore nearly $16 billion a year, or about 2.9 per cent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product. This is so as a result of absenteeism, reduced productivity, and the use of healthcare resources. According to the researchers, this is the first study after the coronavirus pandemic that estimates the prevalence of, and quantifies the financial cost of, depression and anxiety symptoms among Singaporean adults. While the economic and social dislocation produced by Covid-19 expectedly produced a decline in mental health, what is worrying is that even the national recovery from that period of stress did not produce better results in the survey, which covered 5,725 Singaporeans above 21 years old between April and June 2022. Clearly, mental health is an issue that Singapore must grapple with urgently.",
      "The lesson to be drawn from the survey is the need to treat mental health on a par with physical health. Singapore possesses admirable assets by way of its hospitals, both public and private, its step-down care facilities, its polyclinics, its general practitioners, and its specialists. They cater to the physical well-being of residents in a way that justifies Singapore\u2019s reputation for First World healthcare. Mental health, too, is addressed by the IMH, private institutions and civil society organisations. However, the stigma attached traditionally to mental problems \u2013 in a way that does not affect those seeking medical care for physical ailments \u2013 deters many sufferers from seeking early and preventive care. As a result, they suffer in silence when there are avenues open for their treatment and rehabilitation. Some prefer to go into denial mode. Such attitudes should not exist in a mature society. People must understand that it is not morally reprehensible to be mentally unwell, any more than it is to be physically sick.",
      "It is reassuring that companies are stepping up efforts to help staff with mental health issues. Stress and burnout, to say nothing about anxiety and depression, are workplace ills that erode the human talent on which corporate success is based ultimately. Companies which treat staff under mental pressure with understanding and empathy are likely to have employees who are motivated because they feel valued. Sufferers, too, would come forward for help early because they would not fear being stigmatised by colleagues. More companies here are including mental wellness benefits in their corporate insurance coverage in a healthy sign of the times.",

      "For those who have followed the energy transition over the past few decades, there is one technology that is treated as much as a punchline as a serious industry: Carbon capture and storage, or CCS.",
      "A decade or so ago, many still thought it was the best hope for decarbonising the world\u2019s power systems. CCS was \u201cthe Google and Intel of the energy world\u201d, the Atlantic magazine declared in a 2010 cover story that predicted solar and wind would never get above 10 per cent of power supply.",
      "In the following decade, it was renewables that boomed while CCS went bust. Wind and solar accounted for 39 per cent of generation in Germany in the first quarter of 2023 and will hit 50 per cent over the full year in Spain. Meanwhile, only a handful of demonstration CCS plants went into operation \u2013 and one of the biggest was switched off in 2021 as oil prices plummeted, since it had been able to make money only from the decidedly dirty business of driving carbon dioxide into depleted oil wells to force out fresh crude.",
      "There are signs that CCS may be about to get the last laugh, though. In Britain, the government has promised as much as \u00a320 billion (S$33.9 billion) in spending to kick-start the sector. A tender to scope out sites that could store as much as 10 per cent of the country\u2019s emissions in old North Sea oilfields closed comfortably oversubscribed in May. In the Gulf of Mexico, ExxonMobil has spent about US$25 million (S$33.6 million) in two recent rounds bidding for nearly 170 blocks of depleted offshore acreage that might be able to store carbon from a planned hub in Houston, Texas. The world\u2019s first CCS project at a cement plant is slated to start in 2024 at a Heidelberg Materials facility in Norway.",
      "What\u2019s different now? In essence, a business that was always viable technologically has finally found an economic rationale. The problem with CCS was never that it did not work: Norway\u2019s Sleipner carbon capture project has been quietly pumping about 1 million tonnes annually under the North Sea for nearly 20 years since it was built to evade a 1991 carbon tax. Elsewhere in the world, however, there was no way to get paid.",
      "That has changed with the US Inflation Reduction Act and the surging value of the European Union\u2019s carbon permits. CCS does not really become viable anywhere south of US$70 a metric tonne, and until about 18 months ago the only countries putting a price on carbon at that level were in Scandinavia and the Alps.",
      "Since the start of 2022, however, European carbon has averaged US$89 a tonne, while the Biden administration\u2019s climate Bill has introduced an US$85/tonne tax credit for CCS. Roughly a third of the world economy has suddenly priced carbon dioxide (CO2) at a level where, in theory, there should be good money in locking it up underground.",
      "All the hype from the 2000s has cast a long shadow. CCS is still seen by many energy specialists as a pipe dream at best, and at worst a mendacious attempt to rebrand fossil fuels without doing the hard work of decarbonisation. The main end-use for which it was pitched a decade ago \u2013 power generation \u2013 has also been invalidated by the slumping costs of renewable power.",
      "Even if you exclude electricity, however, there is a big slice of industry where CCS could yet be crucial. Power generation accounts for about 40 per cent of the world\u2019s CO2 emissions, but another fifth comes from steel, cement and chemicals \u2013 and renewables are not well-suited to abating that pollution. Until technologies such as green steel and green hydrogen get up to speed and someone invents a viable way of making zero-carbon cement, we could use a functioning CCS sector to keep that CO2 out of the atmosphere.",
      "CCS has another benefit, too. The developed world\u2019s shift to a more aggressive decarbonisation pathway risks leaving many emerging economies stranded. Falling fossil fuel demand will kill off one of their main raw materials export industries, while carbon border taxes threaten future manufacturing sectors. A global carbon trade offers a solution to that problem, giving nations with the right geology the ability to make money from sequestering other people\u2019s carbon.",

      "For those who have followed the energy transition over the past few decades, there is one technology that is treated as much as a punchline as a serious industry: Carbon capture and storage, or CCS.",
      "A decade or so ago, many still thought it was the best hope for decarbonising the world\u2019s power systems. CCS was \u201cthe Google and Intel of the energy world\u201d, the Atlantic magazine declared in a 2010 cover story that predicted solar and wind would never get above 10 per cent of power supply.",
      "In the following decade, it was renewables that boomed while CCS went bust. Wind and solar accounted for 39 per cent of generation in Germany in the first quarter of 2023 and will hit 50 per cent over the full year in Spain. Meanwhile, only a handful of demonstration CCS plants went into operation \u2013 and one of the biggest was switched off in 2021 as oil prices plummeted, since it had been able to make money only from the decidedly dirty business of driving carbon dioxide into depleted oil wells to force out fresh crude.",
      "There are signs that CCS may be about to get the last laugh, though. In Britain, the government has promised as much as \u00a320 billion (S$33.9 billion) in spending to kick-start the sector. A tender to scope out sites that could store as much as 10 per cent of the country\u2019s emissions in old North Sea oilfields closed comfortably oversubscribed in May. In the Gulf of Mexico, ExxonMobil has spent about US$25 million (S$33.6 million) in two recent rounds bidding for nearly 170 blocks of depleted offshore acreage that might be able to store carbon from a planned hub in Houston, Texas. The world\u2019s first CCS project at a cement plant is slated to start in 2024 at a Heidelberg Materials facility in Norway.",
      "What\u2019s different now? In essence, a business that was always viable technologically has finally found an economic rationale. The problem with CCS was never that it did not work: Norway\u2019s Sleipner carbon capture project has been quietly pumping about 1 million tonnes annually under the North Sea for nearly 20 years since it was built to evade a 1991 carbon tax. Elsewhere in the world, however, there was no way to get paid.",
      "That has changed with the US Inflation Reduction Act and the surging value of the European Union\u2019s carbon permits. CCS does not really become viable anywhere south of US$70 a metric tonne, and until about 18 months ago the only countries putting a price on carbon at that level were in Scandinavia and the Alps.",
      "Since the start of 2022, however, European carbon has averaged US$89 a tonne, while the Biden administration\u2019s climate Bill has introduced an US$85/tonne tax credit for CCS. Roughly a third of the world economy has suddenly priced carbon dioxide (CO2) at a level where, in theory, there should be good money in locking it up underground.",
      "All the hype from the 2000s has cast a long shadow. CCS is still seen by many energy specialists as a pipe dream at best, and at worst a mendacious attempt to rebrand fossil fuels without doing the hard work of decarbonisation. The main end-use for which it was pitched a decade ago \u2013 power generation \u2013 has also been invalidated by the slumping costs of renewable power.",
      "Even if you exclude electricity, however, there is a big slice of industry where CCS could yet be crucial. Power generation accounts for about 40 per cent of the world\u2019s CO2 emissions, but another fifth comes from steel, cement and chemicals \u2013 and renewables are not well-suited to abating that pollution. Until technologies such as green steel and green hydrogen get up to speed and someone invents a viable way of making zero-carbon cement, we could use a functioning CCS sector to keep that CO2 out of the atmosphere.",

The United States is the \u201cleader of the free world\u201d. The two countries see themselves as mature democracies; models that other nations can emulate.",

      "The film quickly became a must-see event, and audiences were left amazed by the spectacle of seeing believable dinosaurs grace the big screen for the first time. Jurassic Park not only made giant leaps in special-effects film-making, but it also paved the way for myriad subsequent productions that featured beasts of all shapes and sizes.",
      "Jurassic Park originated in 1983 as a screenplay by author Michael Crichton, whose previous foray into film as writer and director of Westworld (1973) featured an immersive amusement park where androids malfunctioned and caused havoc. But his dinosaur-themed story first found publication as the novel Jurassic Park, which was released in 1990 and became a bestseller.",
      "That\u2019s when it came to the attention of Spielberg. By the early 1990s, Spielberg was no stranger to big-budget science-fiction film-making. The likes of Jaws (1975), Close Encounters Of The Third Kind (1977), Raiders Of The Lost Ark (1981) and E. T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982) had demonstrated that he had a track record of making extremely successful effects-heavy but story-led films. That made Jurassic Park perfect for his next production.",
      "Spielberg\u2019s adaptation, written by Crichton and David Koepp, changed a number of aspects of the novel\u2019s ending to provide a satisfactory conclusion to the film, yet leave enough loose ends for further exploration in the franchise.",
      "Of course, Jurassic Park wasn\u2019t the first time dinosaurs had been featured on the big screen. 1933\u2019s King Kong is an early example of a film that pushed the boundaries of what was then possible by including sequences of the eponymous giant gorilla fighting with dinosaurs.",
      "Creatures were brought to life for cinemagoers by combining stop-motion animation with rear projection (where previously shot film is projected onto a backdrop and actors are recorded performing in front of it). Other feature films such as Journey To The Centre Of The Earth (1959), The Lost World (1960) and The Land That Time Forgot (1974) had attempted alternative ways of bringing dinosaurs to the screen, including puppetry and even fitting live reptiles with prosthetics.",
      "Of these methods, a combination of stop-motion animation for long shots and animatronic puppets for close-ups was initially chosen by Spielberg for Jurassic Park.",
      "Stop-motion tests produced good results, especially in the development of go-motion, a technique which blurred models to provide a sense of movement similar to that of live action.",
      "But Spielberg and his team were still keen to go further with what was possible. Dennis Muren from visual effects company Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) provided an alternative approach by using CGI modelling and animation.",
      "Off the back of pioneering CGI work in The Abyss (1989) and Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991), Muren and his team produced a test sequence of skeletal dinosaurs. Additional tests featuring a Tyrannosaurus rex with added skin further cemented the realisation that this was the way to go for the film. This technique built the model of the dinosaur from bones, added muscle and then, finally, the skin.",
      "It seemed the assembled stop-motion team had been made extinct by this innovative technology. However, the model-makers and animators were the experts on dinosaurs and their movement, and they retrained as computer animators to continue to use their skills on the production.",
      "Jurassic Park features 15 minutes of on-screen dinosaurs, of which approximately nine minutes feature Stan Winston\u2019s animatronics and six minutes feature ILM\u2019s CGI animation. The success of this combination is seen in the iconic T. rex attack scene. A number of animatronic shots feature close-ups of the T. rex before the full-height shots provide the creature\u2019s threat and power.",
      "How Spielberg orchestrates the scene, from the atmospheric, tension building of the rainstorm, through the initial reveal and reactions, the prolonged attack and subsequent escape, takes the audience through a range of emotions. Although the CGI sections are relatively short, they have a huge impact on the overall storytelling, not to mention the believability that the event is actually happening in front of us. It\u2019s a true representation of the power of cinema.",
      "On release, Jurassic Park became an instant box office success, becoming the highest-grossing film ever at that time.",
      "It also presented the perfect opportunity to develop and showcase the latest advances in CGI. The thrill of seeing the stampede of Gallimimus, the horror of the T. rex attack and the suspense of the Velociraptor hunt captivated audiences across the globe.",
      "Jurassic Park inspired a number of similarly themed movies, such as Disney\u2019s Dinosaur (2000) and the award-winning BBC television series Walking with Dinosaurs (1999). But more than that, it helped bring about a revolution in the use of CGI in film-making.",
      "From those six minutes of animated dinosaurs, CGI has become so integrated into the industry to the extent that nearly all film and television productions feature some form of CGI practice. This can simply mean digitally cleaning up aspects of the filmed image with removals and replacements, set extensions, adding CGI set models or animated vehicles and props, to filming with green screen and compositing images, or merging actors within full CGI environments.",

Other feature films such as Journey To The Centre Of The Earth (1959), The Lost World (1960) and The Land That Time Forgot (1974) had attempted alternative ways of bringing dinosaurs to the screen, including puppetry and even fitting live reptiles with prosthetics.",
      "Of these methods, a combination of stop-motion animation for long shots and animatronic puppets for close-ups was initially chosen by Spielberg for Jurassic Park.",
      "Stop-motion tests produced good results, especially in the development of go-motion, a technique which blurred models to provide a sense of movement similar to that of live action.",
      "But Spielberg and his team were still keen to go further with what was possible. Dennis Muren from visual effects company Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) provided an alternative approach by using CGI modelling and animation.",
      "Off the back of pioneering CGI work in The Abyss (1989) and Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991), Muren and his team produced a test sequence of skeletal dinosaurs. Additional tests featuring a Tyrannosaurus rex with added skin further cemented the realisation that this was the way to go for the film. This technique built the model of the dinosaur from bones, added muscle and then, finally, the skin.",
      "It seemed the assembled stop-motion team had been made extinct by this innovative technology. However, the model-makers and animators were the experts on dinosaurs and their movement, and they retrained as computer animators to continue to use their skills on the production.",
      "Jurassic Park features 15 minutes of on-screen dinosaurs, of which approximately nine minutes feature Stan Winston\u2019s animatronics and six minutes feature ILM\u2019s CGI animation. The success of this combination is seen in the iconic T. rex attack scene. A number of animatronic shots feature close-ups of the T. rex before the full-height shots provide the creature\u2019s threat and power.",
      "How Spielberg orchestrates the scene, from the atmospheric, tension building of the rainstorm, through the initial reveal and reactions, the prolonged attack and subsequent escape, takes the audience through a range of emotions. Although the CGI sections are relatively short, they have a huge impact on the overall storytelling, not to mention the believability that the event is actually happening in front of us. It\u2019s a true representation of the power of cinema.",
      "On release, Jurassic Park became an instant box office success, becoming the highest-grossing film ever at that time.",
      "It also presented the perfect opportunity to develop and showcase the latest advances in CGI. The thrill of seeing the stampede of Gallimimus, the horror of the T. rex attack and the suspense of the Velociraptor hunt captivated audiences across the globe.",
      "Jurassic Park inspired a number of similarly themed movies, such as Disney\u2019s Dinosaur (2000) and the award-winning BBC television series Walking with Dinosaurs (1999). But more than that, it helped bring about a revolution in the use of CGI in film-making.",
      "From those six minutes of animated dinosaurs, CGI has become so integrated into the industry to the extent that nearly all film and television productions feature some form of CGI practice. This can simply mean digitally cleaning up aspects of the filmed image with removals and replacements, set extensions, adding CGI set models or animated vehicles and props, to filming with green screen and compositing images, or merging actors within full CGI environments.",

      "June 2023 marks the 30th anniversary of a film that changed cinema forever. 1993\u2019s Jurassic Park used pioneering computer-generated imagery (CGI) to bring dinosaurs to life in director Steven Spielberg\u2019s adaptation of the novel of the same name.",
      "The film quickly became a must-see event, and audiences were left amazed by the spectacle of seeing believable dinosaurs grace the big screen for the first time. Jurassic Park not only made giant leaps in special-effects film-making, but it also paved the way for myriad subsequent productions that featured beasts of all shapes and sizes.",
      "Jurassic Park originated in 1983 as a screenplay by author Michael Crichton, whose previous foray into film as writer and director of Westworld (1973) featured an immersive amusement park where androids malfunctioned and caused havoc. But his dinosaur-themed story first found publication as the novel Jurassic Park, which was released in 1990 and became a bestseller.",
      "That\u2019s when it came to the attention of Spielberg. By the early 1990s, Spielberg was no stranger to big-budget science-fiction film-making. The likes of Jaws (1975), Close Encounters Of The Third Kind (1977), Raiders Of The Lost Ark (1981) and E. T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982) had demonstrated that he had a track record of making extremely successful effects-heavy but story-led films. That made Jurassic Park perfect for his next production.",

City\u2019s owner, watching his team in a competitive match for the first time since 2010, is the Emirati royal Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan. His Qatari neighbours hosted this winter\u2019s World Cup. Saudi clubs have spent the past few months signing some of the world\u2019s best players, including Cristiano Ronaldo. Meanwhile, in the week of City\u2019s triumph, Saudi Arabia effectively took control of golf\u2019s PGA tour.",
      "No region outside Western Europe has ever had such a grip on football\u2019s shiniest baubles. Many fans lament this \u2013 partly because of the Gulf monarchies\u2019 mistreatment of women, migrants, LGBT people and dissidents, and partly from a feeling that football shouldn\u2019t be for sale. There are still attempts to contest the Gulf\u2019s dominance. The Premier League has referred City to an independent commission, which will review more than 100 allegations of financial rule-breaking \u2013 charges that the club denies. But football faces a dilemma. Gulf money has made the contest at the top of the European game much more exciting than it would have been otherwise.",
      "Look at how Emirati funds lifted Manchester City from joke status into football\u2019s trendsetting team. Every City fan in Istanbul over the age of 30 could remember the years of stumbles. In 1998-1999, the team spent an embarrassing season in English football\u2019s third tier. City\u2019s fans often treated their club almost as the footballing branch of Monty Python. They waved inflatable plastic bananas and sang, surreally, \u201cWe\u2019re not really here.\u201d",
      "That old City survives only in the form of songs, dances and memories. On the field, the Emiratis transformed the club. Their money bought players who won trophies, in the process wiping out the old football cliche that held: \u201cYou can\u2019t buy a winning team.\u201d",
      "In fact, if you want a winning team, you have to buy it, with salaries and usually with transfer fees, too. The ugly truth of football economics is that the only way for Cinderella to become a princess is to be bought by a prince.",
      "City are following in the oil-fuelled slipstream of Chelsea, who were bought by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich in 2003. The two clubs between them won 12 of the last 19 English titles. They are also the only European clubs since 1999 to win a Champions League for the first time. Oil money has allowed two upstarts to beat the established powers.",
      "English football could have taken a different route, rejecting Gulf money. It could have followed Germany, with its \u201c50 + 1 rule\u201d, which states that club members must hold a majority of voting rights. That stops outsiders from taking over clubs. The rule is often praised by football traditionalists. However, it means that German football has no oil-fuelled upstarts. The consequence is that the German club with historically the highest revenues, Bayern Munich, faces no serious challengers, and has won 11 league titles in a row. The rule also means that no other club from Europe\u2019s biggest economy has a hope of winning the Champions League, whereas three different English clubs have won in just the last five seasons. Now yet another oil-fuelled challenger may be emerging: Saudi-owned Newcastle United, freshly qualified for the Champions League.",
      "Gulf money will probably keep shaping football for a while yet. Qatari Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani is bidding to buy Manchester United from the Glazer family, and Saudi Arabia may bid to host the 2030 World Cup, perhaps jointly with Greece and Egypt.",
      "The monarchies\u2019 spending on football is often explained as a cunning plan to \u201csportswash\u201d their reputations, or as an \u201cinvestment\u201d to diversify their economies away from oil and gas \u2013 even though football clubs typically lose money, especially given the salaries that the Gulf royals pay.",
      "In fact, there is a simpler explanation for why these people went into football: It\u2019s fun. It makes their friends and neighbours jealous. It\u2019s an affordable hobby for billionaires. And they face almost no competition from their peers elsewhere. Mr Abramovich and other Russian oligarchs have been expelled from the sport since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, few Chinese ever entered, while most Americans who buy into football want to make profits from their clubs, and therefore baulk at paying the salaries that would allow their teams to compete with the likes of City.",
      "So European football has become a status competition between Gulf monarchies, with City showing the potential to build a dynasty. The men\u2019s team coach, Pep Guardiola, in situ since 2016, has constructed one of the great teams in football history, even if they didn\u2019t show it in Istanbul. This season they have won the treble of Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup. They attack, they are tactically innovative, and the current squad is young enough to remain dominant. Early on Sunday morning, exhausted in triumph, Guardiola warned Real Madrid, who have won 14 Champions Leagues to City\u2019s one: \u201cWe are on our way.

His Qatari neighbours hosted this winter\u2019s World Cup. Saudi clubs have spent the past few months signing some of the world\u2019s best players, including Cristiano Ronaldo. Meanwhile, in the week of City\u2019s triumph, Saudi Arabia effectively took control of golf\u2019s PGA tour.",
      "No region outside Western Europe has ever had such a grip on football\u2019s shiniest baubles. Many fans lament this \u2013 partly because of the Gulf monarchies\u2019 mistreatment of women, migrants, LGBT people and dissidents, and partly from a feeling that football shouldn\u2019t be for sale. There are still attempts to contest the Gulf\u2019s dominance. The Premier League has referred City to an independent commission, which will review more than 100 allegations of financial rule-breaking \u2013 charges that the club denies. But football faces a dilemma. Gulf money has made the contest at the top of the European game much more exciting than it would have been otherwise.",
      "Look at how Emirati funds lifted Manchester City from joke status into football\u2019s trendsetting team. Every City fan in Istanbul over the age of 30 could remember the years of stumbles. In 1998-1999, the team spent an embarrassing season in English football\u2019s third tier. City\u2019s fans often treated their club almost as the footballing branch of Monty Python. They waved inflatable plastic bananas and sang, surreally, \u201cWe\u2019re not really here.\u201d",
      "That old City survives only in the form of songs, dances and memories. On the field, the Emiratis transformed the club. Their money bought players who won trophies, in the process wiping out the old football cliche that held: \u201cYou can\u2019t buy a winning team.\u201d",
      "In fact, if you want a winning team, you have to buy it, with salaries and usually with transfer fees, too. The ugly truth of football economics is that the only way for Cinderella to become a princess is to be bought by a prince.",
      "City are following in the oil-fuelled slipstream of Chelsea, who were bought by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich in 2003. The two clubs between them won 12 of the last 19 English titles. They are also the only European clubs since 1999 to win a Champions League for the first time. Oil money has allowed two upstarts to beat the established powers.",
      "English football could have taken a different route, rejecting Gulf money. It could have followed Germany, with its \u201c50 + 1 rule\u201d, which states that club members must hold a majority of voting rights. That stops outsiders from taking over clubs. The rule is often praised by football traditionalists. However, it means that German football has no oil-fuelled upstarts. The consequence is that the German club with historically the highest revenues, Bayern Munich, faces no serious challengers, and has won 11 league titles in a row. The rule also means that no other club from Europe\u2019s biggest economy has a hope of winning the Champions League, whereas three different English clubs have won in just the last five seasons. Now yet another oil-fuelled challenger may be emerging: Saudi-owned Newcastle United, freshly qualified for the Champions League.",
      "Gulf money will probably keep shaping football for a while yet. Qatari Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani is bidding to buy Manchester United from the Glazer family, and Saudi Arabia may bid to host the 2030 World Cup, perhaps jointly with Greece and Egypt.",
      "The monarchies\u2019 spending on football is often explained as a cunning plan to \u201csportswash\u201d their reputations, or as an \u201cinvestment\u201d to diversify their economies away from oil and gas \u2013 even though football clubs typically lose money, especially given the salaries that the Gulf royals pay.",
      "In fact, there is a simpler explanation for why these people went into football: It\u2019s fun. It makes their friends and neighbours jealous. It\u2019s an affordable hobby for billionaires. And they face almost no competition from their peers elsewhere. Mr Abramovich and other Russian oligarchs have been expelled from the sport since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, few Chinese ever entered, while most Americans who buy into football want to make profits from their clubs, and therefore baulk at paying the salaries that would allow their teams to compete with the likes of City.",
      "So European football has become a status competition between Gulf monarchies, with City showing the potential to build a dynasty. The men\u2019s team coach, Pep Guardiola, in situ since 2016, has constructed one of the great teams in football history, even if they didn\u2019t show it in Istanbul. This season they have won the treble of Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup. They attack, they are tactically innovative, and the current squad is young enough to remain dominant. Early on Sunday morning, exhausted in triumph, Guardiola warned Real Madrid, who have won 14 Champions Leagues to City\u2019s one: \u201cWe are on our way.

By one estimate, if human babies grew at the same pace as today\u2019s broiler chickens, at two months, they would weigh 660 pounds \u2013 so it\u2019s no surprise that chickens\u2019 legs often give out and that by some accounts, they suffer chronic pain.",

      "We haven\u2019t figured out our moral obligations to fellow humans, so perhaps it\u2019s understandable that we haven\u2019t worked out our obligations to shellfish. But the way people struggle with these questions strikes me as a measure of moral progress \u2013 and of the power of ideas.",

Mr Boris Johnson may have once been commissioned to write a study of Shakespeare, but he has never taken that particular line to heart. Perhaps that\u2019s why he returned the publisher\u2019s advance.",
      "Late on Friday, Mr Johnson resigned abruptly as an MP rather than fight a by-election after an investigation found that he had misled Parliament over the Downing Street parties scandal. In a vituperative 1,000-word statement, he condemned his accusers and then launched a frontal assault on Prime Minister Rishi Sunak for betraying Brexit and leading the Conservative party to electoral disaster. He is unlikely to go gentle into that good night.",
      "When a senior minister, Mr Michael Gove, suggested that Mr Johnson resign as prime minister after his authority crumbled in 2022, he fired the man on the spot. Three-time election winners like Mrs Margaret Thatcher and Mr Tony Blair may have allowed themselves to be pushed into the departure lounge of politics by colleagues, but Boris was never going to go peaceably. Nor has he quite gone.",
      "Polling expert Matthew Goodwin, who has charted the rise of British populism sympathetically, notes this weekend that Mr Johnson has already brought down three prime ministers. First was Mr David Cameron, over Brexit. Next came his successor, Mrs Theresa May, over the terms of the exit deal. Finally, he scuppered his own leadership by breaking lockdown rules during the pandemic and failing to be frank about it. Now he has a fourth prime minister in his sights \u2013 Mr Sunak.",
      "Mr Johnson may be sincere in some of what he wrote in his resignation statement \u2013 the self-pity is certainly authentic and has always been his Achilles heel (as I know from my days as a newspaper editor, fending off injured replies when he felt he had been traduced \u2013 or simply not loved enough). It does, however, veer towards a skewed representation of the truth \u2013 he knows that Mr Sunak\u2019s credentials as a Brexiteer have never been in doubt. The two just differ on what can practically be delivered to enforce the separation from the European Union.",
      "In the statement, Mr Johnson accuses the cross-party House of Commons Privileges Committee of seven MPs of being \u201cdetermined to use the proceedings against me to drive me out of Parliament\u201d, which he says sets an \u201cunsettling\u201d and undemocratic precedent. Its Labour chair, Ms Harriet Harman, is indeed a sworn enemy \u2013 but her committee has a Conservative majority.",
      "Mr Johnson is addicted to risk-taking and the limelight. He could, of course, butt out of politics altogether and add to his mountainous cash pile acquired from public-speaking engagements \u2013 he has earned more than \u00a36.5 million (S$11 million) in the last year alone. But although he loves the money, he might soon get bored.",
      "It\u2019s nice being feted abroad, especially in the US, and in Ukraine he gets a hero\u2019s welcome for his full-throated defence of that nation. But he may miss the applause back home. Domestic journalists are obsessed with him, with the media lapping up his every word. Like Oscar Wilde, he is a self-publicist who believes there\u2019s nothing worse than being talked about, other than not being talked about.",
      "So, the great gambler of modern British politics may be embarking upon his biggest crapshoot so far, and the stakes are high \u2013 and not only for him. For there is usually method in what his liberal and left-wing critics take to be political madness.",
      "The clue lies in the Trumpian vocabulary of his resignation statement \u2013 \u201cwitch-hunts\u201d, \u201ckangaroo court\u201d, \u201cbetrayal\u201d. Like his recent host, the former president of the United States, Mr Johnson has rejected the process that brought him low.",
      "On the right of British politics, strong winds are still blowing towards populism. Although Mr Johnson\u2019s popularity in the country at large has plummeted since his huge electoral win in 2019, many Conservative voters and party members still regard him as their once and future king. Mr Sunak comes mid-level in the popularity polls of the ConservativeHome website.",
      "The ruling party is at a crossroads. Mr Sunak was not the first choice of party members (Mr Johnson chooses to regard him as a scheming back-stabber following Mr Sunak\u2019s resignation as his Chancellor of the Exchequer). The tax-cutting revolution of Ms Liz Truss, Mr Johnson\u2019s anointed successor, may have crashed and burned on contact with reality last autumn, but that agenda still gets Tory pulses racing. Panicky Conservative MPs have recently been clamouring for the abolition of inheritance tax. They want income tax cuts, too; in fact, anything to bribe the voters with their own money before the next election.",
      "Politics, like comedy, is about the way you tell them. Mr Sunak\u2019s credentials as a right-winger on immigration, Brexit and free-market economics are the real thing. But activists see income and business taxes rising to unprecedented post-war levels. Then they look at their leader, a soft-spoken former Goldman Sachs banker in a sharp suit and Prada loafers, and despair of him retaining the Brexit-supporting voters of \u201cleft-behind Britain\u201d acquired at the last election.",
      "The party faithful\u2019s heads tell them they can\u2019t have Trussonomics, but their hearts are with Mr Johnson\u2019s philosophy of \u201ccakeism\u201d \u2013 having it and eating it, with both high spending and low taxes.",
      "Why should Boris volunteer for the ignominy of by-election defeat in his Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency, with its vulnerable majority, when he can live to fight another day, say his allies? Perhaps another departing Tory MP will help gift him a safe seat, if his candidacy is not blocked by Conservative headquarters.",
      "In any case, if Mr Sunak goes crashing down to defeat in the next 18 months, Tory associations, by Mr Johnson\u2019s reckoning, will demand his return.",
      "Mr Sunak is already walking, in the words of his top strategist Isaac Levido, \u201ca narrow path to victory\u201d. The Labour opposition has a large lead in the polls and its leader, Mr Keir Starmer, has wiped out left-wing dissent in his ranks. Although the present prime minister no longer fears a threat from Mr Johnson\u2019s dwindling band of backbench supporters, the Boris circus is a distraction he can do without. It makes him look weak, and the party divided.",

      "Potential rivals might also hope to leverage the argument for having a contest this round. Out of five presidential elections since 1993, only two were contested (in 1993 and 2011). The act of casting a ballot is significant for democratic choice and for candidates to gain a fair hearing.",
      "As a Nominated Member of Parliament between 2012 and 2014, I had the opportunity to observe close-up Mr Tharman in action in Parliament. In fielding parliamentary questions, he was scrupulously respectful of parliamentarians from across the aisle.",
      "He always endeavoured to answer queries without seeking partisan advantage. During debates on his Budget statements, he was also very persuasive with his erudite arguments and patient explanations in the face of MPs\u2019 calls for the Government to do more, to spend more, and to tax less.",

Trust in the PAP to run the government and do what is best for Singaporeans is intact. Second, the swing in votes (though from an unrepeatable high in 2015) is leading the party to review its own game so as to win the hearts, and not just the minds, of a changing electorate.",

These needs are threatened when we are ignored, or shunned, or made to feel invisible. The worst would be to feel erased, as though we had no right to exist.

The next stage is coping, when people adapt behaviours to try to fit in, such as trying to please the group.

      "I couldn\u2019t go into the office last Tuesday. The finale of what I consider to be the greatest TV show of the last decade, Succession, had aired the previous day, and I hadn\u2019t yet watched it. The risk of hearing spoilers from my colleagues was unacceptably high.",
      "So I embarked on a comprehensive spoiler-shielding programme: I stayed at home, muted a particularly telly-focused WhatsApp group, and avoided social media. Or I tried to, anyway.",
      "In the end, it was my addiction to the latter that proved my downfall: in a moment of distraction, my thumb found its way to the Twitter app, and there it was, right in front of me: a tweet containing a giant spoiler.",
      "Some might argue that I should have just watched the 90-minute episode when it aired \u2013 which was 2am in London \u2013 or at least as soon after that as possible (I would counter that I had other, more important things to do). They might also lament my inability to avoid social media, where TV series are often discussed (I have since installed a Twitter-blocking app, which is remarkably effective).",
      "But what is the correct etiquette when it comes to sharing spoilers? Surely we don\u2019t have to watch every show we love as soon as it comes out. And what of the \u201cspoilees\u201d: those who actively share plot details because they feel part of a cultural moment and want to signal that they are au courant?",
      "I ran a (somewhat unscientific) Twitter poll this week to get other people\u2019s thoughts. The results were quite clear: of 478 votes, the biggest group \u2013 just over 33 per cent \u2013 felt spoilers shouldn\u2019t be shared until at least a week after a show has aired, if ever. Almost as many said a few days to a week was the right amount of time. Only 22 per cent thought it was acceptable to share spoilers immediately, as the LA Times did earlier in the series, publishing a faux-obituary for a certain key character minutes after Succession had aired.",
      "It\u2019s not just TV shows that can be spoiled. Unless an author has himself written a spoiler into a story (like Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cstar-cross\u2019d lovers\u201d, whose fate we are told in the prologue of Romeo and Juliet), I don\u2019t want any clues as to what might happen in plays or novels, either. And there is sometimes fun to be had by not revealing an ending, as audiences of Agatha Christie\u2019s The Mousetrap, the longest-running play in history, have largely managed since 1952.",
      "But is our spoilerphobia warranted? Perhaps not. A study published in 2011 by two psychologists at the University of California, San Diego, found that spoilers not only do not ruin the enjoyment of stories; they actually increase it. Participants were given three short stories each to read, from three different genres \u2013 mystery, literary and \u201cironic-twist\u201d. One of these stories had a \u201cspoiler\u201d paragraph at the start, in which the plot was discussed, and the ending revealed in a way that seemed inadvertent. In all three categories, readers enjoyed these \u201cspoiled\u201d versions more.",
      "\u201cWhat people liked was a better understanding of the story,\u201d Mr Jon Leavitt, one of the study\u2019s authors, tells me. And knowing the ending does not necessarily ruin the suspense: \u201cPeople underestimate the extent to which you inhabit a story while you\u2019re engaged with it\u2026\u2009The situation is still unfolding in front of you.\u201d",
      "I can relate to this. In films I\u2019ve seen multiple times, I still root for the guy to get the girl; I still hope the catastrophe I know is coming can be averted. There are also times when having a better understanding can improve the experience \u2013 I always read the synopsis before going to see an opera.",
      "But there is a difference between choosing to find out what happens and suddenly learning something you were not meant to. The former is not really a \u201cspoiler\u201d at all, but the latter is, and there is a sense of disappointment in an accidental discovery \u2013 both in fiction and in life.",
      "Other research has provided a more nuanced picture. A 2016 study found that those of us who have what psychologists call a \u201cneed for cognition\u201d \u2013 that is, who are inclined to undergo effortful cognitive activity \u2013 are more likely to want to be kept in suspense. So are those of us who have a \u201cneed for affect\u201d, meaning a desire to experience many different emotional states. I think I have a need for both.",
      "Spoilers do, to some extent, \u201cspoil\u201d our enjoyment of the escapist entertainment a show like Succession provides. I propose, for future \u201cappointment TV\u201d, a 24-hour embargo for the discussion of crucial plot developments to allow all time zones to catch up. After that, it is open season.",
      "We shouldn\u2019t kill the thrill of suspense, but neither should we deprive people of the rare opportunity to come together for a happy and frivolous reason, all at once, in the overwhelming, endless, and often misery-inducing expanse that is the Internet. FINANCIAL TIMES"

      "The return of 120ha of land, occupied by the Singapore Turf Club (STC) since 1999, to the Government by March 2027 marks the end of more than 180 years of horse racing in Singapore. Local racing operations at Kranji will cease in 2024, with the last event scheduled for Oct 5, coinciding with the 100th Grand Singapore Gold Cup. Racing enthusiasts naturally bemoan the passing of an era in which the club, founded under a different name in 1842, saw the inaugural Singapore Cup race being held in 1843 and the first run of the Singapore Derby in 1880. The Bukit Timah Racecourse, built in 1933, would come to be regarded as the finest in the East. Local turf history was made in 1981 when two Australians became the first women granted permits to ride. In between and after such milestones, the club has served as a place not only for punters to come together to witness the drama of money to be made (or lost) from the competitive display of equestrian skills, but also as a companionable arena in which to socialise with the fellow-minded.",
      "Sadly, horse racing has witnessed dwindling spectatorship over the years. Now, the last race is about to be run. Yet, the greater reason for the STC\u2019s closure lies in the compulsions of land-use planning in Singapore. The Government is obliged to review its land-use plans continually to meet today\u2019s needs, while ensuring that there is sufficient land for future generations. The redevelopment of the Singapore Racecourse site would allow for the land and its surroundings to be transformed to meet future land-use needs better. Building housing at the site would support the development of Woodlands Regional Centre as Singapore\u2019s largest northern economic hub. Other major plans include redeveloping the Woodlands Checkpoint, enhancing Woodlands Town, and turning Lim Chu Kang into a high-tech agri-food cluster. Yet other potential uses include leisure and recreation.",
      "Also, given that the closure of the club would not have a significant impact on government finances, the authorities need to optimise the value of the racecourse as a national resource in the interests of all Singaporeans, not just the equestrian and punting communities. Public policy decisions are never easy, particularly when they involve weighing legitimate social sentiments against pressing economic imperatives. Golf, another land-intensive sport, has seen several clubs come under the unsentimental gaze of land-use planning. There is no denying the nostalgia associated with historical places of sports. It attests to the necessary importance that Singaporeans place on known ways of life. However, a land-scarce island city-state needs to remain economically sustainable.

The distinction between Europe and Asia became real in terms of military conquests and extraordinary gaps in wealth.",

There is no doubt that over the past decades, Asian societies, notably those of east Asia, have been hugely successful in this regard.",

      "The big story then is of the recovery of what we call Asia, led by east Asia, from its steep relative economic decline in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In the process, Eurasia has substantially rebalanced and so, quite naturally, has the world as a whole. This \u201cgreat convergence\u201d is also not due to some uniquely \u201cAsian\u201d culture. The very different cultures of Asia, and especially of east and south Asia, have embraced what one might consider European notions: competitive markets, free enterprise, liberal trade, education and the goal of economic growth.",
      "Precise packages vary. They depend on the histories and political cultures of specific societies. China and India, for example, are extraordinarily different from each other. But many of these societies do share a desire for more prosperous lives. Yet this is not by any means uniquely Asian. It is universal. What is a little less so, alas, is the ability to organise societies in ways that make the achievement possible. There is no doubt that over the past decades, Asian societies, notably those of east Asia, have been hugely successful in this regard.",
      "It is not at all surprising that this catch-up by such a vast number of people generates huge opportunities for commerce among them, as the McKinsey Global Institute has noted. The creation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership around China (but without India) suggests this may develop faster, though it also underlines the almost inevitable centrality of China in any such process of integration.",
      "What then can we say about this rebalancing of Eurasia and so the world? The most important point is that it is natural. The extraordinary power enjoyed by Europeans and the United States, their potent progeny, is dwindling. Not surprisingly, what we call Asia, close to half of the human population and home to some of the world\u2019s historic civilisations, is leading the change. Barring catastrophes, this is also likely to continue. The world economy\u2019s centre of gravity is simply shifting east. Asia then will be hugely economically and politically important. But it will also have highly significant internal rivalries and difficulties of its own. There will be no collective Asian \u201cwill\u201d, other than for societies to pursue their own paths.",
      "Meanwhile, the West needs to get two contrasting thoughts into its collective head. First, it must deal with the world as it is. Second, it must defend the best of its values, notably democracy and individual freedom, regardless of what anybody else in the world thinks. Who, after all, supposed life would get easier?

    "point_form_context": [
      "1. The future is Asian, but the concept of \"Asia\" as a single continent is an invention of Europeans.",

      "3. Eurasia, the continent of long-lasting human civilizations, is the home of Confucian, Hindu, Islamic, and Christendom civilizations.",

      "I will confess that when Apple introduced its mixed-reality Vision Pro headsets on Monday, one of my first thoughts was: Man, that thing looks weird.",
      "I was not alone. On social media, the reaction to the Vision Pro was less than kind. Sceptics mocked the device\u2019s snowboard-goggle-like appearance, its steep price tag \u2013 US$3,500 (S$4,719) and Apple\u2019s lofty pitch about the \u201cspatial computing\u201d era its arrival heralded. There were comparisons to the robot WALL-E, and Twitter memes about people watching pornography in virtual reality (VR).",
      "I get it. I have been a virtual reality sceptic for years, and I have long wondered why the technology has not gone mainstream, even as headset quality has improved. I was always dubious about Mr Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s pitch for the metaverse, which had \u201cpersonal conquest\u201d vibes more so than \u201cactual market demand\u201d vibes. And if you had asked me before Monday\u2019s announcement whether I thought Apple\u2019s mixed-reality headset signified the beginning of a huge, earthshaking platform shift, on the order of the original iPhone\u2019s arrival, I would have said no.",
      "But after seeing Apple demonstrate the Vision Pro on Monday \u2013 and reading the generally positive reviews from folks who have tested it \u2013 I now think it could be a big deal, and possibly even the first hint of a revolutionary new computing platform.",
      "There are plenty of reasons the Vision Pro could flop. It could be too expensive, too ugly, too isolating. Persuading developers to build good, useful smartphone apps is easier than persuading them to build apps for a device you have to strap to your head, for an audience that has never really materialised at a meaningful scale. And Apple could discover what Meta has found so far with its forays into productivity-based VR apps \u2013 that there just are not a lot of people in the world who are interested in reading their e-mails in VR.",
      "But I cannot dismiss the possibility that despite its limitations \u2013 such as the need to tote around a connected battery pack \u2013 the Vision Pro can be a hit.",
      "Is it expensive? Yes. But so are lots of first-generation gadgets, and the \u201cPro\u201d in the name suggests that a less expensive, more consumer-oriented model may be on the way.",
      "Is it fun and impressive to use? Early testers seem to think so, although they have not had much time with it, and they are a fairly excitable group. The real test will come when the devices are shipped to users (in early 2024, according to Apple) and people start working them into their daily routines.",
      "Part of my open-mindedness to the Vision Pro, I admit, is due to a kind of tech columnist PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). In 2013, before the first Apple Watch was released, I wrote a column confidently declaring that smartwatches were a dumb idea. I mocked their looks, dismissed them as expensive toys and boldly proclaimed that Apple would be crazy to invest heavily in a product category that I could not imagine resonating beyond young, moneyed Silicon Valley nerds. (Apple is now the No. 1 watch brand in the world, and it sells an estimated 40 million watches every year. I wear one, as do many of my friends and relatives.)",
      "Obviously, my Apple Watch prediction was extremely, comically wrong, for a few reasons.",
      "First, I underestimated Apple\u2019s ability to expand a market, turning a niche product category into a mainstream one. In 2013, there were other smartwatches on the market, and none of them had been huge hits, so I concluded that the Apple Watch would not be a huge hit, either. I looked at the bulky, ugly aesthetics of existing smartwatches and concluded that the kinds of people who were willing to wear them on their wrists every day \u2013 nerds like me \u2013 were not a big enough market to matter.",
      "But I neglected to remember that Apple is Apple, and that it has repeatedly demonstrated that it can, through sheer force of will, turn a niche product for nerds into a thing that everyone wants.",
      "That is a testament to the company\u2019s famous product and marketing prowess. And it is part of why I am reluctant to dismiss the Vision Pro\u2019s chances.",
      "Sure, there are good virtual and mixed-reality headsets out there, and even some decent apps for them. But those headsets are not made by Apple, and they have not been seamlessly integrated into the entire Apple ecosystem the way that Vision Pro will be. Having all of your iPhone contacts, iMessages and iOS settings integrated into a mixed-reality headset from the moment you turn it on could mean the difference between a device you actually use every day, and a novelty toy you shove into a closet after a few weeks.",
      "Another error I made with the Apple Watch back in 2013 was that I forgot that human behaviour is not fixed, and that our ideas of what is considered fashionable and socially acceptable change all the time in response to new technologies.",
      "Back then, part of what I was reacting to was a social norm. At the time, it might have been considered rude to glance at your watch during a meeting, or while having dinner with your family. But a decade later, that action no longer registers (to me, at least) as inappropriate, because so many people now have Apple Watches that many people have developed new norms around it.",
      "Now, we assume that people who check their watches at dinner are probably trying to avoid pulling out their phones, which would be ruder and more disruptive. In other words, mass adoption killed the taboo.",
      "The same thing could happen with mixed-reality headsets. Sure, you might feel self-conscious putting on a Vision Pro today. But a few years from now, if a third of your co-workers are joining Zoom calls with their headsets, and you see people watching VR movies on every flight you take, it might not feel so dumb.",
