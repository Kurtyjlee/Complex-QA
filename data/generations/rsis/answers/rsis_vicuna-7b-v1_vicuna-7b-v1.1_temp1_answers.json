    "question": "1. What is the underlying cause of the phenomenon of protectionism emerging globally?",
    "output": [
      "The underlying cause of the phenomenon of protectionism emerging globally is the fear of economic loss and job insecurity. In a globalized economy, countries are increasingly interconnected, and this has led to increased competition for markets and resources. As a result, countries may resort to protectionist policies to protect their domestic industries and jobs from foreign competition. This can lead to trade barriers, such as tariffs and quotas, which make it more difficult for foreign companies to access domestic markets. This can lead to a decrease in trade and an increase in economic isolationism. Additionally, political and economic instability in some countries can also lead to protectionism as countries may feel threatened by the potential loss of resources and jobs."

      "Firstly, the increase in domestic oil production has led to a decrease in the US's reliance on foreign oil imports, resulting in a reduction of the country's trade deficit. This reduction in imports has also led to an increase in the US's trade surplus, as the country is now exporting more oil than it is importing.",
      "",
      "Secondly, the decrease in oil imports has also led to a decrease in the US's dependence on foreign oil, which has in turn reduced the country's reliance on foreign currency. This has led to a decrease in the US's demand for foreign currency, which has resulted in a decrease in the country's trade deficit.",
      "",
      "Finally, the increase in US oil production has also led to an increase in the country's treasury issuance, as the government has been able to collect more revenue from the sale of oil.

Firstly, quantitative easing allowed central banks to increase the money supply and lower interest rates, which in turn stimulated economic growth.

However, some argue that quantitative easing only benefited the wealthy and did not lead to sustainable economic growth.",

      "",
      "Finally, ASEAN's history of human rights violations and its lack of accountability mechanisms have undermined its credibility in addressing the Myanmar crisis. The organization has been criticized for its failure to address human rights abuses in the past, including in Cambodia, Laos, and Timor-Leste. This has eroded trust in ASEAN's ability to address the crisis in Myanmar and has called into question its commitment to upholding human rights.",

      "In conclusion, ASEAN's political diversity, history of non-interference, and history of human rights violations have significant impacts on its ability to address the Myanmar crisis. The organization's inability to reach a consensus, its limited ability to take a strong stance against the military's actions, and its lack of accountability mechanisms have all contributed to its ineffectiveness in addressing the crisis."

      "The unified rules of origin (ROO) system of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) differs from those of other free trade agreements in several ways. Firstly, RCEP aims to simplify the ROO system by reducing the number of certificates required for tariff concessions, which will reduce the transaction costs for businesses. Secondly, RCEP aims to establish a single set of ROO for goods, which will make it easier for businesses to take advantage of tariff concessions. This will also help to streamline regional supply chains and manufacturers. Finally, RCEP aims to establish a single set of ROO for services, which will make it easier for service providers to take advantage of tariff concessions.

Firstly, the GEA was based on the assumption that the global economy was relatively stable and that the major economies would continue to grow and prosper. However, this assumption was challenged by the oil shocks of the 1970s, which led to a decline in the value of the US dollar and a rise in inflation. This led to the collapse of the Bretton Woods system and the end of the gold standard.",

Firstly, deterrence is about preventing an adversary from taking a certain action by threatening them with retaliation if they do so.

This can be achieved through a range of means, such as demonstrating a willingness to use force, maintaining a strong military presence, or making clear statements about the consequences of aggression. In contrast, defeating an enemy in war requires the military organization to have the capability to carry out the threat, as well as the ability to adapt to changing circumstances and overcome any challenges that arise.",
      "",
      "Finally, deterrence is often used as a way to prevent conflict from occurring in the first place, while defeating an enemy in war is about achieving a military victory and achieving the objectives of the military organization.

This differs from other instances of recorded acts of terrorism in that the terrorist was able to reach a much wider audience than would have been possible through traditional media outlets. The live-streaming of the event allowed the terrorist to spread their message of hate and violence to a global audience, making it more difficult to contain and prevent future acts of terrorism. Additionally, the live-streaming of the event has raised concerns about the role of social media companies in monitoring and regulating the content that is posted on their platforms. The ease with which the terrorist was able to live-stream the event highlights the need for greater oversight and accountability on the part of social media companies."

    "question": "4. Why did the global trade openness ratio fall sharply during the inter-war period, and what impact did this have on the global economy?",
    "output": [
      "The global trade openness ratio fell sharply during the inter-war period due to a combination of factors, including the onset of the Great Depression, protectionist policies implemented by countries to shield their domestic industries, and the rise of fascist regimes in Europe. This decline in global trade openness had a significant impact on the global economy, leading to a decrease in economic activity, a rise in unemployment, and a decline in international trade.",
      "",
      "Firstly, the onset of the Great Depression in 1929 led to a significant decline in global trade. Many countries implemented protectionist policies in an effort to shield their domestic industries from the effects of the economic downturn. This resulted in a decrease in international trade as countries turned inward and focused on protecting their domestic industries.",
      "",
      "Secondly, protectionist policies implemented by countries during the inter-war period further reduced global trade openness. Countries implemented tariffs and other trade barriers in an effort to protect their domestic industries and prevent the loss of jobs. This led to a decrease in international trade as countries focused on protecting their domestic industries rather than engaging in trade with other countries.",
      "",
      "Finally, the rise of fascist regimes in Europe during the inter-war period also contributed to the decline in global trade openness. These regimes implemented protectionist policies and engaged in economic nationalism, which further reduced global trade openness.",

    "question": "5. What are some of the benefits and costs of the BRI as perceived by stakeholder countries, according to the writer's research?",
    "output": [
      "The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a massive infrastructure project that aims to connect Asia, Europe, and Africa through a network of roads, railways, ports, and other infrastructure. While the BRI has the potential to bring economic benefits to participating countries, it also has costs and risks that need to be considered.",
      "",
      "One of the benefits of the BRI is that it has the potential to create new trade routes and increase economic activity between participating countries. This can lead to increased economic growth and job creation in the countries involved. Additionally, the BRI can help to reduce transportation costs and improve the efficiency of trade.",
      "",
      "However, there are also costs associated with the BRI. One of the main costs is the potential for debt overload. Many of the countries involved in the BRI are already struggling with high levels of debt, and the BRI could lead to further debt accumulation. Additionally, the BRI has been criticized for its lack of transparency and accountability, which has led to concerns about corruption and environmental degradation.",
      "",
      "Another cost of the BRI is the potential for environmental degradation. Many of the infrastructure projects associated with the BRI, such as roads and railways, can have negative impacts on the environment. This can lead to increased pollution and habitat destruction, which can have long-term negative impacts on local ecosystems and communities.",
      "",
      "In conclusion, the BRI has both benefits and costs that need to be considered. While the BRI has the potential to create new trade routes and increase economic activity, it also has the potential to lead to debt overload, corruption, and environmental degradation. It is important for stakeholder countries to carefully weigh the costs and benefits of the BRI before making a decision to participate."

    "question": "1. How can an ASEAN digital currency promote financial inclusion for the underbanked and unbanked population in the region?",
    "output": [
      "1. An ASEAN digital currency can promote financial inclusion for the underbanked and unbanked population in the region by providing a more accessible and convenient way for them to access financial services. This is because digital currencies can be stored and accessed through digital devices, such as smartphones, which are more widely available and affordable in the region than traditional bank accounts. Additionally, digital currencies can be used to make transactions without the need for intermediaries, such as banks, which can reduce transaction costs and increase the speed of transactions. This can make it easier for people in remote or rural areas to participate in the economy and access financial services.",
      "2. An ASEAN digital currency can also promote financial inclusion by increasing competition in the financial sector. By creating a digital currency, the ASEAN region can create a more level playing field for financial institutions, allowing smaller and newer players to enter the market and compete with larger, more established institutions. This can lead to more innovative and affordable financial products and services, which can benefit consumers and promote financial inclusion.",
      "3. Furthermore, an ASEAN digital currency can also promote financial inclusion by increasing the security and stability of the financial system. Digital currencies are less susceptible to fraud and theft than traditional currencies, which can reduce the risk of financial loss for consumers. Additionally, digital currencies can be designed to be more secure and stable than traditional currencies, which can increase confidence in the financial system and encourage more people to participate in it. This can help to promote financial inclusion by increasing the willingness of people to use financial services and products."

    "output": [
      "Game theory plays a significant role in the EU's dependence on Russian gas and its decision-making process. Firstly, the EU's dependence on Russian gas creates a power imbalance between the EU and Russia, as the EU is heavily reliant on Russian energy supplies. This power imbalance can lead to a situation where the EU is less likely to take actions that could potentially harm Russian interests, as it would risk losing its access to Russian gas.",
      "",
      "Secondly, the EU's decision-making process is often influenced by the potential responses of other actors, including Russia. In the context of the EU's dependence on Russian gas, the EU may be more likely to take actions that are perceived as conciliatory towards Russia, in order to avoid actions that could potentially disrupt its energy supplies. This can lead to a situation where the EU's decision-making process is influenced by the potential responses of Russia, rather than its own interests.",
      "",
      "Finally, game theory can also influence the EU's approach to negotiations with Russia over energy supplies. For example, the EU may be more likely to make concessions to Russia in order to secure its energy supplies, as it would risk losing its access to Russian gas. This can lead to a situation where the EU's negotiating position is influenced by the potential responses of Russia, rather than its own interests.",

The EU can increase its use of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, which are becoming increasingly cost-competitive with traditional fossil fuels. This will reduce the EU's reliance on Russian gas and other fossil fuels, which are finite resources.",
      "",
      "Claim 2: Increasing the use of natural gas from other countries is another way to reduce dependence on Russian gas. The EU can increase its imports of natural gas from other countries, such as Norway, the United States, and Qatar, which have large reserves of natural gas. This will reduce the EU's dependence on Russian gas and diversify its energy mix.",
      "",

      "In recent years, there have been reports of the regeneration of pro-IS cells in Indonesia. These cells are primarily composed of Indonesian citizens who have been radicalized and recruited by ISIS to carry out terrorist attacks in the country. The regeneration of these cells can be attributed to several factors, including the government's inability to effectively address the root causes of radicalization, the lack of effective counter-radicalization programs, and the presence of extremist ideologies in Indonesian society.",
      "",
      "One of the primary reasons for the regeneration of pro-IS cells in Indonesia is the government's inability to address the root causes of radicalization. Indonesia is a country with a history of religious and ethnic tensions, and the government's response to these issues has often been inadequate. This has created a vacuum that extremist groups like ISIS have been able to exploit.",
      "",
      "Another factor that has contributed to the regeneration of pro-IS cells in Indonesia is the lack of effective counter-radicalization programs. The government has implemented some programs aimed at countering radicalization, but they have been ineffective due to a lack of resources and a lack of understanding of the root causes of radicalization.",
      "",
      "Finally, the presence of extremist ideologies in Indonesian society has also played a role in the regeneration of pro-IS cells. Indonesia has a large Muslim population, and some extremist groups have been able to exploit this to promote their ideologies. This has created a climate in which radicalization is more likely to occur.",

      "Claim 1: The first radicalization pattern is the use of social media to recruit and mobilize supporters. Pro-IS organizations have been highly effective in using social media platforms such as Twitter and Telegram to reach out to potential recruits and promote their ideology. They use hashtags and other tactics to attract attention and build a following, and they often use videos and other multimedia content to convey their message. This has allowed them to reach a wide audience and to build a sense of community among their supporters.",
      "",
      "Claim 2: The second radicalization pattern is the use of encrypted communication to evade detection and surveillance. Pro-IS organizations have been highly effective in using encrypted communication platforms such as Signal and Telegram to evade detection and surveillance by law enforcement and intelligence agencies. This has allowed them to plan and coordinate attacks, share information, and communicate with each other without being detected. This has made it difficult for law enforcement and intelligence agencies to monitor their activities and to disrupt their operations.",
      "",
      "Claim 3: The third radicalization pattern is the use of propaganda and disinformation to promote their ideology and to undermine trust in institutions. Pro-IS organizations have been highly effective in using propaganda and disinformation to promote their ideology and to undermine trust in institutions such as the government and the media. They use social media and other platforms to spread false information and to promote their ideology, and they often use tactics such as fear-mongering and conspiracy theories to appeal to potential recruits. This has allowed them to build a sense of grievance and to promote their ideology among a wide audience.",
      "",

Putin's early years as president were characterized by a focus on rebuilding Russia's economy and addressing socio-economic challenges such as poverty and unemployment. However, in recent years, Putin's focus has shifted to issues such as corruption and the rule of law, which are seen as more pressing by some. This shift in priorities suggests that Putin is taking a more comprehensive approach to addressing the challenges facing Russia.",

    "output": [
      "The rise of US oil production has had a significant impact on the trade deficit and treasury issuance of both the US and the world.",
      "",
      "Firstly, the increase in domestic oil production has reduced the US's reliance on imported oil, leading to a decrease in the trade deficit. This is because when the US produces more oil domestically, it does not need to import as much oil from other countries, reducing the amount of foreign currency that needs to be spent on imports. This decrease in imports also leads to a decrease in the US's balance of payments deficit, as the US's exports do not need to cover as much of the imports.",
      "",
      "Secondly, the rise of US oil production has also led to an increase in government revenue, as the US is able to tax the production and sale of domestic oil. This increased revenue can be used to reduce treasury issuance, as the government does not need to borrow as much money to fund its operations.",
      "",
      "Lastly, the rise of US oil production has also led to an increase in global oil production, which has put downward pressure on global oil prices. This decrease in oil prices can lead to a decrease in the trade surplus of oil-exporting countries, as their exports become less competitive in the global market.",

      "In conclusion, the rise of US oil production has had a significant impact on the trade deficit and treasury issuance of both the US and the world. It has reduced the US's reliance on imported oil, increased government revenue, and put downward pressure on global oil prices."

    "question": "3. What role did quantitative easing and near zero or below zero interest rates play in the past decade?",
    "output": [
      "The past decade has seen a significant shift in monetary policy, with the use of quantitative easing (QE) and near-zero or below-zero interest rates becoming increasingly prevalent. These policies have had a profound impact on the global economy and have been a source of both debate and controversy.",
      "",
      "One key claim is that QE and low interest rates have contributed to the creation of asset bubbles in certain sectors of the economy. For example, in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, central banks around the world engaged in aggressive QE, which led to a surge in asset prices, such as stocks and real estate. While these policies may have helped to stimulate economic growth in the short term, they have also created the risk of significant market corrections and bubbles in the future.",
      "",
      "Another claim is that QE and low interest rates have exacerbated income inequality and have not necessarily led to sustainable economic growth. While QE has helped to keep interest rates low and stimulate borrowing and spending, it has also disproportionately benefited wealthy individuals and corporations who have access to capital markets. Furthermore, the long-term effects of QE on economic growth are uncertain, and there is concern that it may have led to a misallocation of resources and a proliferation of debt.",
      "",
      "Finally, low interest rates have made it difficult for central banks to address inflation and have limited their ability to respond to economic shocks. In many cases, low interest rates have led to a decline in the value of currencies and have made it more difficult for countries to service their debt. As a result, central banks may need to consider alternative monetary policies to address these challenges in the future.",
      "",
      "In conclusion, while QE and low interest rates have played a significant role in the past decade, their effects on the global economy have been mixed. They have helped to stimulate economic growth in the short term, but they have also created the risk of asset bubbles, exacerbated income inequality, and limited the ability of central banks to respond to economic shocks. As a result, it is important for policymakers to carefully consider the long-term implications of these policies and to develop a comprehensive monetary policy framework that balances growth, stability, and sustainability."

As a result, capital flows have shifted towards emerging economies, particularly those with high growth potential and relatively low borrowing costs.",

Firstly, it has led to an over-reliance on financial metrics to evaluate the performance of a company, which can result in a distorted view of its true value. This has been particularly problematic in the tech industry, where companies are often valued based on their growth potential rather than their current financial performance. This has resulted in a bubble-like situation where companies are valued highly even if they do not have a solid business model or revenue stream.",
      "",
      "Secondly, the overdose of financial measures has also led to a lack of diversity in the investment portfolios of many asset managers. As a result, they are heavily invested in a small number of stocks, which can make them vulnerable to market fluctuations. This can result in a situation where they are forced to sell their assets en masse, which can cause a sudden drop in the value of those assets.",
      "",
      "Finally, the overdose of financial measures has also led to a lack of emphasis on long-term value creation. Instead of focusing on the sustainability of a company's business model and its ability to generate profits over the long-term, many asset managers are instead focused on short-term gains. This has resulted in a situation where companies are pressured to prioritize short-term profits over long-term growth, which can ultimately harm their ability to create value for their shareholders.",

These cities have limited land available for development, which leads to a limited supply of housing. At the same time, these cities have a high demand for housing due to their desirable locations and growing populations. As a result, the demand for housing far exceeds the supply, which drives up prices.",
      "2. Another reason for the overpricing of residential properties in these cities is the influx of foreign investment. Foreign investors, particularly those from China, have been known to purchase properties in these cities, driving up prices and making it difficult for local residents to afford housing. This trend has been particularly pronounced in Vancouver, where the local government has attempted to address the issue by implementing foreign buyer taxes.",
      "3. Additionally, the growth of the technology sector in these cities has also contributed to the overpricing of residential properties. As technology companies expand and hire more employees, demand for housing in these areas increases, leading to higher prices.

The Burmese government has been in power for decades and has been criticized for its human rights record. However, any external intervention could be seen as a breach of sovereignty and an affront to the Burmese people's right to self-determination. This could further erode the government's legitimacy and undermine the prospects of a peaceful transition to democracy.",

      "Secondly, external intervention could lead to unintended consequences. External actors may not fully understand the complexities of Myanmar's political landscape and could inadvertently support the wrong groups or causes. This could lead to further conflict and instability, and undermine the prospects of a peaceful transition to democracy.",
      "",
      "Finally, external intervention could also have negative economic consequences. Myanmar is a developing country with a fragile economy, and any external intervention could disrupt its economic recovery and development.

From one perspective, China's rise to prominence as a global economic and military power has allowed it to pursue a strategy of expansion, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. This expansion has taken the form of infrastructure projects, such as the Belt and Road Initiative, which have allowed China to establish greater economic and political influence in the region. Additionally, China's military buildup in the South China Sea has allowed it to assert its territorial claims and establish a presence in the region.",

Additionally, Pakistan can implement prudent debt management policies, such as setting up debt-to-GDP ratios, to ensure that it can manage its debt levels effectively and avoid getting into a debt trap.",

      "In conclusion, Pakistan's high debt liabilities are a major concern for the sustainability of CPEC projects. To ensure the sustainability of CPEC projects, Pakistan needs to take measures to address its high debt liabilities, such as diversifying its sources of financing and implementing prudent debt management policies. By taking these measures, Pakistan can ensure the long-term sustainability of CPEC projects and promote economic cooperation and development between Pakistan and China."

They claim that China is extracting natural resources from Balochistan at a cheap rate and not sharing the profits with the local population. This has led to resentment among the Baloch people who feel that their resources are being exploited for the benefit of others.",

However, over the years, the MQM's focus has shifted, and it has become involved in various forms of political violence and corruption.",

      "Another reason is the lack of a viable alternative. The political landscape in Pakistan has been tumultuous in recent years, with frequent changes in government and political instability. In this context, the MQM has been able to capitalize on the lack of a strong, unified opposition, and has managed to maintain its position as a significant political force.",

    "output": [
      "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the relationship between politics and public health in the United States. First, the pandemic has highlighted the importance of public health in politics, as the government has been forced to prioritize the safety of its citizens over other political concerns. For example, the government has implemented lockdowns, travel restrictions, and other measures to prevent the spread of the virus, even if these measures have caused economic disruption or inconvenience. This has led to a greater recognition of the importance of public health in policymaking and a more collaborative relationship between the government and public health experts.",
      "",
      "Second, the pandemic has also brought attention to the role of politics in shaping public health policy. Political considerations, such as partisan differences and lobbying by special interest groups, have influenced the government's response to the pandemic. For example, some politicians have sought to politicize the pandemic, using it for their own gain or to advance their political agendas. This has led to a more polarized political landscape and a greater sense of distrust among the public.",
      "",
      "Finally, the pandemic has also highlighted the limitations of the traditional approach to public health in the United States. The government's response to the pandemic has been heavily influenced by the principles of market-based capitalism, which has led to a focus on individual responsibility and self-sufficiency. However, this approach has been criticized for failing to address the social and economic factors that contribute to the spread of infectious diseases, such as poverty and inequality. As a result, there is a growing call for a more comprehensive and equitable approach to public health that takes into account the social determinants of health."

Firstly, the pandemic has had a devastating impact on global economies, causing widespread job losses and financial instability. As such, it is essential that governments take all necessary measures to protect their citizens and stimulate economic growth. By prioritizing the development and distribution of vaccines, governments can help to mitigate the economic damage caused by the pandemic and support the recovery of their citizens and businesses.",

      "Secondly, free trade agreements have been criticized for exacerbating economic inequality and contributing to the spread of the pandemic. While free trade can bring economic benefits, it can also lead to job losses and the displacement of workers in vulnerable industries. In addition, the global supply chains that underpin many free trade agreements can make it difficult to control the spread of the virus. As such, it is important for governments to prioritize the health and wellbeing of their citizens over the interests of multinational corporations.",

The vaccines are safe and effective in preventing the spread of the virus, and their development and distribution are essential to containing the pandemic and protecting vulnerable populations. By prioritizing the development and distribution of vaccines, governments can help to reduce the number of cases and deaths caused by the virus, and support the recovery of their citizens and businesses.",

One key approach is to implement targeted trade restrictions, such as banning imports from countries with high case fatality rates or imposing quarantines on travelers from those countries. This approach allows for the protection of domestic public health while still preserving the benefits of international trade. Additionally, governments can provide financial support to affected industries, to help them weather the economic disruption caused by the pandemic. This can help to mitigate the negative impacts of trade restrictions on businesses and workers, while still protecting public health. Finally, governments can work with international partners to coordinate trade policies and share information on the spread of the pandemic, to ensure that trade restrictions are implemented in a coordinated and effective manner.

This can result in a situation where a country's military might is used as a tool for bullying and intimidation, rather than as a means of resolving conflicts peacefully.",
      "",
      "Furthermore, relying too heavily on lethality can lead to a dangerous arms race, where countries feel compelled to increase their military capabilities in order to maintain their status as a major military power. This can result in a significant increase in military spending, which can have negative economic consequences, such as inflation and a reduction in funding for social programs.",

This made it more difficult for IS to carry out attacks in the region, as they lacked the resources and leadership necessary to coordinate and plan operations.",

This reduced the motivation of supporters to carry out attacks in the name of IS, as they no longer felt that they were part of a winning movement.",

    "question": "4. Why is the South China Sea a flashpoint for tensions between China and the United States?",
    "output": [
      "The South China Sea is a flashpoint for tensions between China and the United States due to several reasons. Firstly, the South China Sea is a strategic waterway that connects the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and is rich in natural resources such as oil and gas. China claims most of the South China Sea, which has led to territorial disputes with several countries in the region, including Vietnam, the Philippines, and Taiwan. The United States, as a major maritime power, has a significant interest in ensuring the free flow of commerce and the security of the seas in the region.",
      "",
      "Secondly, the United States has been critical of China's expansionism in the South China Sea, which has been seen as a threat to regional stability. China's construction of artificial islands, military installations, and the deployment of advanced military assets in the region have been viewed as attempts to assert its dominance and undermine the sovereignty of other countries. The United States has been vocal in its opposition to China's actions, and has been conducting freedom of navigation operations in the region to challenge China's claims.",
      "",
      "Finally, the South China Sea is also a source of nationalism and pride for China, which sees the region as a vital part of its territorial integrity. China's claims to the South China Sea are based on a historical narrative that dates back thousands of years, and the Chinese government has been quick to assert its rights in the region. This has led to tensions with other countries in the region, who view China's actions as aggressive and expansionist.",

The United States has a significant interest in ensuring the stability of the region, while China sees the South China Sea as a vital part of its territorial integrity."

    "output": [
      "Japan's growing concern over China's behavior in the South China Sea has affected their strategic rivalry in several ways. Firstly, it has led to an increase in military cooperation between Japan and its allies, such as the United States, in order to counterbalance China's growing influence in the region. This includes joint naval exercises and the deployment of military assets to the region. Secondly, Japan's concerns over China's territorial claims in the South China Sea have led to a strengthening of economic ties with other countries in the region, such as Vietnam and the Philippines, in order to diversify its energy and resource supplies. This has the potential to further isolate China and reduce its influence in the region. Finally, Japan's concerns over China's behavior in the South China Sea have led to increased attention being paid to the issue of freedom of navigation in the region, with Japan calling for greater transparency and accountability in Chinese military activities. This has the potential to further escalate tensions between Japan and China and contribute to their strategic rivalry."

The United States has criticized China's aggressive actions in the region, including the construction of artificial islands and the militarization of these islands.
