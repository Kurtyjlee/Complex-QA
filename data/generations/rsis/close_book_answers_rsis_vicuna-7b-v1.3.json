    "question": "2. What is the historical background of free trade in the world economy?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The concept of free trade has a long history in the world economy. The idea of free trade is based on the principle of removing barriers to trade, such as tariffs and quotas, and allowing goods and services to flow freely across borders. The earliest known example of free trade is believed to be the ancient trade routes that existed between Mesopotamia and Egypt around 2000 BC.",
      "During the medieval period, trade was largely conducted through guilds, which were organizations of merchants and artisans who controlled the production and distribution of goods and services within a particular trade. This system of trade was characterized by high tariffs and other barriers to trade, which made it difficult for outsiders to participate in the trade.",
      "The modern era of free trade began in the late 19th century with the formation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947. This organization was designed to promote free trade by reducing tariffs and other barriers to trade. The GATT was later replaced by the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995, which has continued to promote free trade as a means of promoting economic growth and development.",
      "Overall, the history of free trade in the world economy has been characterized by a gradual movement towards greater openness and liberalization of trade. While there have been setbacks and challenges along the way, the general trend has been towards greater freedom of trade and the removal of barriers to trade."

    "close_book_answer": [
      "The US shift towards protectionism has had a significant impact on other countries. One of the most notable impacts is the rise in trade tensions and conflicts between the US and its trading partners. The US has implemented tariffs on imports from countries such as China, Mexico, and Canada, which has led to retaliatory measures from these countries. This has resulted in a decline in global trade and has had a negative impact on the economies of other countries.",
      "Another impact of the US shift towards protectionism is the loss of competitiveness for US companies in the global market. By implementing tariffs and other protectionist measures, the US is making it more difficult for its companies to compete with foreign companies in the global market. This has led to a decline in US exports and has had a negative impact on the US economy.",
      "Finally, the US shift towards protectionism has also had a negative impact on the US's reputation as a reliable trading partner. By imposing tariffs and other protectionist measures, the US is seen as being less committed to free trade and more interested in protecting its domestic industries. This has led to a decline in trust and confidence in the US as a trading partner, which has had a negative impact on its ability to negotiate favorable trade deals in the future."

By improving connectivity, countries in the region can reduce the costs and time associated with trade, making it easier for businesses to participate in global value chains.",
      "2. Another strategy for promoting regional integration is through the establishment of free trade agreements (FTAs) between countries in the region. FTAs can reduce tariffs and other barriers to trade, making it easier for businesses to operate across borders. This can lead to increased trade and investment, as well as the creation of new jobs and economic growth.",
      "3. Finally, Asia can promote regional integration by promoting the development of digital technologies and e-commerce. This can help businesses in the region to participate in global value chains by allowing them to reach new markets and customers.

    "close_book_answer": [
      "The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multisectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) is a regional intergovernmental organization established in 1997, with the headquarters in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It is comprised of seven member states, which are Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Myanmar. The primary objective of BIMSTEC is to promote economic, technical, and cultural cooperation among its member states, with a focus on the development of the region.",
      "The significance of BIMSTEC in the Indo-Pacific region lies in its potential to promote regional integration, trade, and investment. The organization has a significant role in fostering economic cooperation and regional connectivity, which can help in promoting sustainable economic growth and development in the region. BIMSTEC can also serve as a platform for member states to collaborate on regional and global issues, such as climate change, disaster management, and terrorism.",
      "Moreover, BIMSTEC can play a crucial role in promoting the interests of the smaller and less developed countries in the region, which can help in reducing their dependence on larger economies and enhancing their economic resilience. The organization can also contribute to the promotion of cultural exchange and people-to-people contacts among its member states, which can help in fostering a sense of regional identity and belonging.",
      "In conclusion, BIMSTEC is a significant regional organization in the Indo-Pacific region, as it has the potential to promote economic cooperation, regional integration, and connectivity, as well as contribute to the promotion of the interests of smaller and less developed countries in the region."

      "This notion assumes that the growing economic, geopolitical and securit y connections between the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean regions are creating a shared strategic space.",
      "The Bay is evolving as the centre of the Indo-Pacif ic region again.",
      "The renewed focus has given a new lease of life to the developmental efforts in the region, in particular the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multisectoral Tech nical and Economic Cooperation or BIMSTEC.",
      "Outlining Changes To revive the region as a distinct community and to promote regional cooperation among the Bay of Bengal\u2019s littoral states, BIMSTEC was established on 6 June 1997 as a regional organisation comprising seven states (five from South Asia: Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka; and two from So utheast Asia: Myanmar and Thailand).",
      "As the BIMSTEC process enters the third decade of i ts existence, it has yet to make visible progress in advancing concrete cooperation among the member states.",
      "In the last two years, however, member states have investe d some fresh energy to make BIMSTEC a valuable institution for regional integra tion and collaboration.",

      "The growing value of BIMSTEC and its attempt to generate synergy through collective efforts by memb er states, can be understood, for three key reasons.",
      "First, there is a greater appreciation of BIMSTEC\u2019s potential due to the geographical contiguity, abundant natural and human resources, r ich historical linkages and cultural heritage for promoting deeper cooperation in the re gion.",

      "Connectivity is essenti al to develop a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable Bay of Bengal region.",

    "question": "3. What impact has the introduction of QE and low interest rates had on financial markets?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The introduction of Quantitative Easing (QE) and low interest rates has had a significant impact on financial markets. Here are three key claims supported by evidence:",
      "1. QE has increased liquidity in financial markets: QE has increased the money supply, which has led to increased liquidity in financial markets. This has made it easier for investors to trade and has also increased the demand for assets, leading to rising prices. For example, in the United States, the Federal Reserve's QE program led to a significant increase in the stock market and a surge in bond prices.",
      "2. Low interest rates have encouraged risk-taking: Low interest rates have encouraged investors to take on more risk in search of higher returns. This has led to an increase in speculative activity and has also made it easier for governments and corporations to borrow at low rates. However, this has also increased the risk of financial instability, as low interest rates can mask the true cost of borrowing and may encourage excessive risk-taking.",
      "3. QE and low interest rates have created asset price bubbles: The use of QE and low interest rates has led to the creation of asset price bubbles in some markets. For example, in the United States, there have been concerns that the housing market may be in a bubble due to low interest rates and government policies that have encouraged homeownership. Similarly, in some emerging markets, there have been concerns that asset prices, such as stocks and real estate, may be overvalued due to easy monetary policies.",
      "Overall, the impact of QE and low interest rates on financial markets has been mixed. While they have increased liquidity and encouraged risk-taking, they have also created the potential for asset price bubbles and increased the risk of financial instability."

      "The surge in foreign buying of emerging-market bonds has both positive and negative effects. On the positive side, it can help to reduce risk premiums and lower borrowing costs for emerging-market governments, making it easier for them to borrow and invest in their economies. This, in turn, can stimulate economic growth and create jobs. Additionally, foreign investment can also bring in new capital and expertise, which can help to improve the quality of government bonds and make them more attractive to investors.",
      "However, there are also negative effects to consider. The increased demand for emerging-market bonds can put upward pressure on bond prices, which can lead to higher inflation rates and currency depreciation. This can make it more difficult for emerging-market economies to service their debt, and it can also increase the risk of default. Furthermore, the influx of foreign capital can also lead to a loss of control over the country's economic policies, as foreign investors may have different priorities and agendas than the government.",
      "In conclusion, the surge in foreign buying of emerging-market bonds can have both positive and negative effects, and it is important to carefully consider the potential risks and benefits before making any investment decisions."

      "Commentary OVER THE course of the past decade, the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the fear of a repeat of the 1930 Great Depression had led to the globally concerted efforts by all the major central banks to pursue the unprecede nted monetary measures of quantitative easing (QE) and near zero or below zer o interest rates.",
      "Despite the huge sacrifice to the tune of trillions of dollars pumped into the financial system by taxpayers, the past decade was known or l abelled as The Advanced Economies\u2019 Lost Decade.",
      "Profit Maximisation At the onset of the global financial crisis in 2007 /2008 originating from the United States subprime mortgage crisis, most countries aro und the world suffered various shocks.",
      "These ranged from a liquidity crunch to dow nward pressures on asset prices due to the interconnectedness of global financial m arkets.",
      "For most parts of the past decade (2008-2018), the G3 economies (the US, European Union, and Japan) had been on the decline and were relatively less healthy than the emerging economies and some developed countries suc h as Australia and Canada.",
      "However, soon after the introduction of QE and hist orically low interest rates, capital flows arising from QE shifted towards the markets o utside of the G3 economies, where short-term relative returns were high and where the re was greater capacity to absorb funds.",
      "This extensive overdose of financial measures had c reated a distorted demand in different assets.",
      "These included the surge in foreign buying of emerging-market bonds as well as urban housing in a number of cities \u2014 a variant of the ghost cities problem in China.",
      "Overpriced Properties By 2014, cities such as Vancouver and Toronto in Ca nada, Auckland in New Zealand, and Sydney and Melbourne in Australia were sufferin g overpriced residential properties, with price-to-income ratios at historic al highs.",
      "As a result, many professionals were priced out of the market in thes e cities; at the same time, a number of investors were prepared to own empty houses with the anticipation of further appreciation in prices.",
      "The 2013 McKinsey Global Institute Studies had observed that the emerging-market bonds outstanding has climbed by US$5 trillion sinc e 2008, despite the fact only an estimated 15 percent of the overall bond market was foreign owned.",
      "Subsequently, following the statements issued by th e US Federal Reserve in May and June 2013 indicating the intention of tightening mo netary policy in late 2013, more than 10 percent decline was observed in the emergin g-market equity and aggregate bond indexes between April and August.",
      "Change of Fortune Yet, we observe two divergent trends in the West.",
      "EU still faces a number of uncertainties \u0336 the huge surge of refugees from the Middle East and North Africa creates an identity crisis fo r the European population.",
      "In addition, Brexit has caught the EU off-guard.",
      "To gether with youth unemployment and the rise of nationalism in many EU Member State s, this has instigated many within the EU to clarify the EU vision and purpose in the run-up to the European elections in 2019.",
      "In contrast, since 2017, the US - the ground zero o f the last global financial crisis - has experienced changing fortunes.",
      "In October 2017, the US Federal Reserve took a decision to terminate QE and to gradually increase interest rates in 2018.",
      "Coupled with the upward revision of the US economic growth, improvement in household purchases, enhanced employment opportunit ies since late 2016 and lower taxes under the Trump Administration, the reversal of QE has led to a rebound in asset markets, company mergers and stock buybacks.",
      "Furthermore, data compiled by the University of Flo rida as reported in the Wall Street Journal showed that 83 percent of the US-listed initial pu blic offerings (IPO) in 2018\u2019s first three quarters had lost money in the year lea ding up to their IPO.",
      "For example, the company SurveyMonkey experienced a 40 percent jump in share prices after its IPO in September 2018, despite never posting a prof itable year.",
      "Extreme Economic Weather All the above observations can be attributed to QEs influencing the financial market due to their quantum and domino effects on the fund management community globally.",
      "Furthermore, the principle of arbitrage - taking ad vantage of price differences - has directly or indirectly created the herd instinct fo r the movement and direction on the flow of funds.",
      "In addition, for decades, the advocacy of the free flow of capital by the internationalist and liberal West was based on their belief in the i mportance of an \u201cefficient market hypothesis\u201d in the market-based economy - without r ealizing how this would facilitate the formation of an economic bubble in the era post -global financial crisis.",
      "In line with the rise of footloose capital, the lau nch of QE measures over the past decade has been followed by a rapid influx of capit al into real estate, stock and bond markets in emerging economies and selective develop ed economies that are less affected by the global financial crisis.",
      "As the corollary of the \u201cefficient market hypothesi s\u201d, the frequent \u201cdrought and flood\u201d phenomenon in movements of funds as experienced by the emerging markets are synonymous with the sudden shocks of \u201cextreme econo mic weather conditions\u201d due to the policy stances of the G3 central banks.",
      "In other words, many economies in the emerging mark ets are like farmers without the means of installing a proper irrigation control sys tem in their financial sector.",
      "They are facing the volatile forces of \u201cdrought and flood\u201d i n their economies within a day or shorter.",
      "Probability of Currency Meltdown The US is, once again, perceived as the safe haven and land of opportunities as massive funds are flowing back to the US where inve stor sentiments and herd instinct behaviour are unmatched even with respect to the dot.com era in 2000.",
      "As of early 2018, the global debt had increased clo se to US$247 trillion - about 300 percent of the global annual output.",
      "In parallel, t he drumbeats of the currency crises in the emerging markets are getting louder and wher e unfortunately the \u201cirrigation control valve\u201d is not in the hands of those in char ge in the emerging markets.",

He emphasized the importance of cooperation and mutual respect between nations, and he sought to build a more harmonious and stable world order.",

    "question": "3. Why has there been limited activism in the military arena in response to China's transgressions?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "In recent years, China's increasing aggression in the South China Sea has raised concerns among neighboring countries, including the Philippines. However, despite the potential for military action, there has been limited activism in response to China's transgressions. One reason for this is that the Philippines has limited military capabilities compared to China. China has a large and modern military force, including advanced aircraft carriers and submarines, while the Philippines has a smaller and less advanced military force. Additionally, the Philippines has a long history of conflict with China, dating back to the 1970s, and has been hesitant to engage in military action due to the potential for significant casualties.",
      "Another reason for the limited activism in the military arena is that the Philippines has pursued diplomatic solutions to address China's transgressions. The Philippines has sought support from the international community, including the United States, and has engaged in negotiations with China to resolve disputes peacefully. This approach has been criticized by some as being too soft, but it has allowed the Philippines to maintain diplomatic relations with China and avoid further escalation of tensions.",
      "Finally, the Philippine government has faced significant domestic challenges, including poverty, corruption, and political instability, which have limited its ability to focus on military action. The government has prioritized economic development and social welfare over military expansion, and has sought to maintain good relations with China to avoid jeopardizing economic ties.",
      "In conclusion, the limited activism in the military arena in response to China's transgressions in the South China Sea is due to a combination of factors, including the Philippines' limited military capabilities, the pursuit of diplomatic solutions, and domestic challenges. While military action may be necessary in some cases, it is important to consider the potential consequences and pursue diplomatic solutions whenever possible."

    "question": "4. How has China managed to prevent a hard-balancing coalition from emerging?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The question of how China has managed to prevent a hard-balancing coalition from emerging is a crucial one, as it speaks to the ability of great powers to cooperate or compete in a complex global environment. In this case, China has managed to prevent a hard-balancing coalition from emerging through a combination of strategies, including economic engagement, diplomatic outreach, and the use of strategic communication.",
      "Firstly, China has used economic engagement to prevent other countries from cooperating against it. By providing investment and loans to countries in the region, China has been able to establish a level of economic dependence that makes it difficult for these countries to cooperate against it. This is particularly true for countries that are heavily reliant on Chinese investment, such as Cambodia and Laos.",
      "Secondly, China has used diplomatic outreach to build partnerships with other countries in the region. By offering development aid and investment, China has been able to build relationships with countries that it sees as important to its regional ambitions. This has allowed China to prevent a coalition from emerging by ensuring that these countries are not aligned against it.",
      "Finally, China has used strategic communication to shape the narrative around its actions in the region. By presenting its activities in the South China Sea as defensive in nature, China has been able to prevent other countries from coalescing around a common position against it. By framing its actions as a response to the actions of other countries, China has been able to create a narrative that has prevented a hard-balancing coalition from emerging.",
      "In conclusion, China has managed to prevent a hard-balancing coalition from emerging in the South China Sea through a combination of economic engagement, diplomatic outreach, and strategic communication. By building partnerships, shaping the narrative, and leveraging economic dependence, China has been able to prevent a coalition from emerging that could challenge its regional ambitions."

      "The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) officially entered into force on 1 January 2022 \u2500 a massive free trade agreement (FTA) covering about 30 percent of the world\u2019s population and global GDP.",
      "Critics argue that RCEP is a shallow agreement compared to the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans -Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) that was praised as the gold standard of trade deals.",
      "However, a closer look reveals that RCEP will promote further trade integration and facilitat ion of the Asia -Pacific region as it harmonises and consolidates bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs) among member countries while galvanising regional supply chains.",
      "Benefits of Participating in RCEP There are at least four benefits of participation i n RCEP.",
      "The first concerns RCEP\u2019s trade liberalisation effects.",
      "Critics argue that RCEP does not yield large tariff reductions because several parties have already formed bilateral trade agreements, especially through ASEAN -Plus-One FTAs.",
      "Some also point out that RCEP will bring in gradual tariff reduction in the region as its tariff concessions remove tariffs on 92% of goods traded within the bloc with an implementation period of 20 years, while allowing for exemptions for sensitive sectors.",
      "However, this argument downplays RCEP\u2019s core trade liberalisation effects, which stem from some of its specific features.",

The main benefits of participating in RCEP include increased trade and investment opportunities, improved market access, and increased economic growth.",
      "One key benefit of RCEP is that it will increase trade and investment opportunities between the member countries. This will lead to the creation of new jobs and increased economic growth. The agreement will also promote the flow of goods, services, and investment between the member countries, which will help to boost economic growth.",
      "Another benefit of RCEP is improved market access. The agreement will eliminate tariffs and other trade barriers, making it easier for businesses to trade with each other. This will help to increase exports and imports, leading to increased economic growth.",
      "Finally, RCEP will promote economic integration and cooperation among the member countries. This will help to strengthen the regional economy and promote sustainable economic growth.",

    "close_book_answer": [
      "RCEP and CPTPP are two significant free trade agreements in the Asia-Pacific region. While both agreements aim to promote trade and investment liberalization, they have different trade liberalization effects.",
      "Firstly, RCEP is a more comprehensive agreement compared to CPTPP. RCEP includes all 10 ASEAN member states and six of its FTA partners, including China, Japan, South Korea, and Australia. This extensive membership means that RCEP has a larger market size and can potentially bring about more significant trade liberalization effects compared to CPTPP.",
      "Secondly, RCEP has a more extensive coverage of trade and investment issues compared to CPTPP. RCEP includes chapters on goods, services, investment, economic and technical cooperation, intellectual property, and e-commerce, among others. In contrast, CPTPP has a more limited coverage, focusing mainly on goods trade and investment liberalization.",
      "Lastly, RCEP has stronger protection for intellectual property rights compared to CPTPP. RCEP includes provisions for the protection of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, and copyrights. This strengthened protection can attract more foreign investment, particularly in the technology sector.",
      "In conclusion, RCEP has the potential to bring about more significant trade liberalization effects compared to CPTPP due to its more comprehensive membership, extensive coverage of trade and investment issues, and stronger protection for intellectual property rights."

RCEP is designed to promote trade integration and facilitation in the Asia-Pacific region by enhancing economic cooperation and reducing barriers to trade. Here are three specific features of RCEP that promote trade integration and facilitation:",
      "1. Elimination of Tariffs: RCEP aims to eliminate tariffs on goods and services traded among its member countries, which will reduce trade costs and increase economic cooperation. By reducing tariffs, RCEP will encourage cross-border trade and investment, leading to increased economic growth and job creation in the region.",
      "2. Liberalization of Services Trade: RCEP seeks to liberalize trade in services, including financial services, telecommunications, and transportation. This will promote competition and increase access to services for businesses and consumers, which will lead to lower prices and improved quality of services.",
      "3. Regulatory Cooperation: RCEP includes provisions for regulatory cooperation, which will promote greater consistency and predictability in the regulatory environment across the region. This will reduce barriers to trade and investment, encourage innovation, and promote sustainable development.",

While the RCEP offers significant benefits to member countries, there are also potential challenges or drawbacks that need to be addressed.",
      "One potential challenge of RCEP is the lack of balance in the agreement. Some countries, such as Vietnam and Malaysia, have expressed concerns that the agreement may not be balanced, with some sectors being opened up to trade while others remain closed. This lack of balance could lead to winners and losers among member countries, with some industries being hurt by increased competition.",

RCEP aims to reduce tariffs and other barriers to trade, which could lead to increased competition for domestic industries. This could result in job losses and economic disruption, particularly in industries that are already struggling.",

      "After World War II, the United States played a crucial role in establishing the global economic architecture that exists today. One key contribution was the creation of the Bretton Woods system, which established a new international monetary system that pegged the value of the US dollar to gold and facilitated international trade and investment. The system also led to the creation of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, both of which were designed to promote economic growth and stability around the world.",
      "Another important contribution of the United States was the creation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which established a framework for international trade and set the foundation for the modern World Trade Organization (WTO). The US also played a key role in the creation of the United Nations, which has since become a key player in international diplomacy and conflict resolution.",

    "question": "5. What are the two ways in which the context in which the global economic institutions operate has changed?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "In the past, the global economic institutions operated in a context where the world was more homogeneous, with a dominant Western power and a relatively stable global economic system. However, today's global economic institutions operate in a vastly different context. The world has become increasingly heterogeneous, with the rise of emerging economies, and the global economic system is characterized by greater instability and volatility. These changes have significant implications for the effectiveness of global economic institutions in addressing current economic challenges.",
      "Firstly, the rise of emerging economies has led to a more diverse global economic landscape, with different countries having different economic priorities and policies. This has made it more difficult for global economic institutions to reach consensus on policy issues and has led to more fragmented responses to global economic challenges. For example, the global economic institutions have struggled to come to a consensus on issues related to climate change, with developing countries resisting measures that could impact their economic growth.",
      "Secondly, the global economic system is characterized by greater instability and volatility, with the COVID-19 pandemic being a prime example. This has made it more difficult for global economic institutions to predict and respond to economic shocks, and has highlighted the limitations of their existing governance structures. For example, the global economic institutions were criticized for their slow response to the pandemic, with some arguing that their governance structures were not adequate for dealing with a crisis of this magnitude.",
      "In conclusion, the context in which global economic institutions operate has changed significantly, with the rise of emerging economies and the increasing instability and volatility of the global economic system. These changes have significant implications for the effectiveness of global economic institutions in addressing current economic challenges, and highlight the need for reform and adaptation to meet the needs of the changing global economic landscape."

This proposal was initially put forward by the Economist magazine in 2013, and has since been endorsed by a range of economists and policymakers, including Paul Krugman, Joseph Stiglitz, and Jeffrey Sachs.",
      "The New Bretton Woods proposal seeks to establish a new international monetary system that is more stable, equitable, and resilient to financial crises. This system would be based on a broader set of currencies, including the Chinese yuan, the Indian rupee, and the Russian ruble, in addition to the US dollar. The proposal also envisages the creation of a new global financial safety net that would provide liquidity and insurance to the global financial system during times of stress.",
      "The New Bretton Woods proposal has been met with both support and criticism. Supporters argue that the current global financial system is too unstable and too prone to crises, and that a new system is needed to prevent future crises. Critics, on the other hand, argue that the proposal is overly ambitious and may not be feasible in practice. Nevertheless, the New Bretton Woods proposal has sparked an important debate about the future of the global financial and economic system, and has helped to focus attention on the need for systemic reform."

    "close_book_answer": [
      "The onset of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) in Balochistan has had a significant impact on the Baloch groups. The CPEC is a multi-billion-dollar infrastructure project that aims to connect China's western region to the Gwadar Port in Balochistan, Pakistan. The project is expected to provide a trade route for China to access the Arabian Sea and is seen as a game-changer for the region. However, the Baloch groups have been critical of the project, arguing that it will displace them from their land and resources and that the benefits of the project will not reach them.",
      "The Baloch groups have been fighting for their rights and autonomy in Balochistan for decades. They argue that the province has been historically neglected and marginalized by the central government in Islamabad. The CPEC has further exacerbated their grievances as they feel that their land is being taken away from them without adequate compensation or consultation. The Baloch National Front, an opposition party in Balochistan, has stated that the CPEC is a \"colossal disaster\" for the people of Balochistan and that it will lead to the exploitation of their resources.",
      "The Baloch groups have resorted to violence in their fight for autonomy. The Baloch Liberation Army, a militant group, has carried out several attacks on CPEC infrastructure, including the bombing of a motorway construction site in 2019. The government has responded with force, with security forces launching operations in Balochistan to crack down on militancy. The military operation has led to allegations of human rights abuses and displacement of locals.",
      "In conclusion, the onset of the CPEC in Balochistan has had a significant impact on the Baloch groups. The project has further exacerbated their grievances and led to violence and human rights abuses.

      "The Historic German Volte -face Despite being the second largest NATO economy, hitherto, it was hopeless to expect Germany to meet its NATO defence budget obligations of 2% of GDP.",
      "Berlin\u2019s strategic culture , domestic politics and an entrenched public pacificism made raising the defence budget as difficult as developing a realistic security strategy appropriate for a country so prone to geopolitical challenges.",
      "Likewise, the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with Moscow was long a \u201choly cow\u201d of Berlin\u2019s diplomacy, preventing both the export of arms to Ukraine as wel l as unambiguously joining its NATO allies in hard -balancing Russian influence.",

      "Likewise, to reduce Germany\u2019s significant dependency on Russian energy imports (every fourth household relies on Russian gas for heating), even Green party leaders agree tha t Berlin will now likely have to postpone its exit from both coal - and nuclear - energy, and Nordstream 2 is now all but finished.",

      "This cooperative spirit is, however, highly dependent on personalities rather than permanent structural change of US foreign policy.",
      "It is indeed likely that a second Trump administration had reacted very differently, side -lining rather than galvanis ing European cooperation, which would likely have led to political inertia rather than resolve in Europe.",

    "question": "2. What is the significance of Germany's decision to equip its armed forces and think strategically about the defence of and challenges for Germany and Europe?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The significance of Germany's decision to equip its armed forces and think strategically about the defense of and challenges for Germany and Europe is multifaceted. Firstly, it demonstrates Germany's commitment to playing a more active role in European and global security. By investing in its military capabilities, Germany is signaling that it is willing to take on greater responsibility for its own security and the security of its allies. This is particularly important given the increasing complexity and uncertainty of the security landscape, with threats such as terrorism, cyberattacks, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.",
      "Secondly, the decision to equip its armed forces and think strategically is a response to the changing security environment in Europe. With the end of the Cold War and the rise of new security challenges, Germany and other European countries have had to adapt their defense policies to meet new threats. By investing in its military capabilities and developing a more strategic approach to defense, Germany is demonstrating its commitment to playing its part in addressing these challenges.",
      "Finally, the decision to equip its armed forces and think strategically is also significant for Germany's relationship with the United States and NATO. While Germany has long been a member of NATO and has contributed to international security through its participation in peacekeeping missions and other military operations, it has been reluctant to invest heavily in its own military capabilities. By investing in its military capabilities and taking a more strategic approach to defense, Germany is signaling its commitment to NATO and its role in supporting the alliance's goals and objectives."

      "Berlin\u2019s strategic culture , domestic politics and an entrenched public pacificism made raising the defence budget as difficult as developing a realistic security strategy appropriate for a country so prone to geopolitical challenges.",

      "The Armed Forces of the Philippines' Western Mindanao Command (Westmincom) has employed a multi-pronged strategy to diminish the capabilities of the IS-affiliated Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) in Sulu, Basilan, and Tawi-Tawi provinces. This strategy involves a combination of military operations, intelligence gathering, and community engagement.",
      "Firstly, Westmincom has conducted numerous military operations against ASG, aiming to disrupt their capabilities and limit their ability to carry out attacks. These operations have resulted in the killing or capture of key ASG leaders and the disruption of their supply lines. Additionally, Westmincom has been working to build the capacity of the Philippine military to better respond to security threats in the region, including through the provision of training and equipment.",
      "Secondly, Westmincom has been working to gather intelligence on ASG, including their movements, activities, and networks. This has involved the use of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) assets, as well as the coordination with local communities to gather information. By improving its intelligence capabilities, Westmincom has been able to better anticipate and respond to ASG attacks.",
      "Finally, Westmincom has been engaging with local communities in Sulu, Basilan, and Tawi-Tawi provinces to build trust and cooperation. This has involved working with local leaders to address underlying grievances and promote economic development in the region. By building strong relationships with local communities, Westmincom has been able to limit the support that ASG receives from within the population.",
      "In conclusion, Westmincom's strategy to diminish the capabilities of IS-affiliated ASG in Sulu, Basilan, and Tawi-Tawi provinces involves a combination of military operations, intelligence gathering, and community engagement. By taking a comprehensive approach to addressing the security threat posed by ASG, Westmincom has been able to make significant progress in reducing their capabilities and limiting their ability to carry out attacks."

      "It is worth noting in this regard that in the same clip featuring Uqayl, another Malaysian militant identified as Muhammad Aqif Heusen Rahizat , assured supporters that if they cannot make it to Syria to join ISIS Central, they could do so in their respective countries.",
      "The clarion call to would-be lone wolves could not be clearer: carry out attacks wherever you are.",

    "question": "2. What is the significance of the video clip featuring Megat Shahdan Abdul Samad (Abu Uqayl)?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The video clip featuring Megat Shahdan Abdul Samad (Abu Uqayl) is significant as it highlights the growing trend of online radicalization in Malaysia, particularly among the younger generation. This clip serves as a cautionary tale for parents and educators to be vigilant in identifying signs of radicalization in their children and to take proactive measures to prevent them from being drawn into extremist ideologies.",
      "Firstly, the clip showcases the ease with which young individuals can be radicalized online, as Abu Uqayl was able to recruit other young Malaysians to join ISIS without much difficulty. This underscores the need for parents and educators to be aware of the potential risks of social media and online platforms, and to monitor their children's online activities to prevent them from being exposed to extremist content.",
      "Secondly, the clip highlights the importance of de-radicalization programs and initiatives in addressing the issue of online radicalization. The Malaysian government has implemented various programs to counter radicalization, such as the \"Stop 101\" campaign, which aims to counter the narrative of ISIS recruiters. However, more needs to be done to address the root causes of radicalization, such as poverty, inequality, and lack of opportunities, and to provide support to individuals who may be at risk of radicalization.",
      "Finally, the clip serves as a reminder of the urgent need for a comprehensive and coordinated approach to countering violent extremism. This includes addressing the root causes of radicalization, preventing individuals from being radicalized in the first place, and addressing the security threats posed by foreign terrorist fighters who return to their home countries. It is only through a collective effort by governments, civil society, and the private sector that we can effectively counter the threat of online radicalization and ensure the safety and security of our communities."

    "question": "3. How does the video clip impact the perception of ISIS supporters towards non-Muslims?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The video clip in question depicts the speaker discussing the concept of \"taqiyya\" and its relevance to non-Muslims. The speaker asserts that non-Muslims should not be considered as \"infidels\" and should be treated with respect. This viewpoint aligns with the concept of \"taqiyya\" which is a principle in Islam that allows Muslims to conceal their beliefs in certain situations where their safety or well-being may be at risk.",
      "This message has the potential to impact the perception of ISIS supporters towards non-Muslims. The speaker's viewpoint emphasizes the importance of treating non-Muslims with respect and not judging them based on their religion. This is a contrast to the ISIS's propaganda which often portrays non-Muslims as enemies and justifies violence against them.",
      "Furthermore, the speaker's message of tolerance and respect for non-Muslims is in line with the principles of Islam, which promotes the idea of peace and coexistence with other religions. This can help to challenge the narrative of ISIS which promotes a radical and exclusive interpretation of Islam.",
      "In conclusion, the video clip has the potential to impact the perception of ISIS supporters towards non-Muslims by promoting a message of tolerance and respect. This is in contrast to the ISIS's propaganda which often portrays non-Muslims as enemies and justifies violence against them. The speaker's message aligns with the principles of Islam which promotes peace and coexistence with other religions."

    "question": "4. What is the significance of the tactical bar being lowered for staging violent attacks?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "In the context of staging violent attacks, the tactical bar being lowered can have significant implications for the effectiveness of such tactics. Lowering the tactical bar refers to reducing the level of sophistication or planning required to execute a violent attack. This can make it easier for individuals or groups to carry out attacks, even if they lack the resources or expertise of more sophisticated actors.",
      "One key claim is that lowering the tactical bar can increase the frequency and lethality of violent attacks. By reducing the level of planning and coordination required, individuals or groups may be more likely to carry out attacks, and these attacks may be more successful. This can lead to a rise in the number of casualties and a greater impact on public safety.",
      "Another claim is that lowering the tactical bar can have a destabilizing effect on society. When attacks become more frequent and less predictable, individuals may feel more fear and insecurity, which can lead to a breakdown in social cohesion and trust. This can have a ripple effect on other aspects of society, such as economic stability and political stability.",
      "Finally, another claim is that lowering the tactical bar can be counterproductive for extremist groups. While lowering the bar may make it easier for some individuals to carry out attacks, it may also make it easier for law enforcement and intelligence agencies to detect and prevent attacks. This can undermine the credibility of extremist groups and reduce their ability to recruit new members."

    "close_book_answer": [
      "Abu Uqayl's injunction to kill \"unbelievers\" and \"apostates\" from East Asia to Africa holds significant implications for the Islamic world. Firstly, it emphasizes the need for strict adherence to Islamic law and doctrine, which can be interpreted as a call for religious purity and uniformity. This can lead to a narrow-minded view of the world, where non-Muslims and those who do not follow the strict interpretation of Islam are seen as inferior and deserving of death.",
      "Secondly, Abu Uqayl's injunction can be seen as a call for violence and extremism, which can be detrimental to interfaith relations and global peace. It promotes a view of Islam that is divisive and intolerant, and can be used to justify violence and terrorism. This can lead to a cycle of violence and retribution, which can be harmful to both Muslims and non-Muslims.",
      "Lastly, Abu Uqayl's injunction can be seen as a violation of human rights and international law. It promotes the idea that certain individuals or groups can be killed without due process or trial, which is a violation of basic human rights. This can be seen as a call for the establishment of a theocratic state, where the ruling elite has the power to interpret and enforce Islamic law without any checks or balances.",
      "In conclusion, Abu Uqayl's injunction to kill \"unbelievers\" and \"apostates\" from East Asia to Africa is significant because it highlights the need for strict adherence to Islamic law and doctrine, can be used to justify violence and extremism, and can be seen as a violation of human rights and international law."

    "question": "1. How does climate change affect global agricultural production and food security?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "Climate change has a significant impact on global agricultural production and food security. The changes in temperature, precipitation, and weather patterns can affect crop yields and the availability of fresh water, which are crucial for agricultural production. According to a study by the International Food Policy Research Institute, climate change is likely to reduce global crop yields by up to 25% by the year 2050, which can lead to food insecurity and increased food prices. Additionally, climate change can also cause displacement of people from their homes due to droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events, which can further exacerbate food insecurity.",
      "Moreover, the effects of climate change are not uniform across the world. Developing countries, which are already facing food insecurity, are likely to be the most affected by climate change. For example, droughts in sub-Saharan Africa can lead to food shortages and malnutrition, which can have a devastating impact on the health and well-being of the population. In contrast, developed countries have the resources and infrastructure to adapt to the effects of climate change, but they still need to take action to mitigate their greenhouse gas emissions to avoid exacerbating the problem.",
      "In conclusion, climate change poses a significant threat to global agricultural production and food security. The negative impacts of climate change can lead to food insecurity, increased food prices, and displacement of people from their homes. Developing countries are likely to be the most affected by climate change, and it is essential for all countries to take action to mitigate their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the effects of climate change."

Firstly, the US government' assistance to farmers and agribusinesses is expected to continue under the administration of Joe Biden. This will likely result in increased subsidies for US farmers and support for domestic agribusinesses, which could disadvantage foreign competitors, particularly in China. This could lead to an increase in the price of food for consumers in the US, but could also lead to an increase in the supply of food available to other countries.",
      "Secondly, the increasing competition between China and the US in the agricultural technology sector could lead to a race to the bottom in terms of environmental standards and regulations. This could result in a decrease in the quality of food produced, particularly in China, and could have negative impacts on global food security.",
      "Finally, the ongoing tech war could lead to a decrease in the ability of both countries to effectively govern their agricultural sectors. This could result in a lack of transparency in the production and distribution of food, which could have negative impacts on global food security.

    "question": "4. How do nuclear reactors currently built above ground protect themselves against aircraft crashes and missiles?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "Nuclear reactors currently built above ground protect themselves against aircraft crashes and missiles through a combination of physical and technical safeguards. One of the most significant measures is the use of containment vessels, which are designed to withstand the impact of an aircraft crash or missile strike. These vessels are typically made of reinforced concrete or steel and are designed to contain any potential releases of radioactive materials.",
      "In addition to containment vessels, nuclear reactors also use other physical barriers to protect against potential threats. For example, many reactors are located in remote areas, far away from densely populated areas, which reduces the likelihood of an aircraft crash or missile strike. Additionally, many reactors are surrounded by high fences and other security measures, such as security cameras and motion detectors, to deter potential intruders.",
      "Finally, nuclear reactors also use technical safeguards to protect against aircraft crashes and missiles. For example, many reactors are equipped with radar systems that can detect potential threats and alert operators to take appropriate action. Additionally, some reactors are equipped with air deflection systems, which use fans or other means to divert incoming missiles away from the reactor.",
      "Overall, while there is always a risk of aircraft crashes and missiles targeting nuclear reactors, the physical and technical safeguards in place help to reduce this risk significantly."

    "question": "2. What are some of the gendered implications of climate change, and how do they affect women's vulnerabilities?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "Climate change has significant gendered implications that affect women's vulnerabilities in various ways. One of the most prominent gendered implications of climate change is the disproportionate impact on women's health and well-being. Women are often responsible for gathering water, which is essential for their families, and the depletion of groundwater due to climate change makes this task even more challenging. Moreover, women are more vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change, such as malnutrition, malaria, and waterborne diseases.",
      "Another gendered implication of climate change is the impact on women's livelihoods. Women are often more dependent on natural resources such as forests, which are being degraded by climate change. This makes it difficult for women to access resources for their livelihoods, which can lead to poverty and food insecurity. Additionally, women's roles in agriculture and food production are being threatened by climate change, which can make it difficult for them to meet their families' basic needs.",
      "Finally, climate change has gendered implications for women's rights and agency. Women are often more vulnerable to gender-based violence and discrimination, and climate change can exacerbate these issues. For example, women in areas affected by climate change may face increased pressure to leave their homes in search of resources, which can increase their risk of gender-based violence. Additionally, climate change can limit women's access to decision-making processes and resources, which can further marginalize them in their communities.",
      "Overall, the gendered implications of climate change have significant implications for women's vulnerabilities and must be taken into account in efforts to address climate change."

However, the challenges include the ongoing transmission of the virus, the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable populations, and the potential for the virus to mutate and become more resistant to treatments.",
      "One success of the US in controlling the spread of COVID-19 has been the widespread distribution of vaccines. The government has worked closely with pharmaceutical companies to ensure that vaccines are readily available to those who need them. This has helped to significantly reduce the number of cases and deaths across the country.",
      "Another success has been the effective implementation of contact tracing. The US government has implemented a system where people who have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19 are contacted and advised to quarantine themselves. This has helped to prevent the spread of the virus.",
      "Despite these successes, there are still ongoing challenges in controlling the spread of COVID-19. The virus continues to spread, and new cases are being reported every day. This has led to a renewed push for vaccine distribution and other measures to prevent the spread of the virus. Additionally, COVID-19 has had a significant impact on vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions.",
      "Another challenge is the potential for the virus to mutate and become more resistant to treatments. This could make it more difficult to control the spread of the virus in the future. To address this, the US government has implemented measures to monitor the virus and track any changes in its behavior."

    "question": "3. What is the impact of individual freedom on the US's ability to enforce vaccination and mask-wearing during the pandemic?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "In the United States, the impact of individual freedom on the ability to enforce vaccination and mask-wearing during the pandemic has been a contentious issue. On one hand, the government has the responsibility to protect public health and safety, which includes enforcing measures such as mandatory vaccination and mask-wearing to prevent the spread of the virus. However, individual freedom is also a fundamental right in the United States, and some argue that mandatory measures infringe upon this right.",
      "One argument against mandatory vaccination is that it violates individual rights. The right to make decisions about one's own body and health is a deeply held value in the United States, and some argue that the government should not be able to force individuals to receive a vaccine. Additionally, there are concerns about the safety and effectiveness of certain vaccines, which could further erode public trust in government-mandated vaccination programs.",
      "On the other hand, the government has a responsibility to protect public health and safety during a pandemic. Mandatory vaccination and mask-wearing are just two of the many measures that have been implemented to slow the spread of the virus and prevent serious illness or death. While some argue that these measures infringe upon individual freedom, it is important to remember that public health is a collective effort, and individuals have a responsibility to protect themselves and their communities.",
      "In conclusion, the impact of individual freedom on the US's ability to enforce vaccination and mask-wearing during the pandemic is a complex issue that requires a careful balancing of individual rights and public health concerns. While mandatory measures may be necessary to prevent the spread of the virus, it is important to do so in a way that respects individual freedom and protects the rights of all citizens."

      "Challen ges Follow the science or not : COVID -19 vaccines protect people from getting infected, severely ill, and significantly reduce the death rate.",
      "However, since vaccines are not 100% effective at preventing infection, fully vaccinated people could still get C OVID - 19, but are less likely to develop serious illness than those who are unvaccinated.",
      "Even with the abundance of vaccines in the US, unfortunately, as of now only 176 million people or 53.6% of the population is fully vaccinated.",

      "COMMENTARY WHILE DEVELOPED countries are trying to re -open borders to resume global activities, developing countries are still struggling to control their fatality rates due to unavailability of vaccines.",
      "What are the successes and challenges one co uld learn from the United States, where more than 40 million people have been infected so far, with more than 650,000 deaths? Successes Vaccine development : The US vaccines approved to date either as fully authorised or for emergency use only are Pfizer -BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson.",
      "Both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are based on m -RNA which teaches the immune system to prevent infection from the COVID -19.",
      "The Johnson & Johnson vaccine teaches the immune system to attack the protein that causes the COVID -19 to infect other cells.",
      "Normally, vaccine development takes a long time -- about 10 -15 years.",
      "Pfizer and Moderna were able to use old technology for new applications, by leveraging on the m-RNA research taken a few decades ago to develop the COVID -19 vaccine.",
      "Government support : At the onset of the pandemic, the Trump administration was able to speed up the logistics to design, build and distribute ventilators and personal protection equipment to reduce the death rate of COVID -19 patients.",
      "It also pumped in money to invest and/or to order in advance a number of vaccines being developed such that if and when it worked, vaccines could be produced in a short time and in large quantities for the US.",
      "As Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were approved for emergency use only in January 2021, the Biden administration was successful in delivering the vaccines to the people.",
      "This requires coordinated efforts from the federal government and states to the local authorities to work out the most practical ways to vaccinate people from mass vaccination sites, hospitals, pharmacies and so on.",
      "It was so successful such that by the beginning of summer 2021 the US had one of the highest vaccination rates worldwide only behind Israel and the United Kingdom.",
      "Challen ges Follow the science or not : COVID -19 vaccines protect people from getting infected, severely ill, and significantly reduce the death rate.",
      "However, since vaccines are not 100% effective at preventing infection, fully vaccinated people could still get C OVID - 19, but are less likely to develop serious illness than those who are unvaccinated.",
      "Even with the abundance of vaccines in the US, unfortunately, as of now only 176 million people or 53.6% of the population is fully vaccinated.",
      "It means approximatel y 90 million are eligible but decided not to.",
      "This provides a breeding ground for the virus to potentially mutate to become new variants.",
      "The new variant could be benign or become more contagious and virulent.",
      "The infection and death rates have been incre asing since the middle of June 2021.",
      "This creates problems for patients who need hospitalisation especially the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).",
      "In some states, most of the ICU beds are occupied by the unvaccinated COVID -19 patients thus denying those with other critical diseases.",
      "Freedom and individualism : Whether people agree that public safety should have a higher priority than individual rights or not, in the US, individual freedom has always been one of the country\u2019s key foundations.",
      "It allows activities t hat people in other countries find hard to understand.",
      "For instance in Texas one can carry a handgun without a permit or in New Hampshire one can ride a motorcycle without a helmet where the state official motto is \u201cLive Free or Die\u201d.",
      "Because of this cul ture of freedom, it is very difficult if not possible to mandate, enforce vaccination or mask wearing in public.",
      "The legal system is complex where the local authority can challenge the state and the state can challenge the federal government.",
      "Misinformati on: This is a very serious problem in the US as it creates mistrust.",
      "It is very difficult to control misinformation, especially from politicians, public figures, media networks, who are out to serve their own interests.",
      "There is a lot of totally incorrect information about the disease prevention and treatment of COVID -19, therefore reducing the effectiveness of the pandemic management.",
      "Politics : It is undeniable that US politics play a very critical part in addressing the COVID -19 pandemic, with voters dee ply polarised.",
      "The Democratic Party followers tend to favour mask wearing and vaccination; the Republican Party followers tend to play down the seriousness of the COVID -19.",
      "Incentives : Even with monetary rewards and other incentives, the vaccination rate only achieved a moderate success since those they try to persuade have already been vaccinated.",
      "Learning to Live with COVID -19 Since no single country can solve the pandemic, the Biden administration has restored the US\u2019 relationship with the World Heal th Organisation (WHO) so as to coordinate a global response to the pandemic.",
      "It also contributed US$4 billion to COVAX, the vaccine alliance whose mission is to distribute COVID -19 vaccines to low - and middle - income countries.",
      "By August 2021 the US has s hipped 110 million COVID -19 vaccine doses to 65 countries with no strings attached.",
      "The US has expanded the number of Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\u2019s regional offices to gain first -hand knowledge, including an office in Hanoi in August 2 021 to cover Southeast Asia.",
      "The Biden administration is pushing for future preparedness in dealing with potential pandemic with a $65 billion proposal in September 2021 to accelerate vaccine development, testing, production, and early warning systems.",
      "What Next: Lessons to Be Learned In monitoring what happens in the US, one could draw some lessons: \u2022 old technology could have new applications; \u2022 vaccine distribution is a hands -on operation that involves all parties; \u2022 misinformation creates mistrust which must be controlled to have an effective pandemic management; \u2022 trust is very critical and that is the main reason why the US has so many unvaccinated people; \u2022 achieving global vaccination as quickly as possible is important since the more contagiou s variant could originate from anywhere such as the Delta variant from India and the Gamma variant from Brazil; \u2022 early warning is critical to minimise the virus spreading early.",
      "The flu virus keeps on mutating and it seems that people now have accepted i t as a fact of life to have a flu shot annually.",
      "The WHO estimates that annually one billion people worldwide get the flu and 290,000 to 650,000 die.",
      "Almost certainly, the COVID -19 will not go away.",
      "What are the number of deaths from COVID -19 that people can accept in order to carry on with normal life? Nobody knows and it depends on the risk level that people are willing to accept.",
      "The threshold varies from country to country where it is influenced by factors such as ethnicity, culture, politics, religio n, and background."

    "close_book_answer": [
      "The US has played a critical role in the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The country has provided significant financial and logistical support to international efforts to combat the virus, including providing funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international organizations to purchase medical supplies and equipment. Additionally, the US has contributed a significant amount of personal protective equipment (PPE) to healthcare workers and frontline responders around the world.",
      "One of the most significant contributions made by the US has been in the development of vaccines and treatments. The US government has invested heavily in research and development efforts to create a vaccine, and the country has played a key role in the distribution of vaccines globally. The US has also made significant contributions to the development of treatments for COVID-19, including antiviral drugs and ventilators.",
      "However, the US has also faced criticism for its response to the pandemic. Some have accused the government of prioritizing the interests of the pharmaceutical industry over public health, while others have criticized the government's handling of the pandemic, including the rollout of the vaccine and the lack of resources for frontline responders. Despite these challenges, the US has remained committed to global efforts to combat COVID-19 and has continued to play a critical role in the global response."

    "question": "3. What are the potential consequences of the hawkish policy shift towards China?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "1. The hawkish policy shift towards China could lead to a further deterioration in the US-China relationship, potentially escalating into a full-blown trade war. This could have significant economic consequences, including higher tariffs and disruptions to global supply chains. Additionally, the increased tensions could also lead to a rise in geopolitical tensions, as the two countries compete for influence in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.",
      "2. The hawkish policy shift towards China could also have significant political consequences, particularly in the United States. The Trump administration's hardline stance on China has been widely criticized by both Democrats and Republicans, who argue that it is harming US interests and alienating key allies. If the shift continues, it could weaken support for the administration among the American public and further divide the country along partisan lines.",
      "3. Finally, the hawkish policy shift towards China could have significant implications for the global economy. The US and China are the world's two largest economies, and their relationship has a significant impact on the global trading system. If the two countries were to engage in a full-blown trade war, it could lead to a global recession and cause significant disruptions to international trade and investment flows. As such, policymakers and businesses around the world will be closely watching the US-China relationship in the coming years, and will be looking for ways to mitigate the potential risks and consequences of the hawkish policy shift towards China."

    ],
    "question": "4. What is the argument for a more dovish policy towards China?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The argument for a more dovish policy towards China is rooted in the belief that a more conciliatory approach towards China can lead to a more stable and peaceful relationship between the two countries. This approach involves engaging in dialogue, addressing concerns, and avoiding confrontational actions that could escalate tensions.",
      "One argument in favor of a more dovish policy towards China is that it can help to reduce the risk of conflict and increase the likelihood of cooperation. By engaging in dialogue and avoiding confrontational actions, the risk of misunderstandings and miscalculations can be reduced, leading to a more stable and peaceful relationship. This can be particularly important in the context of sensitive issues such as trade, territorial disputes, and human rights, where a more confrontational approach could exacerbate tensions and increase the risk of conflict.",
      "Another argument in favor of a more dovish policy towards China is that it can help to promote economic cooperation and growth. China is a major trading partner and investor, and a more conciliatory approach can help to promote economic ties and increase opportunities for cooperation. This can be particularly important in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, where cooperation and collaboration can be critical in addressing global challenges.",
      "Finally, a more dovish policy towards China can also help to promote regional stability and security. China's rise as a global power has led to concerns about its intentions and actions in the region. A more conciliatory approach can help to reassure allies and partners that the United States is committed to promoting stability and security in the region, and can help to reduce tensions and promote cooperation.",
      "In conclusion, a more dovish policy towards China can help to reduce the risk of conflict, promote economic cooperation and growth, and promote regional stability and security. While there are challenges and risks associated with a more conciliatory approach, the potential benefits of a more dovish policy towards China make it a compelling argument for policymakers."

      "In the last half century, the US superpower has itself lost large -scale wars against far weaker but more determined adversaries in Vietnam and Afghanistan.",
      "Since Taiwan and the South and East China Seas are ultimately less important to the United States than to China, doves argue that it would be geopolitically prudent for America to cede them to China\u2019s sphere of influence.",
      "Notwithstanding the rhetorical scorn which generations of US policymakers have heaped on the concept, spheres of influence have long served as a critical tool for promoting peace between great power adversaries.",
      "Unfortunately, this option also entails a serious credibility problem for the United States.",
      "This is because granting China a sphere of influence would inevitably spark widespread alarm ab out the reliability of US commitments to the defence of its regional allies.",
      "This strategic concern would be particularly intense for two reasons.",
      "First, among the states that are contesting China\u2019s maritime claims are Japan and the Philippines, which als o happen to be lynchpins of the US alliance network in the region.",
      "Consequently, if the United States permits China to seize the contested territories, this will signal that Washington is also unwilling to oppose Chinese aggression against the Japanese and Philippine home islands.",
      "Second, although the United States is no longer formally allied to Taiwan, the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act commits Washington to provide the island with de fence assistance and to \u201cmaintain the capacity\u2026to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion [against Taiwan].\u201d Also, three of the last four presidents \u2013 Bush, Trump and Biden \u2013 have either declared or strongly insinuated that they would come to Taiwan\u2019s defence if it were to be attacked by the PRC.",
      "Given the intense bipartisan anti-China mood in US politics today, it is almost inconceivable that the Biden administration would abandon Taiwan \u2013 an economically thriving liberal democracy \u2013 to the depredations of the PRC.",
      "Averting the Worst -Case Scenarios The United States can mitigate the credibility problems associated with both the hawkish and dovish strat egies by navigating a middle course between them.",
      "Such a policy would seek to raise the costs of further Chinese expansionism in the South and East China Seas and Taiwan Strait through \u201c soft balancing \u201d, or the coordinated employment of non -military tools of coercive statecraft, including diplomatic ostracism and economic sanctions.",
      "This middle -ground policy would also enable Washington to continue providing Taiw an with robust military assistance.",
      "In recognition of the unfavourable balance of stakes for China, however, the United States would have to scrupulously refrain from direct military intervention against China in these geographic areas.",
      "Importantly, this prohibition means that the United States would not employ its military forces to defend the maritime claims of Japan and the Philippines.",
      "But it could reassure Tokyo and Manila of Washington\u2019s ironclad commitment to the security of their uncontested homela nds, however, by significantly bolstering its military presence in both countries.",
      "Although this approach would not appeal to diehard hawks or d oves, it might avoid the worst -case scenarios associated with their preferred policies.",
      "For hawks, it is that Washington stumbles into yet another exorbitant and inauspicious war of choice on the heels of Iraq and Afghanistan, though this time against a nu clear armed great power.",
      "For doves, it is that conciliatory initiatives aimed at forestalling such a war prompt disaffected US allies to bandwagon with C hina, thereby imperiling the regional balance of power."

      "The credibility problem that afflicts both the hawkish and dovish approaches in the Korean crisis is the tendency for each side to use aggressive rhetoric and military posturing to demonstrate their resolve, leading to a cycle of escalation and mistrust.",
      "This problem is further compounded by the fact that both sides are unwilling to make concessions or compromise, which makes it difficult to reach a resolution.",
      "To mitigate this credibility problem, it is necessary for both sides to demonstrate a commitment to diplomacy and to take concrete steps towards de-escalation, such as reducing tensions through confidence-building measures and engaging in direct negotiations.",
      "This can help to build trust and create an environment in which meaningful progress can be made towards a resolution of the crisis.",

Hawkish and dovish options for dealing with China have been proposed, with hawkish options advocating for increased military deployments and a formal security guarantee to Taiwan, and dovish options advocating for ceding Taiwan and the South and East China Seas to China's sphere of influence.",

Both hawkish and dovish approaches have a credibility problem, with the hawkish option lacking credibility due to the disparity in the importance of the disputes to China and the US, and the dovish option facing concerns about the reliability of US commitments to the defense of its regional allies.",

    "question": "5. What was the approach of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini towards Iran's transformation?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's approach towards Iran's transformation was characterized by a clear vision and a determined strategy. Khomeini, who was a prominent Shia cleric, played a crucial role in Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979, which led to the overthrow of the Western-backed monarchy and the establishment of an Islamic republic.",
      "One of Khomeini's key approaches was to emphasize the importance of Islamic values and principles in governance. He believed that Iran needed to be governed according to Islamic law, or Shariah, and that the rights and duties of citizens should be based on Islamic teachings. This approach was reflected in the new constitution of Iran, which was drafted after the revolution and emphasized the role of Islam in the country's governance.",
      "Khomeini also believed in the importance of popular participation in governance. He believed that the people had a right to be involved in decision-making and that their voices should be heard. This approach was reflected in the establishment of the Islamic Consultative Assembly, or the parliament, which was given significant powers in the new constitution.",
      "Finally, Khomeini believed in the importance of international relations and the need for Iran to play a role in the Islamic world and beyond. He sought to build bridges with other Islamic countries and to promote the idea of an Islamic unity. This approach was reflected in Iran's foreign policy, which emphasized the importance of regional stability and the need for dialogue and cooperation with other countries.",
      "In conclusion, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's approach towards Iran's transformation was characterized by a clear vision and a determined strategy. He emphasized the importance of Islamic values and principles in governance, popular participation in decision-making, and international relations. These approaches were reflected in the new constitution of Iran and the country's foreign policy, and continue to shape Iran's political and social landscape to this day."

    "question": "2. To what extent do President Trump's tweets reflect his administration's policies?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "In recent years, President Trump's tweets have become a prominent part of his communication strategy with the public. While some argue that his tweets reflect his administration's policies, others believe that they are merely a reflection of his personal views and opinions.",
      "One claim is that President Trump's tweets often align with his administration's policies. For instance, when he announced the ban on transgender individuals serving in the military, his tweet reflected the policy change that was later implemented by the Department of Defense. Similarly, his tweets on immigration have been consistent with the policies of his administration, such as the implementation of the travel ban and the increased number of immigration raids.",
      "However, another claim is that President Trump's tweets often go beyond the policies of his administration. Many of his tweets are personal in nature and reflect his personal views, such as his tweets about the Russia investigation or his attacks on the media. These tweets can be seen as a way for him to express his personal frustrations and emotions, rather than representing the official position of his administration.",
      "Furthermore, some argue that President Trump's tweets can actually hinder the implementation of his administration's policies. His tweets can create confusion and uncertainty among the public, as well as among his own cabinet members. For example, when he tweeted about the government shutdown in December 2018, it created confusion among Congress and the public about the direction of negotiations.",
      "In conclusion, while President Trump's tweets can reflect his administration's policies, it is also important to recognize that many of his tweets are personal in nature and do not necessarily represent the official position of his administration. Furthermore, his tweets can also hinder the implementation of his policies by creating confusion and uncertainty among the public and his cabinet members."

One key claim is that it has created a new level of direct communication between the President and the public, which has led to more immediate and accessible information about the administration's activities. This has also made it easier for the President to bypass traditional news outlets and communicate directly with his supporters.",
      "Another claim is that the President's use of Twitter has also made it easier for him to shape the narrative around his administration and its policies.

      "COMMENTARY IN THE past couple of years, discussions on AI ethi cs became the norm, with a variety of actors putting forth over 40 sets of fairly iden tical principles.",
      "These principles include: accountability, controllability, diversity , explainability, fairness, human- centricity, transparency, safety, security, and sus tainability.",
      "While this creates a shared language assisting coun tries in addressing similar concerns, the local interpretation of these princip les can differ widely, often leading to a deep sense of confusion.",
      "With the wide proliferat ion of such AI ethics principles, practitioners are getting closer to agreeing on wha t they should be in theory, but not on how to make them work in practice.",
      "Problem of Effective Implementation Principles like the ones recently published by the OECD are illustrative.",
      "They combine many existing works on AI ethics principles into an other fairly generic guideline.",
      "This level of abstraction makes it appealing enough to c reate an important international consensus.",
      "It is also, however, vague enough to allow local ac tors to interpret the principles as they see fit within their own social and cultural c ontexts.",
      "This diversity of interpretation is essential in ensuring that benefits brought to h umanity by using AI are inclusive.",
      "The problem is, therefore, one of effective impleme ntation.",
      "The problem of effective implementation is the test bed of these principles, which can often be detached from technical capabilities and h uman practices.",
      "Can these AI ethics principles be codified into technical and hu man practices? In theory, yes.",
      "The abovementioned principles benefit us.",
      "They are inte nded to keep us safe and help us all benefit from the use of AI.",
      "In practice, however, they face real-life conflict of interests such as corporate profitability, individual and collective biases and inequality, low general levels of technical literacy, the sanctification of progress, and the desire for constant convenience.",
      "Moving from Principles to Action The good news is that this problem is already being partially solved.",
      "Individuals and institutions working in the AI ethics field are mov ing from principles to action.",

      "The bad news, however, is that while this work cont ributes immensely to the beneficial development and use of AI, it is still only the beg inning.",
      "We need wider geographical participation and action to put AI ethics principle s into practice and create inclusive benefits.",
      "Until we are able to achieve that, any be nefits called for in AI ethics principles run the risk of staying as an idealistic vision for a speculative future.",
      "Coming to Terms with the Present While AI might still look futuristic, its early sta ge applications are already as widespread as they are pervasive.",
      "To most, AI is in visible.",
      "Users cannot really see it or interact with it, and they often do not understa nd how it works or affects them and their actions.",
      "And yet, most regulations and AI eth ics principles look towards the theoretical future and thus fail to address the imp lementation programme.",
      "Due to their soft governance nature, most AI ethics principles do not offer tangible solutions.",
      "More alarmingly, many government regulat ors remains unwilling to offer tangible solutions due to fears that overregulation will \u2018stifle innovation\u2019.",
      "This creates a false dichotomy where ethical and we ll-regulated developments \u2018sacrifice\u2019 speed or innovation to ensure benefit.",
      "In reality, not making this \u2018sacrifice\u2019 leads to development that is prone to structural er rors, stalls in achieving market viability, and mostly just serves its developers.",
      "Additions to the over 40 existing sets of AI ethics principles are a positive and welcome development if they represent new concerns and popu lation groups.",
      "But things will only change when local governments interpret and im plement them in local regulations and more institutions develop technical tools and m ethods to put them into practice.",
      "Tangible solutions are within reach.",
      "The Small Country Advantage Smaller countries have an edge in solving this prob lem.",
      "As importers of technology from larger countries, smaller ones often find them selves relying on tools not developed with their social and technical needs in mind.",
      "This entails an adjustment and adaptation period for users and the technology itself.",
      "All governments must, therefore, invest in creating regulatory and technical sandboxes to ensure the adjustment and adaptation period goes as smoothly as possible and comes to positive conclusions.",
      "But small government s can do it faster and more efficiently.",
      "To that end, they should do two things : The first is to institute agile regulatory mechanis ms that develop with and support the nation\u2019s beneficial use of AI.",
      "The second is to inv est in creating well-informed and resourced actors that put local AI ethics principle s interpretations into practice.",
      "Investment in a competitive future should be about beneficial development, not just a rapid one.",
      "If not, our future will see us spending years trying to identify and fix the mistakes we have made in the name of careless progr ess, and that\u2019s the best case scenario.",

    "close_book_answer": [
      "The war between Russia and Ukraine has had a significant impact on global food security, particularly in Asia. One claim is that the conflict has disrupted global trade routes, which has led to a shortage of certain food products, particularly in Asian countries that rely heavily on imported goods. For example, Ukraine is a major producer of wheat, corn, and other grains, and the disruption of trade routes has led to a decrease in the supply of these products, resulting in higher prices and food scarcity in countries like China and India.",
      "Another claim is that the conflict has also affected the livelihoods of millions of people, particularly in Ukraine, where the war has resulted in displacement, poverty, and malnutrition. This has led to a decrease in food production and increased demand for food assistance in the region, which has further strained global food security.",
      "Finally, the war has also resulted in the destruction of infrastructure and agricultural land, which has had a long-term impact on food production and availability. This has resulted in a decrease in the overall food supply and has had a ripple effect on global food security, particularly in countries that rely heavily on imported food products.",

    "question": "2. What role do fertilisers play in global food production, and how have the recent developments in Russia affected the global trade of fertilisers?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "Fertilisers play a crucial role in global food production by providing essential nutrients to crops, enhancing soil fertility, and promoting plant growth. However, the recent developments in Russia's fertiliser industry have had a significant impact on the global trade of fertilisers.",
      "Firstly, Russia's focus on increasing domestic food production has led to an increase in demand for fertilisers. This has resulted in a surge in local fertiliser production, which has reduced the country's dependence on imported fertilisers. This shift in demand has had a significant impact on the global trade of fertilisers, as Russia is a major player in the global fertiliser market.",
      "Secondly, Russia's increased production of high-quality fertilisers has also affected the global market. The country's fertiliser industry has made significant investments in research and development, resulting in the production of advanced fertilisers with improved efficiency and reduced environmental impact. These high-quality fertilisers have gained popularity in the global market, and many countries have started to adopt them.",
      "Lastly, Russia's political and economic ties with other countries have also affected the global trade of fertilisers. The country's alliances with countries such as China and Iran have resulted in increased trade and investment in the fertiliser industry. This has further strengthened Russia's position in the global fertiliser market, and has had a ripple effect on the global trade of fertilisers.",
      "In conclusion, the recent developments in Russia's fertiliser industry have had a significant impact on the global trade of fertilisers. Russia's increased focus on domestic food production, production of high-quality fertilisers, and political and economic ties with other countries have all played a role in shaping the global fertiliser market."

      "COMMENTARY AMID GROWING tensions between the United States and China, Washington has announced a new South China Sea policy.",
      "The new policy was expressed by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on 13 July 2020 as the two powers locked horns on multiple fronts from economic and technological competition and issues over Hong Kong and Xinjiang, to the confrontation in the South China Se a.",
      "The new policy statement called out Chinese coercive actions against its Southeast Asian neighbours and promised support in protection of their respective maritime rights.",
      "The stronger US stance came after a landmark US -Japan -Australia joint statement of 7 July, condemning Chinese actions in the region.",
      "The trilateral declaration was followed by unilateral statements by Japan, Australia and India, among others, along the same tone.",
      "Why the New US Policy Pompeo\u2019s statement made the intention of the new policy crystal clear: \u201cBeijing\u2019s claims to offshore resources across most of the South China Sea are completely unlawful, as is its campaign of bullying to control them\u201d.",
      "The policy aligned the US South China Sea position closely with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the 2016 Philippines versus China international arbitration ruling, which delegitimised claims to historic rights and China\u2019s so-called nine -dashed line in the South China Sea as the basis of Beijing\u2019s claims.",
      "The statement therefore also showed Washington\u2019s strong support for the declaration made by ASEAN leaders at the end of the 36th ASEAN Summit on 26 June 2020, insisting that all maritime claims to be based on international law, and especially the UNCLOS.",
      "Not all this is new, though.",
      "Washington has consistently denounced Chinese excessive and illegal maritime claims in South China Sea, including the nine -dashed line, and has increasingly called out Chinese bullying of other South China Sea claimant states.",
      "More Explicit Tone What is different, however, is the explicit tone and message it sends to Beijing as well as allies and partners in the region that the US is doubling down on stopping China\u2019s coercive actions in the South China Sea.",
      "As a clear signal t o allies and partners, the statement singles out Chinese assertive actions in the Philippines\u2019 Scarborough Shoal, Mischief Reef, and the Second Thomas Shoal, Vietnam\u2019s Vanguard Bank, Malaysia\u2019s Luconia Shoals, and Natuna Basar off Indonesia.",
      "It calls out China\u2019s harassment of coastal states\u2019 legitimate fishing and hydrocarbon development activities around those maritime features.",
      "The policy thus gives explicit US support to those states and the exercise of their rights within their respective maritime zone s, receiving positive acknowledgments from the region.",
      "In addition, the support for claimants to exercise their legal rights in their respective exclusive economic zones gives Washington a new tone to its actions in the South China Sea, one that has more credibility than backing all US moves under the assertion to uphold the freedom of navigation in the region.",
      "The two need to go hand in hand.",
      "China\u2019s Response & What Lies Ahead China, unsurprisingly, was unhappy about the US statement and followed up with the rather usual tirade.",
      "Beijing lashed Washington on interfering in the region\u2019s issues and on unnecessarily escalating the situation.",
      "Beijing views the new statement as a significant shift in Washington\u2019s policy toward South China Sea, abandoning the s tated neutrality on sovereignty disputes.",
      "Instead, China sees the new US policy as a direct challenge to its own position and blames Washington on putting a wedge between itself and Southeast Asian claimant states.",
      "With the South China Sea policy statemen t, US created itself a more explicit policy framework for activities that would deter what Pompeo accused as attempts to create a Chinese \u201cmaritime empire\u201d in the South China Sea and support the smaller Southeast Asian coastal states\u2019 rights and freedoms i n their respective exclusive economic zones (EEZs).",
      "For the US, however, the real challenge still lies ahead.",
      "How Washington go on to implement the strongly -worded policy matters ultimately more than the statement itself.",

      "An example of possible US actions that will follow took place from late April till early May when Chinese Haiyang Dizhi 8 oil exploration vessel, flanked by Chinese maritime militi a and coast guard boats, intruded into Malaysia\u2019s EEZ.",
      "Ostensibly to survey the area, the Chinese vessels harassed the Petronas -operated West Capella rig\u2019s drilling operations, inviting a close monitoring by nearby US Navy warships.",
      "Following this brief s tandoff, the US Navy\u2019s littoral combat ships intermittently made themselves seen by Chinese surveillance vessels.",
      "The Navy has thus made its presence seen and felt for all sides.",
      "Whether these examples have provided a precedence for the future US Navy miss ions and involvement in disputes remains to be seen.",
      "Legitimacy and Credibility It goes without saying that while stronger US support for weaker states\u2019 maritime rights is welcomed, it also raises tension in the region.",
      "With the stronger, more muscular US Navy presence comes more frequent encounters with Chinese counterparts and, therefore, grown risk of accidents and escalation.",
      "Washington must therefore ensure that its actions, while deliberate, are both credible, controlled and legitimate, and avoid ent angling smaller states between the two behemoths navies.",
      "Ideally, US presence comes in frequent coordination with allies and partners, giving any action it takes broader legitimacy.",
      "Ultimately, legitimacy is the most critical enabler for any US action in the South China Sea and how those actions will be received and perceived by others.",
      "It is, nevertheless, a good start that the US is voicing support for the 36th ASEAN Summit chairman\u2019s statement and backing allies and partners  \u0336 such as Japan, Australi a, India  \u0336 in unilateral as well as joint statements that call out Chinese coercive actions.",
      "It is also helpful that Washington is insisting on the primacy of international rules and norms over \u201cmight makes right\u201d.",

      "COMMENTARY AMID GROWING tensions between the United States and China, Washington has announced a new South China Sea policy.",
      "The new policy was expressed by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on 13 July 2020 as the two powers locked horns on multiple fronts from economic and technological competition and issues over Hong Kong and Xinjiang, to the confrontation in the South China Se a.",
      "The new policy statement called out Chinese coercive actions against its Southeast Asian neighbours and promised support in protection of their respective maritime rights.",
      "The stronger US stance came after a landmark US -Japan -Australia joint statement of 7 July, condemning Chinese actions in the region.",
      "The trilateral declaration was followed by unilateral statements by Japan, Australia and India, among others, along the same tone.",
      "Why the New US Policy Pompeo\u2019s statement made the intention of the new policy crystal clear: \u201cBeijing\u2019s claims to offshore resources across most of the South China Sea are completely unlawful, as is its campaign of bullying to control them\u201d.",
      "The policy aligned the US South China Sea position closely with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the 2016 Philippines versus China international arbitration ruling, which delegitimised claims to historic rights and China\u2019s so-called nine -dashed line in the South China Sea as the basis of Beijing\u2019s claims.",
      "The statement therefore also showed Washington\u2019s strong support for the declaration made by ASEAN leaders at the end of the 36th ASEAN Summit on 26 June 2020, insisting that all maritime claims to be based on international law, and especially the UNCLOS.",
      "Not all this is new, though.",
      "Washington has consistently denounced Chinese excessive and illegal maritime claims in South China Sea, including the nine -dashed line, and has increasingly called out Chinese bullying of other South China Sea claimant states.",
      "More Explicit Tone What is different, however, is the explicit tone and message it sends to Beijing as well as allies and partners in the region that the US is doubling down on stopping China\u2019s coercive actions in the South China Sea.",
      "As a clear signal t o allies and partners, the statement singles out Chinese assertive actions in the Philippines\u2019 Scarborough Shoal, Mischief Reef, and the Second Thomas Shoal, Vietnam\u2019s Vanguard Bank, Malaysia\u2019s Luconia Shoals, and Natuna Basar off Indonesia.",
      "It calls out China\u2019s harassment of coastal states\u2019 legitimate fishing and hydrocarbon development activities around those maritime features.",
      "The policy thus gives explicit US support to those states and the exercise of their rights within their respective maritime zone s, receiving positive acknowledgments from the region.",
      "In addition, the support for claimants to exercise their legal rights in their respective exclusive economic zones gives Washington a new tone to its actions in the South China Sea, one that has more credibility than backing all US moves under the assertion to uphold the freedom of navigation in the region.",
      "The two need to go hand in hand.",
      "China\u2019s Response & What Lies Ahead China, unsurprisingly, was unhappy about the US statement and followed up with the rather usual tirade.",
      "Beijing lashed Washington on interfering in the region\u2019s issues and on unnecessarily escalating the situation.",
      "Beijing views the new statement as a significant shift in Washington\u2019s policy toward South China Sea, abandoning the s tated neutrality on sovereignty disputes.",
      "Instead, China sees the new US policy as a direct challenge to its own position and blames Washington on putting a wedge between itself and Southeast Asian claimant states.",
      "With the South China Sea policy statemen t, US created itself a more explicit policy framework for activities that would deter what Pompeo accused as attempts to create a Chinese \u201cmaritime empire\u201d in the South China Sea and support the smaller Southeast Asian coastal states\u2019 rights and freedoms i n their respective exclusive economic zones (EEZs).",
      "For the US, however, the real challenge still lies ahead.",
      "How Washington go on to implement the strongly -worded policy matters ultimately more than the statement itself.",
      "In a keynote speech to the tenth annual CSIS South China Sea conference, on 14 July 2020, the US Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs David Stilwell said that \u201call tools are on the table\u201d and hinted that there certainly was room to sanction Chine se officials and state -owned enterprises that engage in illegal activities.",
      "An example of possible US actions that will follow took place from late April till early May when Chinese Haiyang Dizhi 8 oil exploration vessel, flanked by Chinese maritime militi a and coast guard boats, intruded into Malaysia\u2019s EEZ.",
      "Ostensibly to survey the area, the Chinese vessels harassed the Petronas -operated West Capella rig\u2019s drilling operations, inviting a close monitoring by nearby US Navy warships.",
      "Following this brief s tandoff, the US Navy\u2019s littoral combat ships intermittently made themselves seen by Chinese surveillance vessels.",
      "The Navy has thus made its presence seen and felt for all sides.",
      "Whether these examples have provided a precedence for the future US Navy miss ions and involvement in disputes remains to be seen.",
      "Legitimacy and Credibility It goes without saying that while stronger US support for weaker states\u2019 maritime rights is welcomed, it also raises tension in the region.",
      "With the stronger, more muscular US Navy presence comes more frequent encounters with Chinese counterparts and, therefore, grown risk of accidents and escalation.",
      "Washington must therefore ensure that its actions, while deliberate, are both credible, controlled and legitimate, and avoid ent angling smaller states between the two behemoths navies.",
      "Ideally, US presence comes in frequent coordination with allies and partners, giving any action it takes broader legitimacy.",

    ],
    "question": "4. What is the difference between the new US policy and previous US stances on the South China Sea?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The new US policy on the South China Sea represents a significant departure from previous US stances on the region. While previous US administrations had generally adopted a policy of diplomatic engagement with China, the new US policy is characterized by a more confrontational approach.",
      "One key difference is the US's increased emphasis on military presence in the region. The new US policy involves a more assertive military posture, with the US military conducting more frequent and extensive freedom of navigation operations (FONOPs) in the South China Sea. This is in contrast to previous US administrations, which had generally avoided direct military challenges to China's territorial claims in the region.",
      "Another key difference is the US's increased focus on the economic dimension of the South China Sea issue. While previous US stances had generally downplayed the economic dimension of the issue, the new US policy places greater emphasis on the economic implications of China's territorial claims in the region. This includes a focus on promoting regional economic integration and countering China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in the region.",
      "Finally, the new US policy also represents a more confrontational approach to China's domestic political system. While previous US administrations had generally avoided criticizing China's domestic political system, the new US policy takes a more critical stance towards China's human rights record and political system. This includes a focus on promoting democracy and human rights in China, and a more vocal criticism of China's treatment of ethnic minorities and other marginalized groups.",
      "Overall, the new US policy on the South China Sea represents a significant departure from previous US stances on the region, with a more confrontational approach towards China's territorial claims, economic initiatives, and domestic political system."
