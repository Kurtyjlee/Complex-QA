    "context": "Commentary WHILE GLOBALISATION fatigue seems to set in, protec tionism is emerging. The question that needs to be asked is what is the tren d underlying this phenomenon and how Asia should respond to it. Since the World War II, free trade has been the cor nerstone of the world economy. The establishment of the World Trade Orga nisation (WTO) in 1995 as well as numerous economic partnership and free trade agr eements have promoted free trade based on the concept of comparative advantage . Institutionalisation of trade and advancement of information technology brought the w orld ever closer together. \u2018New Engine\u2019 Getting Old? On the other hand, the postwar period required a ne w engine for the world economy to rebuild the nations devastated by the war. Meanw hile, Germany and Japan have revived their manufacturing industries running trad e surplus against the United States, which they invested in US treasury securities. The US was a major crude oil exporter until the 197 0s. When oil production declined, the US became increasingly dependent on oil from th e Middle East. In turn, the oil producing countries invested their trade surplus in the US treasury securities over the coming decades. Awash with the US dollar, the Bretton Woods system became unsustainable by 1973 and led to the twin deficit during the Reagan admin istration during the 1980s. Still, the growth of financial markets backed by the US dollar continued to support the expanding international trade and world economy in the 1990s and 2000s. US Turns to Protectionism The recycling of the US dollar has run its course w hile major central banks have taken a series of monetary easing policies in response to the global financial crisis in 2008. The resulting low-interest rate environment and sur ging oil price encouraged investment into the oil industry, leading to the US shale revolution in 2011 and pushing its oil production above 1970 level. The rise in the US oil production could contribute to reduction not only in trade deficit but also in the US treasury issuance, thus affectin g the world. The US can now become self-sufficient in energy, reduce its debt i ssuance, and revive its manufacturing industry. In other words, the US needs less free trade and mo re protectionism. However, free trade remains crucial for other countries, especial ly those which mainly export or import oil. This contradiction of benefits resulted in growing tension between policies of the US and its major trading partners. However, it is not necessarily a bad thing. The US government debt burdens future generations and the reduction of it is a national m andate. On the other hand, major foreign US treasury securities holders such as Chin a and Japan can reduce holdings of these assets that sometimes even incur negative returns in their own currency terms. The rest of the world can also become less a ffected by the US monetary policies. Challenges to the World These changes will create new challenges. First, the rise of the US interest rate means repat riation of the dollar circulating in the world, leading to lower liquidity. Hence, the world needs to reduce its dependency on the dollar in trade and finance. Secondly, global s upply chains need to adjust to the new US economy, which tries to revitalise manufactu ring industries. Third, most countries will see their export to the US decline as the US enters trade wars. These new challenges urge the world to adjust to a new form of international trade and to a multi-currency regime. New wisdom and commitments are required to navigate the world economy to a new direction, which is difficult as we are bound by co nventional wisdom. The hollowing out of the manufacturing industries in the US has m ade its society more vulnerable and allowed for racist sentiments to revive. The feelings of despair in the Rust Belt were not s hared by the elites in the East Coast, who have promoted globalisation. Donald Trump liste ned to the people who felt left out. Contrary to being erratic or a racist, he may actually be gearing the US towards the new world. How Should Asia Response? Asia needs to adjust to the protectionism of the US by introducing appropriate and effective counter measures. More fundamentally, Asi a must 1) rebuild international trade via promotion of regional integration and 2) reduce dependency on the dollar. To promote regional integration, countries need to harmonise regulations and standards in trading, banking, and accounting to cr eate larger markets. Free trade agreements such as Comprehensive and Progressive Ag reement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) should be advanced for Asia to remain compet itive in global value chains and to replace the US to become the global consumer mar ket. To reduce the dollar dependency, a multi-currency c learing system must be introduced for energy trade, in particular, for crude oil and liquefied natural gas as currency and energy are the lifeblood of the economy. To strengt hen the liquidity and effectiveness of the multi-currency regime, off-shore markets bas ed on the Japanese yen and the Chinese yuan should be further developed. Stock exchanges in the region should also be deregu lated so that foreign companies can raise capital by tapping into excessive savings that corporate and household sectors have accumulated. While the US military cuts back involvement in the Middle East and potentially in Asia, each region, in particular, the US allies, need to take up more responsibilities to establish a new security framework not relying sole ly on the US. When the US chooses to be \u201cexcluded,\u201d the rest of the world should show leadership to create a new \u201cinclusive\u201d world order. ",
    "question": "1. What is the underlying trend of protectionism emerging globally and how is it affecting the world economy?",
    "answer": "1. The trend of protectionism that is emerging globally refers to the increasing use of trade barriers by countries to protect their domestic industries and markets from foreign competition. This trend is being driven by a combination of factors, including the rise of populist political movements, concerns over job losses, and a desire to protect national security.\n2. The effects of protectionism on the world economy are complex and multifaceted. On the one hand, it can lead to increased economic growth and job creation in the short term, as domestic industries are shielded from foreign competition. However, in the long term, it can lead to reduced economic efficiency, higher prices for consumers, and a decrease in global trade.\n3. Additionally, protectionism can lead to retaliation from other countries, which can result in a trade war that can have devastating effects on the global economy. This is particularly concerning given the interconnectedness of modern economies, where a downturn in one country can have ripple effects on others. Therefore, it is crucial for countries to carefully consider the impact of protectionism on the global economy before implementing such measures.",

      "The trend towards protectionism is a response to the need for a new economic engine to replace the one that emerged in the post-World War II period. Germany and Japan's revival of their manufacturing industries, resulting in trade surpluses against the US, highlights the need for a new engine for the world economy. The US's increasing dependence on oil from the Middle East, and the resulting investment of oil-producing countries' trade surplus in US treasury securities, also played a role in the rise of protectionism.",
      "Claim 2: The US's potential for self-sufficiency in energy and manufacturing industries is driving the shift towards protectionism.",
      "With the US's potential for self-sufficiency in energy and the revival of its manufacturing industry, there is less need for free trade and more room for protectionism. This shift has resulted in growing tension between US policies and its major trading partners. However, this does not necessarily mean that protectionism is the best solution for the US or the world economy.",
      "Claim 3: Asia should adjust to US protectionism by promoting regional integration and a multi-currency regime.",
      "Asia, particularly, should adjust to US protectionism by introducing counter measures and promoting regional integration through free trade agreements and harmonized regulations. The introduction of a multi-currency system for energy trade and the development of off-shore markets based on the Japanese yen and Chinese yuan can also help reduce dependency on the US dollar. Additionally, deregulation of stock exchanges in the region can help foreign companies raise capital. These measures can help mitigate the potential negative effects of US protectionism on the world economy."
