    "question": "2. What is the historical background of free trade in the world economy?",
    "answer": [
      "The concept of free trade has a long history in the world economy. The idea of free trade is based on the principle of removing barriers to trade, such as tariffs and quotas, and allowing goods and services to flow freely across borders. The earliest known example of free trade is believed to be the ancient trade routes that existed between Mesopotamia and Egypt around 2000 BC.",
      "During the medieval period, trade was largely conducted through guilds, which were organizations of merchants and artisans who controlled the production and distribution of goods and services within a particular trade. This system of trade was characterized by high tariffs and other barriers to trade, which made it difficult for outsiders to participate in the trade.",
      "The modern era of free trade began in the late 19th century with the formation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947. This organization was designed to promote free trade by reducing tariffs and other barriers to trade. The GATT was later replaced by the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995, which has continued to promote free trade as a means of promoting economic growth and development.",
      "Overall, the history of free trade in the world economy has been characterized by a gradual movement towards greater openness and liberalization of trade. While there have been setbacks and challenges along the way, the general trend has been towards greater freedom of trade and the removal of barriers to trade."

    "answer": [
      "The US shift towards protectionism has had a significant impact on other countries. One of the most notable impacts is the rise in trade tensions and conflicts between the US and its trading partners. The US has implemented tariffs on imports from countries such as China, Mexico, and Canada, which has led to retaliatory measures from these countries. This has resulted in a decline in global trade and has had a negative impact on the economies of other countries.",
      "Another impact of the US shift towards protectionism is the loss of competitiveness for US companies in the global market. By implementing tariffs and other protectionist measures, the US is making it more difficult for its companies to compete with foreign companies in the global market. This has led to a decline in US exports and has had a negative impact on the US economy.",
      "Finally, the US shift towards protectionism has also had a negative impact on the US's reputation as a reliable trading partner. By imposing tariffs and other protectionist measures, the US is seen as being less committed to free trade and more interested in protecting its domestic industries. This has led to a decline in trust and confidence in the US as a trading partner, which has had a negative impact on its ability to negotiate favorable trade deals in the future."

FTAs can reduce tariffs and other barriers to trade, making it easier for businesses to operate across borders. This can lead to increased trade and investment, as well as the creation of new jobs and economic growth.",

    "question": "1. What is the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multisectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) and what is its significance in the Indo-Pacific region?",
    "answer": [
      "The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multisectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) is a regional intergovernmental organization established in 1997, with the headquarters in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It is comprised of seven member states, which are Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Myanmar. The primary objective of BIMSTEC is to promote economic, technical, and cultural cooperation among its member states, with a focus on the development of the region.",
      "The significance of BIMSTEC in the Indo-Pacific region lies in its potential to promote regional integration, trade, and investment. The organization has a significant role in fostering economic cooperation and regional connectivity, which can help in promoting sustainable economic growth and development in the region. BIMSTEC can also serve as a platform for member states to collaborate on regional and global issues, such as climate change, disaster management, and terrorism.",
      "Moreover, BIMSTEC can play a crucial role in promoting the interests of the smaller and less developed countries in the region, which can help in reducing their dependence on larger economies and enhancing their economic resilience. The organization can also contribute to the promotion of cultural exchange and people-to-people contacts among its member states, which can help in fostering a sense of regional identity and belonging.",
      "In conclusion, BIMSTEC is a significant regional organization in the Indo-Pacific region, as it has the potential to promote economic cooperation, regional integration, and connectivity, as well as contribute to the promotion of the interests of smaller and less developed countries in the region."

    "question": "3. What impact has the introduction of QE and low interest rates had on financial markets?",
    "answer": [
      "The introduction of Quantitative Easing (QE) and low interest rates has had a significant impact on financial markets. Here are three key claims supported by evidence:",
      "1. QE has increased liquidity in financial markets: QE has increased the money supply, which has led to increased liquidity in financial markets. This has made it easier for investors to trade and has also increased the demand for assets, leading to rising prices. For example, in the United States, the Federal Reserve's QE program led to a significant increase in the stock market and a surge in bond prices.",
      "2. Low interest rates have encouraged risk-taking: Low interest rates have encouraged investors to take on more risk in search of higher returns. This has led to an increase in speculative activity and has also made it easier for governments and corporations to borrow at low rates. However, this has also increased the risk of financial instability, as low interest rates can mask the true cost of borrowing and may encourage excessive risk-taking.",
      "3. QE and low interest rates have created asset price bubbles: The use of QE and low interest rates has led to the creation of asset price bubbles in some markets. For example, in the United States, there have been concerns that the housing market may be in a bubble due to low interest rates and government policies that have encouraged homeownership. Similarly, in some emerging markets, there have been concerns that asset prices, such as stocks and real estate, may be overvalued due to easy monetary policies.",
      "Overall, the impact of QE and low interest rates on financial markets has been mixed. While they have increased liquidity and encouraged risk-taking, they have also created the potential for asset price bubbles and increased the risk of financial instability."

    "answer": [
      "The surge in foreign buying of emerging-market bonds has both positive and negative effects. On the positive side, it can help to reduce risk premiums and lower borrowing costs for emerging-market governments, making it easier for them to borrow and invest in their economies. This, in turn, can stimulate economic growth and create jobs. Additionally, foreign investment can also bring in new capital and expertise, which can help to improve the quality of government bonds and make them more attractive to investors.",
      "However, there are also negative effects to consider. The increased demand for emerging-market bonds can put upward pressure on bond prices, which can lead to higher inflation rates and currency depreciation. This can make it more difficult for emerging-market economies to service their debt, and it can also increase the risk of default. Furthermore, the influx of foreign capital can also lead to a loss of control over the country's economic policies, as foreign investors may have different priorities and agendas than the government.",
      "In conclusion, the surge in foreign buying of emerging-market bonds can have both positive and negative effects, and it is important to carefully consider the potential risks and benefits before making any investment decisions."

      "COMMENTARY THE ASEAN special summit in Jakarta on 24 April 2021 has concluded with a five - point consensus on the Myanmar crisis.",
      "It called for cessation of violence, commencement of political dialogue, a constructive role for ASEAN including an opening for an ASEAN delegation, and the allowance of humanitarian assistance.",
      "At first glance, analysis of the Chair\u2019s statement showed signs of division \u2013 for instance, a lack of consensus on the release of poli tical prisoners, a necessary precondition for dialogue to begin.",
      "Activists criticised that the statement did not go far enough, appearing to show that the summit achieved little.",
      "Yet if politics is, to quote the German statesman Otto von Bismarck, about th e \u2018art of the possible\u2019, then it is necessary to set the outcome against a context of impossibilities, dead ends or worse, into which ASEAN did not throw itself.",
      "Difficulties with Intervention Disappointment with the summit may be seen in the context of calls for external intervention in Myanmar.",
      "This desire to remove the Tatmadaw should be tempered by the reality that this would be costly, risky, and no guarantee of a solution.",
      "Nevertheless, criticisms have continued about the failure to take a harder l ine against the junta, either through the UN or ASEAN, with neither path opening after the summit.",
      "The UN Security Council is deadlocked, where China and Russia would likely block moves by Western powers.",
      "While some therefore conclude that the UN system i s broken, one should think about the scenario where a liberal intervention proceeded without other states\u2019 consent: Myanmar could well become the first proxy battleground in a new front of an emerging \u201cCold War 2.0\u201d, with the conflict sharpening and poss ibly accelerating US -China confrontation.",
      "Mainland Southeast Asian states are not unreasonable to baulk at suggestions in this direction, given their experiences during the Cold War.",
      "At the regional level, ASEAN\u2019s options are tempered by the political div ersity of its membership and its own historical experiences.",
      "When Western powers intervened in post-colonial times, they never did so purely for the sake of democratic values, but always when there was a convergence of material interests to do so, with a b arely - concealed desire to secure those interests in -country for themselves.",
      "Iraq, Libya, Syria, and others provide a litany of examples of long, costly, and complex crises, with the West\u2019s own role itself intrinsically linked to the continuation of those c onflicts.",
      "In each case, domestic divisions interwove with foreign interests to amplify the conflicts.",
      "Roll back further in time and one finds the price of intervention was to have to accept brutal military leaders for whom loyalty to their patron was the primary factor for their grip on power.",
      "Post -colonial states in Southeast Asia rightfully reject this option.",
      "One thing ASEAN has done well is ensure that cultural and ideological diversity among its members did not lead to conflict.",
      "Breaking that formul a in order to \u201cfix\u201d Myanmar risks opening Pandora\u2019s Box for ASEAN member states, and this dismal conclusion unites them notwithstanding sometimes diametrically opposed political systems.",
      "Summit\u2019s High Points Within these constraints, therefore, ASEAN has little room for manoeuvre.",
      "Yet it managed to accomplish several key things at the summit.",
      "First, Tatmadaw Senior General Min Aung Hlaing attended, which was uncertain even days before the summit.",
      "He chose to talk to ASEAN and virtually no one else, prov iding a necessary opening from which a solution must be found.",
      "Under the gaze of ASEAN leaders, he could not decline ASEAN\u2019s offer, something which he would have de facto accomplished by simply failing to show up.",
      "Second, he met UN Special Envoy on Myanm ar Christine Schraner Burgener on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit.",
      "While what transpired has been kept under wraps, the mere fact of meeting would have been impossible without his arrival in Jakarta.",
      "Third, on ASEAN\u2019s part, it presented one of the most public and interventionist outcome statements the regional grouping has ever delivered to another member state.",
      "This represented a big step beyond ASEAN\u2019s usual practices and demonstrated their view of its potential impact on regional security and the impo rtance they have placed on resolution to the crisis.",
      "Next Steps While critics lambasted the lack of details, this is overstated.",
      "There are few details because ASEAN is in uncharted waters, never having done such action before \u2013 itself a sign of how far ASEAN went to secure this outcome.",
      "ASEAN does not commit to things it does not believe it can do.",
      "Implementation details will be hammered out in ASEAN capitals and the ASEAN Secretariat soon.",
      "However, this is just the start of a long process.",
      "While the ou tcome was a big step for ASEAN, the path out of crisis for Myanmar will be a much longer journey.",
      "ASEAN has led the figurative horse to water, but it cannot make it drink.",
      "During Myanmar\u2019s short -lived democracy, the National League for Democracy (NLD), fai led to resolve federal questions about the country and the Tatmadaw did not learn the soft skills it needed to become a guardian of the country\u2019s future.",
      "The Committee Representing the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw has taken first steps to build a more inclusive fr amework and draw in allies through the new National Unity Government (NUG).",
      "While the NUG has the soft power, it is the Tatmadaw with the hard power.",
      "Both are necessary elements for governance in Myanmar, and only when the parties are willing to begin di alogue will a sustainable solution to the Myanmar crisis become possible."

      "Second, he met UN Special Envoy on Myanm ar Christine Schraner Burgener on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit.",

      "Implementation details will be hammered out in ASEAN capitals and the ASEAN Secretariat soon.",
      "However, this is just the start of a long process.",
      "While the ou tcome was a big step for ASEAN, the path out of crisis for Myanmar will be a much longer journey.",
      "ASEAN has led the figurative horse to water, but it cannot make it drink.",
      "During Myanmar\u2019s short -lived democracy, the National League for Democracy (NLD), fai led to resolve federal questions about the country and the Tatmadaw did not learn the soft skills it needed to become a guardian of the country\u2019s future.",
      "The Committee Representing the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw has taken first steps to build a more inclusive fr amework and draw in allies through the new National Unity Government (NUG).",
      "While the NUG has the soft power, it is the Tatmadaw with the hard power.",

      "This can lead to a more stable and prosperous society, with increased opportunities for economic growth and social development.",
      "On the other hand, intervention can also have negative consequences, such as exacerbating tensions and conflicts within the country, or even leading to a further deterioration of the situation.",
      "For example, the imposition of sanctions or other forms of pressure can lead to economic hardship and political instability, and may even contribute to the rise of extremist groups.",

Describing the Ameri can people as \u201cmostly honest, decent and sincere\u201d and \u201cwho want to live in peace and friendship with us, something we are aware of and appreciate, and we will rely on them in the future,\u201d Putin criticised US domestic and foreign policy, placing the blame o n the US ruling class.",
      "He said that Russia would work with the US but only in areas it is interested in, and on terms beneficial to Russia.",
      "Seeking to project an image of reasonableness and signal that Russia is still willing to continue a dialogue, Puti n proposed having a \"live, online\" conversation with the US president.",
      "Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, subsequently explained to reporters that the proposal implied open dialogue and not debate, noting that Biden\u2019s remarks \u201care quite unprecedented, so in order not to let these statements harm bilateral Russian - American relations, which are already in a deplorable state, President Putin suggested discussing the situation but doing so openly\u201d.",
      "Other Russian officials however took a stronger line.",
      "The Fo reign Ministry in Moscow recalled the Russian ambassador in Washington DC for consultations.",
      "Vyacheslav Volodin, Speaker of the Duma, described Biden's comments as \"unacceptable,\" adding that \"they offend the citizens of Russia\u201d.",
      "Federation Council (Upper House) Deputy Speaker Konstantin Kosachev, also described Biden\u2019s remark as \u201cunacceptable,\u201d warning that they \u201cinevitably lead to a sharp exacerbation of our bilateral ties\u201d.",
      "The US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on 22 March that the US wa s anticipating \"tough days\" in relations with Russia.",
      "In reaction, Secretary of the Russian Security Council Nikolai Patrushev stressed that the US would be responsible for that.",
      "Reflecting Russia\u2019s wish not to worsen the relationship, Patrushev stressed that Russia was \u201ccommitted to constructive cooperation\u201d, adding that \u201cwe haven\u2019t taken any hostile steps against the United States, we are not taking any now, nor are we planning to take any in the future\".",

      "She was quoted as say ing on 18 March that there was \u201ca long list of failed \u2013 in some cases, and successful in other cases \u2013 assassinations carried out against critical, independent figures in Russia, including politicians and journalists\u201d.",

      "According to a European Council press statement of 22 March, European Council president, Charles Michel, said that EU relations with Russia are at a \u201clow point\u201d.",

      "The US\u2019 continued opposition to the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project (the 1,230 km pipeline that will double Russian gas exports to the EU) and Germany\u2019s continue d commitment to it, however, will hang like a sword of Damocles over Russo -US as well as US -German relations.",

      "Nevertheless, the \u201charder\u201d approach of top legislators Volodin and Kosachev signals that as a great power, Russia cannot simply react with sangfroid at Biden\u2019s remark.",
      "Seeking not to burn Moscow's bridges with the EU, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, during a visit to China on 23 March, pointed out that Russia was ready to build its relations with the EU should it eliminate an \u201canomaly in contacts\u201d (i.e., its unilateral decisions to impose sanctions).",
      "He noted that there were \u201conly a few European partner countries that have a desire to act based on their national interests\u201d.",
      "(He must have had in mind Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, and France; they account for over half of trade between Russia and the EU, Russia\u2019s leading partner).",
      "Delinking from Western -controlled SWIFT? Lavrov sai d that Russia seeks to work with China to reduce the impact of any further sanctions.",
      "In that regard, Lavrov proposed the reduction of his country\u2019s \u201cexposure to sanctions by strengthening our technological independence and switching to settlements in nati onal and international currencies other than the dollar\u201d as well as moving \u201caway from using Western -controlled international payment systems\u201d.",
      "Lavrov\u2019s statement is not new; in 2018, the then deputy prime minister Arkady Dvorkovich stated that Russian fin ancial institutions and firms were ready to work without SWIFT\u2019s services.",
      "As early as 2015, the then prime minister Dmitry Medvedev called attention to perceived Western countries\u2019 threats to restrict Russia\u2019s operations through SWIFT, warning that Russia \u2019s reaction to such a move \u201cwill be without limits\u201d.",

    "question": "3. Why has there been limited activism in the military arena in response to China's transgressions?",
    "answer": [
      "In recent years, China's increasing aggression in the South China Sea has raised concerns among neighboring countries, including the Philippines. However, despite the potential for military action, there has been limited activism in response to China's transgressions. One reason for this is that the Philippines has limited military capabilities compared to China. China has a large and modern military force, including advanced aircraft carriers and submarines, while the Philippines has a smaller and less advanced military force. Additionally, the Philippines has a long history of conflict with China, dating back to the 1970s, and has been hesitant to engage in military action due to the potential for significant casualties.",
      "Another reason for the limited activism in the military arena is that the Philippines has pursued diplomatic solutions to address China's transgressions. The Philippines has sought support from the international community, including the United States, and has engaged in negotiations with China to resolve disputes peacefully. This approach has been criticized by some as being too soft, but it has allowed the Philippines to maintain diplomatic relations with China and avoid further escalation of tensions.",
      "Finally, the Philippine government has faced significant domestic challenges, including poverty, corruption, and political instability, which have limited its ability to focus on military action. The government has prioritized economic development and social welfare over military expansion, and has sought to maintain good relations with China to avoid jeopardizing economic ties.",
      "In conclusion, the limited activism in the military arena in response to China's transgressions in the South China Sea is due to a combination of factors, including the Philippines' limited military capabilities, the pursuit of diplomatic solutions, and domestic challenges. While military action may be necessary in some cases, it is important to consider the potential consequences and pursue diplomatic solutions whenever possible."

    "question": "4. How has China managed to prevent a hard-balancing coalition from emerging?",
    "answer": [
      "The question of how China has managed to prevent a hard-balancing coalition from emerging is a crucial one, as it speaks to the ability of great powers to cooperate or compete in a complex global environment. In this case, China has managed to prevent a hard-balancing coalition from emerging through a combination of strategies, including economic engagement, diplomatic outreach, and the use of strategic communication.",
      "Firstly, China has used economic engagement to prevent other countries from cooperating against it. By providing investment and loans to countries in the region, China has been able to establish a level of economic dependence that makes it difficult for these countries to cooperate against it. This is particularly true for countries that are heavily reliant on Chinese investment, such as Cambodia and Laos.",
      "Secondly, China has used diplomatic outreach to build partnerships with other countries in the region. By offering development aid and investment, China has been able to build relationships with countries that it sees as important to its regional ambitions. This has allowed China to prevent a coalition from emerging by ensuring that these countries are not aligned against it.",
      "Finally, China has used strategic communication to shape the narrative around its actions in the region. By presenting its activities in the South China Sea as defensive in nature, China has been able to prevent other countries from coalescing around a common position against it. By framing its actions as a response to the actions of other countries, China has been able to create a narrative that has prevented a hard-balancing coalition from emerging.",
      "In conclusion, China has managed to prevent a hard-balancing coalition from emerging in the South China Sea through a combination of economic engagement, diplomatic outreach, and strategic communication. By building partnerships, shaping the narrative, and leveraging economic dependence, China has been able to prevent a coalition from emerging that could challenge its regional ambitions."

CPEC projects are currently underway, with several major infrastructure projects completed, including the Karakoram Highway and the Gwadar Port.",

CPEC is expected to generate around 70,000 direct and 200,000 indirect jobs, which could help reduce unemployment rates in the country. Additionally, CPEC could potentially increase the country's GDP by 2.5% and attract foreign investment.",

One major concern is the construction of dams, which could lead to the displacement of thousands of people and have a significant impact on the environment. Additionally, there are concerns about the potential for environmental degradation due to the development of infrastructure such as roads and highways.",
      "In conclusion, while CPEC projects have the potential to bring economic benefits to Pakistan, there are also concerns about their potential environmental impact. It is important for the government to carefully consider the potential consequences of these projects and take steps to mitigate any negative impacts."

This extensive membership means that RCEP has a larger market size and can potentially bring about more significant trade liberalization effects compared to CPTPP.",

      "Critics argue that RCEP is a shallow agreement compared to the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans -Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) that was praised as the gold standard of trade deals.",

      "However, this argument downplays RCEP\u2019s core trade liberalisation effects, which stem from some of its specific features.",

    "question": "3. What are the specific features of RCEP that promote trade integration and facilitation in the Asia-Pacific region?",
    "answer": [
      "The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) is a proposed free trade agreement (FTA) between the 10 ASEAN member states and their six FTA partners, including Australia, China, India, Japan, South Korea, and New Zealand. RCEP is designed to promote trade integration and facilitation in the Asia-Pacific region by enhancing economic cooperation and reducing barriers to trade. Here are three specific features of RCEP that promote trade integration and facilitation:",
      "1. Elimination of Tariffs: RCEP aims to eliminate tariffs on goods and services traded among its member countries, which will reduce trade costs and increase economic cooperation. By reducing tariffs, RCEP will encourage cross-border trade and investment, leading to increased economic growth and job creation in the region.",
      "2. Liberalization of Services Trade: RCEP seeks to liberalize trade in services, including financial services, telecommunications, and transportation. This will promote competition and increase access to services for businesses and consumers, which will lead to lower prices and improved quality of services.",
      "3. Regulatory Cooperation: RCEP includes provisions for regulatory cooperation, which will promote greater consistency and predictability in the regulatory environment across the region. This will reduce barriers to trade and investment, encourage innovation, and promote sustainable development.",
      "In conclusion, RCEP's specific features of tariff elimination, liberalization of services trade, and regulatory cooperation promote trade integration and facilitation in the Asia-Pacific region by reducing barriers to trade, increasing economic cooperation, and promoting sustainable development. These features will contribute to the growth of the region's economy and improve the standard of living of its people."

      "The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) is a proposed free trade agreement (FTA) between 10 ASEAN member states and their six FTA partners, including Australia, China, Japan, South Korea, and India. While the RCEP offers significant benefits to member countries, there are also potential challenges or drawbacks that need to be addressed.",
      "One potential challenge of RCEP is the lack of balance in the agreement. Some countries, such as Vietnam and Malaysia, have expressed concerns that the agreement may not be balanced, with some sectors being opened up to trade while others remain closed. This lack of balance could lead to winners and losers among member countries, with some industries being hurt by increased competition.",
      "Another potential challenge of RCEP is the potential impact on domestic industries. RCEP aims to reduce tariffs and other barriers to trade, which could lead to increased competition for domestic industries. This could result in job losses and economic disruption, particularly in industries that are already struggling.",
      "Finally, there are concerns about the potential impact of RCEP on the environment. The agreement contains provisions for environmental protection, but there are concerns that these provisions may not be strong enough to prevent environmental degradation. This could be particularly problematic for countries with fragile ecosystems, such as Indonesia and the Philippines.",
      "In conclusion, while the RCEP offers significant benefits to member countries, there are also potential challenges or drawbacks that need to be addressed. These include concerns about the lack of balance in the agreement, the potential impact on domestic industries, and the potential impact on the environment."

The conference aimed to establish a new monetary system and framework for the post-World War II world. The main purpose of the conference was to create an international monetary system that would facilitate the exchange of goods and services among nations and promote economic growth and stability.",
      "The Bretton Woods system was designed to replace the previous system of exchange rates that had been set by the gold standard. The new system allowed for the creation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), which would provide financial assistance to countries recovering from the war. The system also established the US dollar as the primary reserve currency, which was backed by a promise to redeem it for gold at a fixed rate of $35 per ounce.",
      "The Bretton Woods Conference was a significant event in the history of international economic relations, as it established the foundation for the global economic system that has persisted to this day. The system has undergone significant changes over the years, but its basic structure and principles remain in place. The conference also helped to lay the groundwork for the development of international trade and investment, and it paved the way for the growth of multinational corporations and the globalization of the economy."

      "Although it had several critical flaws, the Bretton Woods GEA worked well for more than 60 years arguably until the eruption of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC).",
      "It ushered in the golden age of globalisation and brought about economic growth and prosperity all over the world.",
      "Gradualist Reform & the Changed Context Reforms of this architecture have been implemented in an incremental and gradual manner.",
      "These comprise (i) the establishment of the G7 in 1975 and its upgradation to the G20 summit in the aftermath of the GFC; (ii) a shift to a floating system of exchange rates in 1973 after the collapse of the pegged rates of the Bretton Woods monetary arrangement; (iii) the establishment of the Financial Stability Forum and its upgrading to the Financial Stability Board after the GFC; and (iv) the transitioning from GATT to the WTO in 1995.",
      "More recently, the context in which the global IEIs operate has changed in two important ways.",
      "First, the unipolar world with the US as the sole superpower has become multi -polar where economic and political power has shifted to some extent to the dynamic emerging markets, particularly those in Asia such as China and India.",

      "Over time, this has produced highly integrated global financial markets and capital flows that h ave dwarfed the regulatory capacity and operations of IEIs.",
      "With financial globalisation, a new type of crisis associated with large capital inflows and their sudden reversals have become more frequent occurring every 10 to 12 years.",

    "question": "5. What are the two ways in which the context in which the global economic institutions operate has changed?",
    "answer": [
      "In the past, the global economic institutions operated in a context where the world was more homogeneous, with a dominant Western power and a relatively stable global economic system. However, today's global economic institutions operate in a vastly different context. The world has become increasingly heterogeneous, with the rise of emerging economies, and the global economic system is characterized by greater instability and volatility. These changes have significant implications for the effectiveness of global economic institutions in addressing current economic challenges.",
      "Firstly, the rise of emerging economies has led to a more diverse global economic landscape, with different countries having different economic priorities and policies. This has made it more difficult for global economic institutions to reach consensus on policy issues and has led to more fragmented responses to global economic challenges. For example, the global economic institutions have struggled to come to a consensus on issues related to climate change, with developing countries resisting measures that could impact their economic growth.",
      "Secondly, the global economic system is characterized by greater instability and volatility, with the COVID-19 pandemic being a prime example. This has made it more difficult for global economic institutions to predict and respond to economic shocks, and has highlighted the limitations of their existing governance structures. For example, the global economic institutions were criticized for their slow response to the pandemic, with some arguing that their governance structures were not adequate for dealing with a crisis of this magnitude.",
      "In conclusion, the context in which global economic institutions operate has changed significantly, with the rise of emerging economies and the increasing instability and volatility of the global economic system. These changes have significant implications for the effectiveness of global economic institutions in addressing current economic challenges, and highlight the need for reform and adaptation to meet the needs of the changing global economic landscape."

The proposal also envisages the creation of a new global financial safety net that would provide liquidity and insurance to the global financial system during times of stress.",

Supporters argue that the current global financial system is too unstable and too prone to crises, and that a new system is needed to prevent future crises. Critics, on the other hand, argue that the proposal is overly ambitious and may not be feasible in practice. Nevertheless, the New Bretton Woods proposal has sparked an important debate about the future of the global financial and economic system, and has helped to focus attention on the need for systemic reform."

      "COMMENTARY AT THE historic Bretton Woods Conf erence of 1944, to address the economic instability of the 1930s, a set of rules -based international economic institutions (IEIs) that are collectively referred to as the global economic architecture (GEA) was established under the leadership of the United States.",
      "This architecture comprised the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for macroeconomic and monetary stability; the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \u2013 the predecessor of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to promote trade openness; and the World Bank to provide development finance for poverty reduction.",
      "Although it had several critical flaws, the Bretton Woods GEA worked well for more than 60 years arguably until the eruption of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC).",
      "It ushered in the golden age of globalisation and brought about economic growth and prosperity all over the world.",
      "Gradualist Reform & the Changed Context Reforms of this architecture have been implemented in an incremental and gradual manner.",
      "These comprise (i) the establishment of the G7 in 1975 and its upgradation to the G20 summit in the aftermath of the GFC; (ii) a shift to a floating system of exchange rates in 1973 after the collapse of the pegged rates of the Bretton Woods monetary arrangement; (iii) the establishment of the Financial Stability Forum and its upgrading to the Financial Stability Board after the GFC; and (iv) the transitioning from GATT to the WTO in 1995.",
      "More recently, the context in which the global IEIs operate has changed in two important ways.",
      "First, the unipolar world with the US as the sole superpower has become multi -polar where economic and political power has shifted to some extent to the dynamic emerging markets, particularly those in Asia such as China and India.",
      "These emerging markets have sought a greater voice in the operation of the IEIs.",
      "But the major Western shareholders remain antipathetic to the required changes in rules and policies.",
      "Second, during the Bretton Woods era, policymakers were wary of uncontrolled finance and had imposed restri ctions on cross -border flows of capital.",
      "In the 1990s, under the so -called Washington Consensus, countries around the world deregulated their capital accounts.",
      "Over time, this has produced highly integrated global financial markets and capital flows that h ave dwarfed the regulatory capacity and operations of IEIs.",
      "With financial globalisation, a new type of crisis associated with large capital inflows and their sudden reversals have become more frequent occurring every 10 to 12 years.",
      "In addition to insta bility, financial globalisation has also led to intra - and inter - country income inequality.",
      "Calls for Big Bang Reforms: Bretton Woods 2.0? Calls have, therefore, been made for a comprehensive reform of the Bretton Woods GEA.",
      "In the post -GFC period, a num ber of academics and politicians had called for a New Bretton Woods (NBW), a wider and more comprehensive reform of the GEA.",
      "These had included Professor Joseph Stiglitz and politicians like Nicholas Sarkozy and Gordon Brown.",
      "The then central bank govern or of China, Zhou Xiaochuan, had also made a pitch for a new international reserve asset to replace the US dollar and its hegemony.",
      "The calls for a NBW fizzled out at the interregnum stage because the recovery from the GFC turned out to be faster than ex pected and the world experienced a Great Recession rather than the originally expected repeat of the Great Depression of the 1930s.",
      "This led to complacency and dilution of reform proposals.",
      "Similar calls for comprehensive reforms of the Bretton Wood GEA h ave been made in the wake of the COVID -19 pandemic which has led to the worst global economic downturn since the Great Depression.",
      "According to the latest IMF estimate, world output shrank by 3.1% in 2020 as compared to 0.1% in 2009.",
      "Gallaghar and Kozul -Wright have noted that inequality, indebtedness, and insufficient productive investments have become the new normal and called for a renewed multilateral order.",
      "Tinkering with existing rules cannot provide the way out.",
      "Vines argues that the world now faces two choices (i) revisit the direction of t he mid - 1940s when ruled based GEA were established or (ii) return to the path of the 1930s when weak cooperation led to an economic depression and eventually a world war.",
      "He adds that the crises of this century proves that there is an urgent need for funda mental reform by learning lessons from history.",
      "What lessons can be learned from COVID -19 and the invasion of Ukraine? Will they be game -changing events and lead to the overhaul of the global economic architecture? If so, how? Going Forward Looking for ward, will the calls for Big Bang reform of the Bretton Woods GEA be realised any time soon? Probably, not.",
      "This is because with the recent rise in nationalism and populism worldwide and the on -going conflict between the US and China and the Russia -Ukraine War, the political will to spur global cooperation and coordination is weak and risk of yet another East -West divide reminiscent of the Cold War era world order is genuine.",
      "Under former President Trump, the US had embraced the \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy and protectionism pivoting away from multilateralism of the past to \u201cunilateralism\u201d and \u201cbilateralism\u201d.",
      "President Biden is supportive of multilateralism but still many of the tariffs that were imposed on about 20% of total imports of the US remain.",
      "Similarl y, European countries had initiated policy actions to protect their economies especially from rising inflows of migrant workers from the Middle East.",
      "Countries around the world also retaliated and became more inward -looking.",
      "Although it remains an export p owerhouse, China has also stressed the importance of domestic market when it rolled out the \u201cdual circulation\u201d policy paradigm.",
      "Since 2020, India has also adopted a more self -reliant policy.",
      "Rising nationalism and growing emphasis on economic security hav e dimmed the environment for global cooperation.",
      "Countries are preferring to \u201cgo it alone\u201d rather than cooperate with others.",
      "Weak political will is the main reason why the G20 has failed to craft a coordinated global response to the unprecedented COVID -19 pandemic.",
      "In the medium -term, therefore, reforms of the Bretton Woods GEA are expected to be incremental and gradual rather than Big Bang.",
      "The key focus of reforms should be to provide global public goods in a shared manner by promoting complementarity between global and regional IEIs that have been recently established.",
      "The centralised Bretton Woods GEA is gradually moving towards a decentralising GEA with the co -existence of \u201csenior\u201d global IEIs and a plethora of new regional institutions.",

      "pandemic? Provide evidence and examples to support your argument.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the global economic architecture, causing widespread disruptions and challenges to the traditional systems and practices that underpin the global economy. The pandemic has resulted in the closure of borders, reduced trade and investment flows, and a shift towards remote work, among other changes.",
      "One of the most significant impacts of the pandemic on the global economic architecture has been the shift towards digital and remote work. With many businesses and organizations forced to close their physical locations, remote work has become a necessity for many employees. This shift has created new challenges for employers and employees alike, such as maintaining productivity and ensuring the security of digital platforms and data.",
      "Another impact of the pandemic on the global economic architecture has been the disruption of supply chains and global trade. With many countries implementing border closures and travel restrictions, businesses have struggled to access the goods and materials they need to produce their products. This has resulted in production delays, increased costs, and reduced profits for many companies.",
      "Finally, the pandemic has highlighted the need for greater global cooperation and coordination in responding to economic crises. With the global economy becoming increasingly interconnected, the pandemic has shown that even small disruptions can have far-reaching and severe consequences. To address these challenges, it is essential that governments, businesses, and organizations work together to develop new strategies and systems that can better withstand future economic shocks.",
      "Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the global economic architecture, creating new challenges and opportunities for businesses, governments, and individuals around the world. While the full extent of these impacts is still being felt, it is clear that the pandemic has forced us to rethink and reimagine the systems and practices that underpin the global economy."

      "The onset of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) in Balochistan has had a significant impact on the Baloch groups. The CPEC is a multi-billion-dollar infrastructure project that aims to connect China's western region to the Gwadar Port in Balochistan, Pakistan. The project is expected to provide a trade route for China to access the Arabian Sea and is seen as a game-changer for the region. However, the Baloch groups have been critical of the project, arguing that it will displace them from their land and resources and that the benefits of the project will not reach them.",
      "The Baloch groups have been fighting for their rights and autonomy in Balochistan for decades. They argue that the province has been historically neglected and marginalized by the central government in Islamabad. The CPEC has further exacerbated their grievances as they feel that their land is being taken away from them without adequate compensation or consultation. The Baloch National Front, an opposition party in Balochistan, has stated that the CPEC is a \"colossal disaster\" for the people of Balochistan and that it will lead to the exploitation of their resources.",
      "The Baloch groups have resorted to violence in their fight for autonomy. The Baloch Liberation Army, a militant group, has carried out several attacks on CPEC infrastructure, including the bombing of a motorway construction site in 2019. The government has responded with force, with security forces launching operations in Balochistan to crack down on militancy. The military operation has led to allegations of human rights abuses and displacement of locals.",
      "In conclusion, the onset of the CPEC in Balochistan has had a significant impact on the Baloch groups. The project has further exacerbated their grievances and led to violence and human rights abuses. The Baloch groups are calling for greater consultation and compensation for the impact of the project on their land and resources."

    "question": "2. What is the significance of Germany's decision to equip its armed forces and think strategically about the defence of and challenges for Germany and Europe?",
    "answer": [
      "The significance of Germany's decision to equip its armed forces and think strategically about the defense of and challenges for Germany and Europe is multifaceted. Firstly, it demonstrates Germany's commitment to playing a more active role in European and global security. By investing in its military capabilities, Germany is signaling that it is willing to take on greater responsibility for its own security and the security of its allies. This is particularly important given the increasing complexity and uncertainty of the security landscape, with threats such as terrorism, cyberattacks, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.",
      "Secondly, the decision to equip its armed forces and think strategically is a response to the changing security environment in Europe. With the end of the Cold War and the rise of new security challenges, Germany and other European countries have had to adapt their defense policies to meet new threats. By investing in its military capabilities and developing a more strategic approach to defense, Germany is demonstrating its commitment to playing its part in addressing these challenges.",
      "Finally, the decision to equip its armed forces and think strategically is also significant for Germany's relationship with the United States and NATO. While Germany has long been a member of NATO and has contributed to international security through its participation in peacekeeping missions and other military operations, it has been reluctant to invest heavily in its own military capabilities. By investing in its military capabilities and taking a more strategic approach to defense, Germany is signaling its commitment to NATO and its role in supporting the alliance's goals and objectives."

      "COMMENTARY IT IS futile to debate whether Russian President Vladimir Putin had anticipated the determination and unity of Europe or was surprised by it.",
      "But as a matter of fact, the European Union (EU) and its member states are currently untying several \u201cGordian Knots\u201d at once.",
      "Take Germany as an example: Russian aggression has achieved what decades of US diplomacy could not: Berlin is finally realising that Germany must take care of its own, and by extension European, security.",
      "For decades, Germany\u2019s European neighbours, from France to Poland, as well as successive US administrations have tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to put an end to German free -riding on the NA TO and US security umbrella.",
      "Berlin had long been lacking to both equip its armed forces, the Bundeswehr, adequately and to think strategically about the defence of and challenges for Germany and Europe.",
      "The Historic German Volte -face Despite being the second largest NATO economy, hitherto, it was hopeless to expect Germany to meet its NATO defence budget obligations of 2% of GDP.",
      "Berlin\u2019s strategic culture , domestic politics and an entrenched public pacificism made raising the defence budget as difficult as developing a realistic security strategy appropriate for a country so prone to geopolitical challenges.",
      "Likewise, the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with Moscow was long a \u201choly cow\u201d of Berlin\u2019s diplomacy, preventing both the export of arms to Ukraine as wel l as unambiguously joining its NATO allies in hard -balancing Russian influence.",
      "For example, the much - discussed gas pipeline Nordstream 2 was, despite its obvious geo -strategic nature, long described as a \u201ccommercial project\u201d by successive German governments.",
      "In a series of dramatic moves within just a few days, Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced a historic volte -face that seemed to take even members of his own government by surprise.",
      "Upending decades -old fundamental principles of German foreign and security policy, Berlin is now delivering lethal weapons to Ukraine, announced a one -off tripling of th e defence budget as well as the intent to henceforth meet NATO\u2019s spending target.",
      "Likewise, to reduce Germany\u2019s significant dependency on Russian energy imports (every fourth household relies on Russian gas for heating), even Green party leaders agree tha t Berlin will now likely have to postpone its exit from both coal - and nuclear - energy, and Nordstream 2 is now all but finished.",
      "New EU Unity The President of the European Commission announced a series of measures that denoted a similarly remarkable shif t in EU Common Security and Defence Policy.",
      "Most astonishing for an organisation that self -identifies as a \u201cnormative actor\u201d, the EU will now for the first time finance lethal weapons.",
      "To that end, \u20ac450 million will go towards Ukrainian armament \u2013 a countr y that is not even a member.",
      "Beyond defence, member states demonstrated unusual unity in agreeing to substantial sanctions against Russia, including the long -resisted removal of Russia\u2019s leading banks from SWIFT.",
      "Not only will this come at significant cos ts for European economies themselves, but this agreement also bridges the traditionally significant divergence in European perspectives on economic and diplomatic relations with Moscow.",
      "No less remarkable, only six years after the so -called refugee crisi s brought the EU close to breaking point, even those member states that long resisted EU -wide refugee distribution, indeed were opposed to receiving any migrants at all, are now welcoming Ukrainian refugees with open arms.",
      "Never Waste A Crisis: Europe\u2019s Moment of Truth \u201cEurope will be forged in crisis\u201d, Jean Monnet, one of the EU\u2019s founding fathers, famously asserted.",
      "Indeed, there seems to be nothing quite like a geopolitical crisis to remind member states of the mutual security imperative of r egional integration, to galvanise and unify Europe.",
      "Indeed even Boris Johnson shows a renewed interests in cooperation with the EU.",
      "This momentum should not be squandered.",
      "In the medium -term, there might be a welcomed spill -over effect, possibly solving one of Europe\u2019s most intractable problems: creating a functioning migration regime.",
      "If the rest of the EU shows now this forthcoming solidarity with its Eastern member states that these states lacked during the 2015 refugee crisis, Europe might once again find the cooperative spirit to progress with deeper integration and policy reform, strengthening Europe\u2019s collective capacity.",
      "Similarly, substantial German investment in defence can significantly enhance Europe\u2019s defence capacity and work towards Europe\u2019 s ability to implement own strategic objectives.",
      "Mindful that a shortage of money was never the Bundeswehr\u2019s primary problem, greater defence spending must be accompanied by structural reforms and strategic embedding of German capabilities in a European fr amework.",
      "A Re -energised Europe? Lastly, part of the truth about Europe\u2019s new unity is the fact that for the first time in decades, Washington very closely cooperated with both NATO allies and the EU institutions on a collective response to a security cri sis.",
      "This cooperative spirit is, however, highly dependent on personalities rather than permanent structural change of US foreign policy.",
      "It is indeed likely that a second Trump administration had reacted very differently, side -lining rather than galvanis ing European cooperation, which would likely have led to political inertia rather than resolve in Europe.",
      "It is time to seriously consider advancing Europe\u2019s \u201cstrategic autonomy\u201d.",
      "This does not mean competition with NATO.",
      "Rather, strategic autonomy should be a European capacity to determine own strategic interests with the means to achieve them \u2013 complementary with but independent from NATO.",
      "Putin has unwittingly shaken Europe out of complacency.",
      "The previously unimaginable is suddenly reality, and the E U is already stronger and more effective and attractive than before Putin\u2019s war against Ukraine.",
      "A second \u201cBrexit -like\u201d scenario seems unlikely now, and if there is only one good thing that may come out of this tragedy, it might be a re -energised Europe."

      "And while the Initiative does not directly mention the need for ethics in AI, it does recognise the public\u2019s mounting concern around data privacy a nd acknowledges the need for international cooperation to ensure confidence and trust in AI systems.",
      "Soon after the White House announced its AI Initiat ive, the Pentagon released its own strategy framed around the concept of a \u201chuman-centered app roach to AI\u201d.",
      "In an effort to dispel public fears of killer robots and showcas e the beneficial uses of AI, the strategy focused not on AI and lethality, but on de veloping AI systems that are robust, reliable, and secure.",
      "In addition to the Pentagon\u2019s strategy, the Defence Innovation Board (DiB), an advisory council made up of primarily private indus try leaders, is in the latter stages of developing a series of \u201c AI Principles for Defence .\u201d The DiB hopes these principles will guide the Pentagon\u2019s development and use of AI syst ems moving forward.",

      "COMMENTARY THE TRUCE between the United States and China has f inally ended, as the trade talks collapsed in Washington DC last month.",

      "After three days, China immed iately responded by declaring that they would impose tariffs of up to 25% on 5,140 Ame rican products amounting to $60 billion.",
      "On the same day, the United States Trade Representa tives (USTR) drafted a list of 3,805 Chinese products valued at approximately $300 billion dollars that could be subject to potential tariffs up to 25%.",
      "On 30 May, it was reported that China put on hold the purchase of American soybeans that come fr om the Midwest farm belt, the core constituencies of the US president Donald Trum p.",
      "And before leaving for the D- Day Ceremony in Normandy recently, US President Don ald Trump made another fresh threat that he could go for tariffs on anothe r $300 billion of Chinese goods at the right time, which means he might slap tariffs on vi rtually every Chinese export.",
      "Tit-for-Tat Tit-for-tat tariff strategies by the two great powe rs are one of the worst outcomes from the breakdown of the talks, but they are not that s urprising, since the US and China had already gone through similar phases last year.",
      "What was not fully expected this time is that the s tandoff between the US and China that started as skirmishes over tariff issues is no w taking a completely new turn, as the two countries are plunging into conflicts over almost everything, including technology, diplomatic, and geopolitical issues wit h no signs of ending.",
      "Even when the two sides announced retaliatory tarif fs against each other in May, there seemed to be a silver lining for a negotiated settl ement, since the two countries were evidently seeking concessions, delaying the effects of retaliatory tariffs until imports from one country reach the port of another on 1 Jun e.",
      "Then why did the US-China trade talk fail all of sudden? Differing Expectations Many sources say that the two parties had quite dif ferent expectations about implementation of the draft agreement, which was co mplicated by the dynamics of domestic politics in each side.",
      "Last March, China p assed a new Foreign Investment law at the National People\u2019s Congress in efforts to attract foreign investors, while the trade conflict with the US has sparked its economic downturn.",
      "Chinese officials were quite reluctant to make any further legal changes to improve the outcome of the trade talks, as they believe tha t the newly drafted investment law provides foreign firms with fair treatment and prot ection from illegal interference from the Chinese government.",

      "Like the European Union and many other critics, they see that China\u2019s new i nvestment law does not really go very far, as it remains vague and broad on the issu es of forced technology transfers, intellectual property rights, and know-how disclosu re.",
      "China wanted to carry out the agreement by administ rative actions without legal commitments.",
      "In contrast, the US wanted to specify changes that China needs to make in legal terms and publicly disclose them in o rder to institutionalise an enforcement mechanism.",
      "Both sides were equally conc erned about domestic criticisms of weak deals.",

      "The two great economies have ind eed embarked on a war over a new global order that will not be resolved any time soon.",
      "By implementing toughest sanctions on China\u2019s Huawe i and declaring a national emergency on information security, the Trump admini stration made it clear that they are seeking to thwart \u2018Made in 2025\u2019, a blueprint f or China\u2019s developmental plans to become a manufacturing powerhouse with an emphasis on high-tech sectors.",
      "It is worth noting that the US\u2019 current stance on C hina has no bipartisan differences.",
      "Despite their ongoing feuds, the Democratic Party a sked the Trump administration to be tough on China\u2019s \u201cbad behaviours,\u201d including reg ulatory behaviours, unfair trade practices, and human rights issues.",
      "Strong statements on the Tiananmen Square protests came from both the US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Secretary of the State Mike Pompeo, while the US House passed pro-Taiwanese bills at around the same time.",
      "Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping urged the C hinese people to start the new \u201cLong March\u201d with loyalty and unity for the nation\u2019 s great survival during his visit to Jiangxi province, where the Red Army of the Chinese Communist Party undertook its historic military retreat against the Kuomintang fr om 1934 to 1935.",

      "The IMF Director C hristine Lagarde has recently warned that retaliatory tariffs by the US and China will cause a reduction of 2020 global growth by $455 billion.",
      "Another dilemma in the current spat between the US and China is that some countries will be forced to take sides, as shown in the relat ionship between the US, China, and South Korea.",
      "Harry Harris, the US Ambassador to Sou th Korea has recently urged Korean telecommunication companies not to use Huawe i network equipment, emphasising the importance of a reliability of 5G s uppliers for national security.",

      "Even when the two sides announced retaliatory tarif fs against each other in May, there seemed to be a silver lining for a negotiated settl ement, since the two countries were evidently seeking concessions, delaying the effects of retaliatory tariffs until imports from one country reach the port of another on 1 Jun e.",
      "Then why did the US-China trade talk fail all of sudden? Differing Expectations Many sources say that the two parties had quite dif ferent expectations about implementation of the draft agreement, which was co mplicated by the dynamics of domestic politics in each side.",
      "Last March, China p assed a new Foreign Investment law at the National People\u2019s Congress in efforts to attract foreign investors, while the trade conflict with the US has sparked its economic downturn.",
      "Chinese officials were quite reluctant to make any further legal changes to improve the outcome of the trade talks, as they believe tha t the newly drafted investment law provides foreign firms with fair treatment and prot ection from illegal interference from the Chinese government.",
      "The Trump administration and American firms did not agree.",
      "Like the European Union and many other critics, they see that China\u2019s new i nvestment law does not really go very far, as it remains vague and broad on the issu es of forced technology transfers, intellectual property rights, and know-how disclosu re.",
      "China wanted to carry out the agreement by administ rative actions without legal commitments.",
      "In contrast, the US wanted to specify changes that China needs to make in legal terms and publicly disclose them in o rder to institutionalise an enforcement mechanism.",
      "Both sides were equally conc erned about domestic criticisms of weak deals.",
      "Evolution of Trade War Recent developments after the breakdown of the trad e talks show that the current standoff between the US and China is not just trigg ered by the spontaneous reactions of strong leaders.",
      "The two great economies have ind eed embarked on a war over a new global order that will not be resolved any time soon.",
      "By implementing toughest sanctions on China\u2019s Huawe i and declaring a national emergency on information security, the Trump admini stration made it clear that they are seeking to thwart \u2018Made in 2025\u2019, a blueprint f or China\u2019s developmental plans to become a manufacturing powerhouse with an emphasis on high-tech sectors.",
      "It is worth noting that the US\u2019 current stance on C hina has no bipartisan differences.",
      "Despite their ongoing feuds, the Democratic Party a sked the Trump administration to be tough on China\u2019s \u201cbad behaviours,\u201d including reg ulatory behaviours, unfair trade practices, and human rights issues.",
      "Strong statements on the Tiananmen Square protests came from both the US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Secretary of the State Mike Pompeo, while the US House passed pro-Taiwanese bills at around the same time.",
      "Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping urged the C hinese people to start the new \u201cLong March\u201d with loyalty and unity for the nation\u2019 s great survival during his visit to Jiangxi province, where the Red Army of the Chinese Communist Party undertook its historic military retreat against the Kuomintang fr om 1934 to 1935.",
      "Jiangxi province is also housing mining facilities for rare earth miner als that China might weaponise in its trade war with the US.",
      "Emerging Dilemmas How would the US-China frictions affect the global trading system? The damage seems to have been already done.",
      "The IMF Director C hristine Lagarde has recently warned that retaliatory tariffs by the US and China will cause a reduction of 2020 global growth by $455 billion.",
      "Another dilemma in the current spat between the US and China is that some countries will be forced to take sides, as shown in the relat ionship between the US, China, and South Korea.",
      "Harry Harris, the US Ambassador to Sou th Korea has recently urged Korean telecommunication companies not to use Huawe i network equipment, emphasising the importance of a reliability of 5G s uppliers for national security.",
      "It was just a day after Chinese diplomats warned th e Korean press that Korea should make a good judgement instead of following the pref erences of the US.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping will resolve the deadlock between the two countries at the G20 Summi t in Japan later this month as they did in Buenos Aires in December 2018.",
      "Whatever the outcomes, it will be still subject to certain volatility caused by the two cou ntries\u2019 fight over global hegemony."

    "answer": [
      "Having a clear and comprehensive public health emergency strategy is essential for effectively managing and responding to emergencies that threaten the health of a population. Here are three key claims that support this importance:",
      "Firstly, a clear and comprehensive public health emergency strategy ensures that resources are allocated efficiently during an emergency. This is crucial as it helps to prevent duplication of efforts and ensures that resources are directed towards the most critical areas. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, countries with well-developed emergency strategies were able to allocate resources more effectively, leading to better health outcomes.",
      "Secondly, a clear and comprehensive public health emergency strategy helps to ensure that the public is informed and can take appropriate measures to protect their health. This is especially important during a pandemic, where the spread of disease can be rapid and unpredictable. A well-developed strategy helps to ensure that the public is aware of the latest guidance and recommendations, and can take steps to protect themselves and others.",
      "Finally, a clear and comprehensive public health emergency strategy helps to ensure that healthcare workers are prepared and can respond effectively to an emergency. This is crucial as healthcare workers are often on the frontlines of an emergency and must be prepared to respond quickly and effectively. A well-developed strategy helps to ensure that healthcare workers have the necessary training and resources to respond to an emergency, and that they are able to work safely and effectively.",
      "In conclusion, having a clear and comprehensive public health emergency strategy is crucial for managing and responding to emergencies that threaten the health of a population. It ensures that resources are allocated efficiently, the public is informed, and healthcare workers are prepared to respond effectively."

    "question": "8. What is the importance",
    "answer": [
      "The importance of the sociological imagination cannot be overstated. It is the ability to understand and interpret the world around us from a sociological perspective, which allows us to see beyond the surface level of events and understand the underlying social forces that shape them. The sociological imagination enables us to recognize and analyze the complex social structures and relationships that influence our lives and the world we live in. It also allows us to critically evaluate our own experiences and the experiences of others in a broader societal context.",
      "One of the key benefits of the sociological imagination is that it helps us to see the world from multiple perspectives. It allows us to recognize that our own experiences are shaped by a complex interplay of social, cultural, and historical factors, and that others may have different experiences based on similar factors. This can help us to develop empathy and understanding for others, and to engage in more meaningful and productive interactions with them.",
      "Additionally, the sociological imagination is essential for understanding and addressing social issues. By recognizing the underlying social structures and systems that contribute to these issues, we can develop more effective strategies for addressing them. For example, recognizing the ways in which poverty is shaped by social and economic structures can lead to more effective anti-poverty initiatives.",
      "Overall, the sociological imagination is a crucial tool for understanding the world and addressing social issues. It allows us to see beyond our own experiences and perspectives, and to develop a more nuanced and critical understanding of the social structures and relationships that shape our lives."

The militants have engaged in acts of violence and terror, which have resulted in the loss of innocent lives, destruction of property, and displacement of people from their homes. In addition, the militants have also perpetuated a culture of fear and intimidation, which has led to a breakdown of social norms and values in the region.",
      "Furthermore, the militants' actions have been widely condemned by the international community, which has called for a peaceful and negotiated settlement to the conflict in Jammu and Kashmir. The Indian government has also made efforts to address the root causes of the conflict, including poverty, unemployment, and lack of educational opportunities, through various developmental initiatives. These efforts have been successful in improving the quality of life for the people of Jammu and Kashmir, and have received widespread support from the local population.",
      "In conclusion, the counter-narrative to the success claims of the militants is that their actions have caused immense harm to the local population, have been widely condemned by the international community, and have not resulted in any lasting political or territorial gains for the people of Jammu and Kashmir."

    "question": "5. What is the strategy of the Armed Forces of the Philippines' Western Mindanao Command (Westmincom) to diminish the capabilities of IS-affiliated ASG in Sulu, Basilan and Tawi-Tawi provinces?",
    "answer": [
      "The Armed Forces of the Philippines' Western Mindanao Command (Westmincom) has employed a multi-pronged strategy to diminish the capabilities of the IS-affiliated Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) in Sulu, Basilan, and Tawi-Tawi provinces. This strategy involves a combination of military operations, intelligence gathering, and community engagement.",
      "Firstly, Westmincom has conducted numerous military operations against ASG, aiming to disrupt their capabilities and limit their ability to carry out attacks. These operations have resulted in the killing or capture of key ASG leaders and the disruption of their supply lines. Additionally, Westmincom has been working to build the capacity of the Philippine military to better respond to security threats in the region, including through the provision of training and equipment.",
      "Secondly, Westmincom has been working to gather intelligence on ASG, including their movements, activities, and networks. This has involved the use of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) assets, as well as the coordination with local communities to gather information. By improving its intelligence capabilities, Westmincom has been able to better anticipate and respond to ASG attacks.",
      "Finally, Westmincom has been engaging with local communities in Sulu, Basilan, and Tawi-Tawi provinces to build trust and cooperation. This has involved working with local leaders to address underlying grievances and promote economic development in the region. By building strong relationships with local communities, Westmincom has been able to limit the support that ASG receives from within the population.",
      "In conclusion, Westmincom's strategy to diminish the capabilities of IS-affiliated ASG in Sulu, Basilan, and Tawi-Tawi provinces involves a combination of military operations, intelligence gathering, and community engagement. By taking a comprehensive approach to addressing the security threat posed by ASG, Westmincom has been able to make significant progress in reducing their capabilities and limiting their ability to carry out attacks."

      "Commentary ON 29 DECEMBER 2017, a video surfaced on a website known to be associated with the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and Syria or ISIS, called Khayr Wilayah Media.",
      "Eight minutes long, the clip \u2013 in Arabic and English \u2013 featured footage of ISIS attacks in Paris and Nice, interspersing these with scenes from Middle Eastern conflict zones as well as festivities in Western capitals su ch as Sydney and New York City.",
      "The video also included a segment in which the know n Singaporean ISIS militant Megat Shahdan Abdul Samad, also known as Abu Uqayl, led two other Southeast Asian-looking ISIS fighters in executing three knee ling Arab-looking prisoners, with gunshots at point blank range.",
      "Before carrying out the cold-blooded shootings, Abu Uqayl addressed the camera in English, urging ISIS supporters to kill all \u201cunbelievers\u201d and \u201capostates\u201d from East Asia to the west of Afric a.",
      "Some Broad Observations The video clip has garnered much attention on socia l media, prompting the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) to condemn th e clip, asserting that it represented a \u201cdesperate attack\u201d by ISIS to drive a wedge between Muslims and non- Muslims.",
      "A few broad observations about this latest clip appear pertinent: First , with Abu Uqayl\u2019s videotaped killing of an unarmed prisoner, a certain psychological and symbolic barrier has been crossed.",
      "He had killed a man in cold blood for what he believed to be a righteous religi ous cause and recorded it for all to see.",
      "His criminal act along with many other such at rocities by ISIS in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere, underscores the susceptibility of some i ndividuals to violent religious fanaticism.",
      "The danger of such acts is that they could inspire impressionable and disaffected individuals to carry out copy-cat attacks.",
      "As MUIS warned, such \u201cvideos prey on the minds of the weak, or those who do not have proper religious guidance\u201d.",
      "In September 2014, the Australian police thwarted plans by young supporters of ISIS in Sydney to carry out videotaped beheadings \u2013 \u201cdemonstration ki llings\u201d -- of random members of the public, similar to what ISIS was doing at the s ame time in Iraq and Syria with captured enemies.",
      "Second , the tactical bar for staging violent attacks has been lowered as well.",
      "ISIS propaganda for some time now has called for what ha s been termed the \u201cweaponisation of everyday life\u201d.",
      "In other words, i nstead of getting hold of firearms or learning how to make improvised explosives from the Internet, all that is needed to wreak havoc in densely populated cities like New Yo rk, Barcelona, London and for that matter Singapore, are everyday items like cars , trucks and knives.",
      "It is worth noting in this regard that in the same clip featuring Uqayl, another Malaysian militant identified as Muhammad Aqif Heusen Rahizat , assured supporters that if they cannot make it to Syria to join ISIS Central, they could do so in their respective countries.",
      "The clarion call to would-be lone wolves could not be clearer: carry out attacks wherever you are.",
      "East Asia Still A Target Third , Abu Uqayl\u2019s injunction to kill \u201cunbelievers\u201d and \u201capostates\u201d from East Asia to Africa are most telling.",
      "It affirms that despite th e defeat of ISIS-backed militant groups seeking to carve out a territorial base in Marawi C ity in Mindanao last October, ISIS Central still identifies \u201cEast Asia\u201d as an area whe re they want to establish a wilayat or regional province.",
      "Furthermore, Uqayl\u2019s violent exhortation suggests h is deep indoctrination in the virulent, skewed ISIS interpretation of Islamic tex ts to justify extreme violence.",
      "This is a complex issue, but suffice to say that ISIS basic ally emphasises the so-called \u201csword verses\u201d of the Quran, totally ignoring other passag es and traditions that counterbalance the former and provide a more textur ed and nuanced understanding of the faith.",
      "Finally , Uqayl and ISIS\u2019 use of terms such as \u201c kuffar \u201d (or \u201c kafir \u201d - unbeliever) and \u201cmurtadin \u201d (apostate) in the context of extremist propaganda speaks to the dehumanising effects of indoctrination in violent e xtremist ideology.",
      "Social psychological literature is replete with warnings t hat linguistic dehumanisation is a slippery slope that, in conjunction with political, social, economic and ideological factors, can pave the way towards out-group violenc e.",
      "The dehumanising of out-groups \u2013 before extremist i deology even enters the picture - can occur imperceptibly through the spread of exces sively puritanical interpretations of a religion.",
      "Overly puritanical interpretations of Islam - or an y other faith for that matter - that entrenches a dehumanising mindset towards other gro ups, may well \u201csoften up\u201d impressionable individuals to the violent extremist ideologies of the likes of ISIS and produce more Abu Uqayls.",
      "Implications In sum, the latest video clip suggests two major im plications as we begin the new year.",
      "First, continued public vigilance, as the ongoing S G Secure campaign seeks to promote, remains important in view of the threat of lone wolf attacks.",
      "Second, countering the content and dissemination of ISIS extremist ideology should continue apace, accompanied by parallel efforts by religious leaders to strengthen wider interpretations of the faith that eschew star k, us-versus-them categorical thinking.",
      "These include emphasising respect for not just co-religionists but all humanity, as equally enjoined by the faith.",
      "As MUIS rightly observed, Islam contains within its rich heritage intellectual resources that amply recognise \u201cthe sanctity of human life\u201d.",
      "Rediscovering and reasserting this aspect of the faith\u2019s proud heritage \u2013 through, for instance, deeper theological excavation of the longstanding, tolerant traditions espoused within Islam, and widely practised in the Southeast Asian region -- seems an increasingly pertinent task."

    "question": "2. What is the significance of the video clip featuring Megat Shahdan Abdul Samad (Abu Uqayl)?",
    "answer": [
      "The video clip featuring Megat Shahdan Abdul Samad (Abu Uqayl) is significant as it highlights the growing trend of online radicalization in Malaysia, particularly among the younger generation. This clip serves as a cautionary tale for parents and educators to be vigilant in identifying signs of radicalization in their children and to take proactive measures to prevent them from being drawn into extremist ideologies.",
      "Firstly, the clip showcases the ease with which young individuals can be radicalized online, as Abu Uqayl was able to recruit other young Malaysians to join ISIS without much difficulty. This underscores the need for parents and educators to be aware of the potential risks of social media and online platforms, and to monitor their children's online activities to prevent them from being exposed to extremist content.",
      "Secondly, the clip highlights the importance of de-radicalization programs and initiatives in addressing the issue of online radicalization. The Malaysian government has implemented various programs to counter radicalization, such as the \"Stop 101\" campaign, which aims to counter the narrative of ISIS recruiters. However, more needs to be done to address the root causes of radicalization, such as poverty, inequality, and lack of opportunities, and to provide support to individuals who may be at risk of radicalization.",
      "Finally, the clip serves as a reminder of the urgent need for a comprehensive and coordinated approach to countering violent extremism. This includes addressing the root causes of radicalization, preventing individuals from being radicalized in the first place, and addressing the security threats posed by foreign terrorist fighters who return to their home countries. It is only through a collective effort by governments, civil society, and the private sector that we can effectively counter the threat of online radicalization and ensure the safety and security of our communities."

      "Commentary ON 29 DECEMBER 2017, a video surfaced on a website known to be associated with the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and Syria or ISIS, called Khayr Wilayah Media.",
      "Eight minutes long, the clip \u2013 in Arabic and English \u2013 featured footage of ISIS attacks in Paris and Nice, interspersing these with scenes from Middle Eastern conflict zones as well as festivities in Western capitals su ch as Sydney and New York City.",
      "The video also included a segment in which the know n Singaporean ISIS militant Megat Shahdan Abdul Samad, also known as Abu Uqayl, led two other Southeast Asian-looking ISIS fighters in executing three knee ling Arab-looking prisoners, with gunshots at point blank range.",
      "Before carrying out the cold-blooded shootings, Abu Uqayl addressed the camera in English, urging ISIS supporters to kill all \u201cunbelievers\u201d and \u201capostates\u201d from East Asia to the west of Afric a.",
      "Some Broad Observations The video clip has garnered much attention on socia l media, prompting the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) to condemn th e clip, asserting that it represented a \u201cdesperate attack\u201d by ISIS to drive a wedge between Muslims and non- Muslims.",
      "A few broad observations about this latest clip appear pertinent: First , with Abu Uqayl\u2019s videotaped killing of an unarmed prisoner, a certain psychological and symbolic barrier has been crossed.",
      "He had killed a man in cold blood for what he believed to be a righteous religi ous cause and recorded it for all to see.",
      "His criminal act along with many other such at rocities by ISIS in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere, underscores the susceptibility of some i ndividuals to violent religious fanaticism.",
      "The danger of such acts is that they could inspire impressionable and disaffected individuals to carry out copy-cat attacks.",
      "As MUIS warned, such \u201cvideos prey on the minds of the weak, or those who do not have proper religious guidance\u201d.",
      "In September 2014, the Australian police thwarted plans by young supporters of ISIS in Sydney to carry out videotaped beheadings \u2013 \u201cdemonstration ki llings\u201d -- of random members of the public, similar to what ISIS was doing at the s ame time in Iraq and Syria with captured enemies.",
      "Second , the tactical bar for staging violent attacks has been lowered as well.",

      "In other words, i nstead of getting hold of firearms or learning how to make improvised explosives from the Internet, all that is needed to wreak havoc in densely populated cities like New Yo rk, Barcelona, London and for that matter Singapore, are everyday items like cars , trucks and knives.",
      "It is worth noting in this regard that in the same clip featuring Uqayl, another Malaysian militant identified as Muhammad Aqif Heusen Rahizat , assured supporters that if they cannot make it to Syria to join ISIS Central, they could do so in their respective countries.",
      "The clarion call to would-be lone wolves could not be clearer: carry out attacks wherever you are.",
      "East Asia Still A Target Third , Abu Uqayl\u2019s injunction to kill \u201cunbelievers\u201d and \u201capostates\u201d from East Asia to Africa are most telling.",

    "question": "3. How does the video clip impact the perception of ISIS supporters towards non-Muslims?",

The speaker asserts that non-Muslims should not be considered as \"infidels\" and should be treated with respect. This viewpoint aligns with the concept of \"taqiyya\" which is a principle in Islam that allows Muslims to conceal their beliefs in certain situations where their safety or well-being may be at risk.",
      "This message has the potential to impact the perception of ISIS supporters towards non-Muslims. The speaker's viewpoint emphasizes the importance of treating non-Muslims with respect and not judging them based on their religion.

    "question": "4. What is the significance of the tactical bar being lowered for staging violent attacks?",
    "answer": [
      "In the context of staging violent attacks, the tactical bar being lowered can have significant implications for the effectiveness of such tactics. Lowering the tactical bar refers to reducing the level of sophistication or planning required to execute a violent attack. This can make it easier for individuals or groups to carry out attacks, even if they lack the resources or expertise of more sophisticated actors.",
      "One key claim is that lowering the tactical bar can increase the frequency and lethality of violent attacks. By reducing the level of planning and coordination required, individuals or groups may be more likely to carry out attacks, and these attacks may be more successful. This can lead to a rise in the number of casualties and a greater impact on public safety.",
      "Another claim is that lowering the tactical bar can have a destabilizing effect on society. When attacks become more frequent and less predictable, individuals may feel more fear and insecurity, which can lead to a breakdown in social cohesion and trust. This can have a ripple effect on other aspects of society, such as economic stability and political stability.",
      "Finally, another claim is that lowering the tactical bar can be counterproductive for extremist groups. While lowering the bar may make it easier for some individuals to carry out attacks, it may also make it easier for law enforcement and intelligence agencies to detect and prevent attacks. This can undermine the credibility of extremist groups and reduce their ability to recruit new members."

    "question": "5. What is the significance of Abu Uqayl's injunction to kill \"unbelievers\" and \"apostates\" from East Asia to Africa?",
    "answer": [
      "Abu Uqayl's injunction to kill \"unbelievers\" and \"apostates\" from East Asia to Africa holds significant implications for the Islamic world. Firstly, it emphasizes the need for strict adherence to Islamic law and doctrine, which can be interpreted as a call for religious purity and uniformity. This can lead to a narrow-minded view of the world, where non-Muslims and those who do not follow the strict interpretation of Islam are seen as inferior and deserving of death.",
      "Secondly, Abu Uqayl's injunction can be seen as a call for violence and extremism, which can be detrimental to interfaith relations and global peace. It promotes a view of Islam that is divisive and intolerant, and can be used to justify violence and terrorism. This can lead to a cycle of violence and retribution, which can be harmful to both Muslims and non-Muslims.",
      "Lastly, Abu Uqayl's injunction can be seen as a violation of human rights and international law. It promotes the idea that certain individuals or groups can be killed without due process or trial, which is a violation of basic human rights. This can be seen as a call for the establishment of a theocratic state, where the ruling elite has the power to interpret and enforce Islamic law without any checks or balances.",
      "In conclusion, Abu Uqayl's injunction to kill \"unbelievers\" and \"apostates\" from East Asia to Africa is significant because it highlights the need for strict adherence to Islamic law and doctrine, can be used to justify violence and extremism, and can be seen as a violation of human rights and international law."

    "answer": [
      "In recent years, China's image and credibility in the region and beyond has changed significantly. On the one hand, China has become a major economic and political player in the region and beyond. Its rapid economic growth and expanding global influence have led to increased respect and recognition from other countries. China has also become an important contributor to international organizations such as the United Nations, and its initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative have been widely welcomed by many countries.",
      "On the other hand, China's increasing assertiveness in the region and its human rights record have raised concerns among some countries. China's territorial disputes with its neighbors in the South China Sea have led to tensions and conflicts, and its treatment of ethnic and religious minorities has been criticized by human rights groups. China's authoritarian political system and restrictions on freedom of speech and the press have also raised concerns among some countries.",
      "In conclusion, China's image and credibility in the region and beyond has been both positive and negative in recent years. While China's economic and political influence has grown, its assertiveness in the region and human rights record have been criticized by some countries."

    "question": "1. How does climate change affect global agricultural production and food security?",
    "answer": [
      "Climate change has a significant impact on global agricultural production and food security. The changes in temperature, precipitation, and weather patterns can affect crop yields and the availability of fresh water, which are crucial for agricultural production. According to a study by the International Food Policy Research Institute, climate change is likely to reduce global crop yields by up to 25% by the year 2050, which can lead to food insecurity and increased food prices. Additionally, climate change can also cause displacement of people from their homes due to droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events, which can further exacerbate food insecurity.",
      "Moreover, the effects of climate change are not uniform across the world. Developing countries, which are already facing food insecurity, are likely to be the most affected by climate change. For example, droughts in sub-Saharan Africa can lead to food shortages and malnutrition, which can have a devastating impact on the health and well-being of the population. In contrast, developed countries have the resources and infrastructure to adapt to the effects of climate change, but they still need to take action to mitigate their greenhouse gas emissions to avoid exacerbating the problem.",
      "In conclusion, climate change poses a significant threat to global agricultural production and food security. The negative impacts of climate change can lead to food insecurity, increased food prices, and displacement of people from their homes. Developing countries are likely to be the most affected by climate change, and it is essential for all countries to take action to mitigate their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the effects of climate change."

Firstly, the US government' assistance to farmers and agribusinesses is expected to continue under the administration of Joe Biden. This will likely result in increased subsidies for US farmers and support for domestic agribusinesses, which could disadvantage foreign competitors, particularly in China. This could lead to an increase in the price of food for consumers in the US, but could also lead to an increase in the supply of food available to other countries.",
      "Secondly, the increasing competition between China and the US in the agricultural technology sector could lead to a race to the bottom in terms of environmental standards and regulations. This could result in a decrease in the quality of food produced, particularly in China, and could have negative impacts on global food security.",
      "Finally, the ongoing tech war could lead to a decrease in the ability of both countries to effectively govern their agricultural sectors. This could result in a lack of transparency in the production and distribution of food, which could have negative impacts on global food security. Overall, the ongoing China-US tech war has the potential to significantly impact global food security and governance, with potential negative consequences for both countries and the global community."

      "COMMENTARY THE United Nations Review Conference of the Non -Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 2022 did not produce a con sensus document because Russia did not agree with the texts related to the occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) in Ukraine.",
      "Such is the weight of the matter that discussions on a treaty concerning nuclear weapons non - proliferation and disarmamen t had reached a stalemate, all because of the safety of a civilian nuclear facility.",
      "Over the last year, officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) had been allowed onsite to monitor the safe operation of the Zaporizhzhia NPP.",
      "Although the agency expended enormous resources on the NPP, any compromise of its structural integrity owing to shelling by the warring forces could have resulted in a consequence far greater than the Chernobyl radioactive fallout in 1986.",
      "Even though the reactors ha d been shut down, the NPP still remained a sitting -duck in the conflict zone.",
      "The Zaporizhzhia NPP episode has highlighted how civilian NPPs can become centres of gravity during a war, and this has enormous implications for the design and reinforcement of NPPs going forward.",
      "Going Underground for Protection Nuclear reactors around the world are built above ground and housed in a fortified containment building.",
      "In the US, the Defence -In-Depth safety philosophy, which aims to prevent and mitigate accidents th rough overlapping layers of protection, ensure that such buildings have been designed to withstand the impact of an aircraft crash.",
      "In 1988, Sandia National Laboratories carried out component testing that showed a containment building withstanding the impa ct of an F -4 fighter jet crash.",
      "Following the 9/11 attack, computer simulations also concluded that containment buildings in the US can withstand the crash of a Boeing 767 commercial aircraft.",
      "However, the impact of missiles are different from that of ai r crashes.",
      "Firstly, the structural integrity of the nuclear facility would have already been weakened by artillery barrages during a battle.",
      "Furthermore, the pressure exerted on the NPP will be much greater given the higher velocity of advanced projectiles comprising sharper shaped charges.",
      "An NPP target will succumb to the penetrative and explosive effects of these missiles.",
      "Although it is a war crime to attack a nuclear facility, international instruments and laws are inadequate to prevent attacks arisin g from miscalculations.",
      "The reality, therefore, is that NPPs built above ground are vulnerable in a war, and the only way to reduce the risk of NPPs being attacked is to build the reactors underground.",
      "An underground reactor not only possesses superior p rotection in times of war, but it also has a smaller footprint, which is a huge factor in winning public acceptance.",
      "The advent of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) will also offer more flexibility for these underground reactors to be sited in or closer to cit y centres.",
      "For densely populated countries like Singapore, it will certainly be a major policy consideration to have reactors built underground \u2013 both in consideration of nuclear safety as well as physical security.",
      "Challenges in Emergency Response Building reactors underground is however a \u201cdouble -edged sword\u201d.",
      "While it offers better protection, the nature of it is such that access to the reactors would be more challenging in an emergency.",

    "question": "4. How do nuclear reactors currently built above ground protect themselves against aircraft crashes and missiles?",
    "answer": [
      "Nuclear reactors currently built above ground protect themselves against aircraft crashes and missiles through a combination of physical and technical safeguards. One of the most significant measures is the use of containment vessels, which are designed to withstand the impact of an aircraft crash or missile strike. These vessels are typically made of reinforced concrete or steel and are designed to contain any potential releases of radioactive materials.",
      "In addition to containment vessels, nuclear reactors also use other physical barriers to protect against potential threats. For example, many reactors are located in remote areas, far away from densely populated areas, which reduces the likelihood of an aircraft crash or missile strike. Additionally, many reactors are surrounded by high fences and other security measures, such as security cameras and motion detectors, to deter potential intruders.",
      "Finally, nuclear reactors also use technical safeguards to protect against aircraft crashes and missiles. For example, many reactors are equipped with radar systems that can detect potential threats and alert operators to take appropriate action. Additionally, some reactors are equipped with air deflection systems, which use fans or other means to divert incoming missiles away from the reactor.",
      "Overall, while there is always a risk of aircraft crashes and missiles targeting nuclear reactors, the physical and technical safeguards in place help to reduce this risk significantly."

    "question": "1. How does the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace, and Security relate to the issue of climate security?",
    "answer": [
      "The United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace, and Security has a direct relevance to the issue of climate security. The resolution recognizes the disproportionate impact of conflict on women and emphasizes the need to involve women in peace processes. This principle can also be applied to the context of climate change, where women are often disproportionately affected by the consequences of climate change, such as displacement, food insecurity, and health risks.",
      "Furthermore, the resolution highlights the importance of addressing gender inequality and promoting the participation of women in decision-making processes related to conflict prevention and resolution. This principle is also relevant to the issue of climate change, as gender inequality in the access to and control of resources can exacerbate the impacts of climate change.",
      "Finally, the resolution emphasizes the need to address the underlying causes of conflict, including economic and social inequality. This principle is also relevant to the issue of climate change, as the root causes of climate change, such as unsustainable economic development and resource extraction, often contribute to social and economic inequality.",
      "In conclusion, the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace, and Security provides a framework for addressing the issue of climate security by promoting gender equality, addressing the underlying causes of conflict, and promoting the participation of women in decision-making processes."

    "question": "2. What are some of the gendered implications of climate change, and how do they affect women's vulnerabilities?",
    "answer": [
      "Climate change has significant gendered implications that affect women's vulnerabilities in various ways. One of the most prominent gendered implications of climate change is the disproportionate impact on women's health and well-being. Women are often responsible for gathering water, which is essential for their families, and the depletion of groundwater due to climate change makes this task even more challenging. Moreover, women are more vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change, such as malnutrition, malaria, and waterborne diseases.",
      "Another gendered implication of climate change is the impact on women's livelihoods. Women are often more dependent on natural resources such as forests, which are being degraded by climate change. This makes it difficult for women to access resources for their livelihoods, which can lead to poverty and food insecurity. Additionally, women's roles in agriculture and food production are being threatened by climate change, which can make it difficult for them to meet their families' basic needs.",
      "Finally, climate change has gendered implications for women's rights and agency. Women are often more vulnerable to gender-based violence and discrimination, and climate change can exacerbate these issues. For example, women in areas affected by climate change may face increased pressure to leave their homes in search of resources, which can increase their risk of gender-based violence. Additionally, climate change can limit women's access to decision-making processes and resources, which can further marginalize them in their communities.",
      "Overall, the gendered implications of climate change have significant implications for women's vulnerabilities and must be taken into account in efforts to address climate change."

The RPA was developed by the Ministry of Wildlife and Sustainable Tourism in collaboration with other stakeholdcaers, including the Department of Wildlife Conservation, local government bodies, civil society organizations, and the private sector.",
      "The RPA provides a framework for implementing measures to prevent and combat wildlife poaching, including the development of a coordinated response to wildlife crime, strengthening of legal and regulatory frameworks, and the promotion of sustainable livelihoods for communities that depend on wildlife resources.",
      "One of the key contributions of the RPA is the establishment of a multi-stakeholder platform that brings together various actors to collaborate and coordinate their efforts in addressing wildlife poaching. This platform provides a platform for information sharing, coordination, and collaboration among various stakeholders, including the government, civil society organizations, and the private sector.",
      "Another important contribution of the RPA is the promotion of sustainable livelihoods for communities that depend on wildlife resources. The RPA provides support for community-based initiatives that promote alternative sources of income and promote sustainable use of wildlife resources. This helps to reduce the incentive for communities to engage in wildlife poaching and promotes the conservation of wildlife resources.",

The establishment of a multi-stakeholder platform and the promotion of sustainable livelihoods for communities that depend on wildlife resources are key contributions of the RPA that can help to address the problem of wildlife poaching and promote the conservation of wildlife resources."

However, the challenges include the ongoing transmission of the virus, the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable populations, and the potential for the virus to mutate and become more resistant to treatments.",
      "One success of the US in controlling the spread of COVID-19 has been the widespread distribution of vaccines. The government has worked closely with pharmaceutical companies to ensure that vaccines are readily available to those who need them. This has helped to significantly reduce the number of cases and deaths across the country.",
      "Another success has been the effective implementation of contact tracing. The US government has implemented a system where people who have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19 are contacted and advised to quarantine themselves. This has helped to prevent the spread of the virus.",
      "Despite these successes, there are still ongoing challenges in controlling the spread of COVID-19. The virus continues to spread, and new cases are being reported every day. This has led to a renewed push for vaccine distribution and other measures to prevent the spread of the virus. Additionally, COVID-19 has had a significant impact on vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions.",
      "Another challenge is the potential for the virus to mutate and become more resistant to treatments. This could make it more difficult to control the spread of the virus in the future. To address this, the US government has implemented measures to monitor the virus and track any changes in its behavior."

    "question": "3. What is the impact of individual freedom on the US's ability to enforce vaccination and mask-wearing during the pandemic?",
    "answer": [
      "In the United States, the impact of individual freedom on the ability to enforce vaccination and mask-wearing during the pandemic has been a contentious issue. On one hand, the government has the responsibility to protect public health and safety, which includes enforcing measures such as mandatory vaccination and mask-wearing to prevent the spread of the virus. However, individual freedom is also a fundamental right in the United States, and some argue that mandatory measures infringe upon this right.",
      "One argument against mandatory vaccination is that it violates individual rights. The right to make decisions about one's own body and health is a deeply held value in the United States, and some argue that the government should not be able to force individuals to receive a vaccine. Additionally, there are concerns about the safety and effectiveness of certain vaccines, which could further erode public trust in government-mandated vaccination programs.",
      "On the other hand, the government has a responsibility to protect public health and safety during a pandemic. Mandatory vaccination and mask-wearing are just two of the many measures that have been implemented to slow the spread of the virus and prevent serious illness or death. While some argue that these measures infringe upon individual freedom, it is important to remember that public health is a collective effort, and individuals have a responsibility to protect themselves and their communities.",
      "In conclusion, the impact of individual freedom on the US's ability to enforce vaccination and mask-wearing during the pandemic is a complex issue that requires a careful balancing of individual rights and public health concerns. While mandatory measures may be necessary to prevent the spread of the virus, it is important to do so in a way that respects individual freedom and protects the rights of all citizens."

The Trump administration's initial response to the pandemic was criticized for being slow and inadequate, leading to widespread criticism and calls for a more robust response. The administration eventually implemented a range of measures to combat the pandemic, including travel restrictions and mandatory testing, but these measures were often met with controversy and legal challenges.",
      "Politics also played a role in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, with some political leaders calling for the development of a domestic vaccine and others advocating for the use of international partnerships to expedite the development of a vaccine. The development of the vaccine was also marked by political controversy, with some politicians criticizing the government's handling of the vaccine distribution process and others calling for more stringent measures to ensure access to the vaccine for all Americans.",

The country has provided significant financial and logistical support to international efforts to combat the virus, including providing funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international organizations to purchase medical supplies and equipment. Additionally, the US has contributed a significant amount of personal protective equipment (PPE) to healthcare workers and frontline responders around the world.",
      "One of the most significant contributions made by the US has been in the development of vaccines and treatments. The US government has invested heavily in research and development efforts to create a vaccine, and the country has played a key role in the distribution of vaccines globally. The US has also made significant contributions to the development of treatments for COVID-19, including antiviral drugs and ventilators.",
      "However, the US has also faced criticism for its response to the pandemic. Some have accused the government of prioritizing the interests of the pharmaceutical industry over public health, while others have criticized the government's handling of the pandemic, including the rollout of the vaccine and the lack of resources for frontline responders. Despite these challenges, the US has remained committed to global efforts to combat COVID-19 and has continued to play a critical role in the global response."

    "question": "3. What are the potential consequences of the hawkish policy shift towards China?",

      "1. The hawkish policy shift towards China could lead to a further deterioration in the US-China relationship, potentially escalating into a full-blown trade war. This could have significant economic consequences, including higher tariffs and disruptions to global supply chains. Additionally, the increased tensions could also lead to a rise in geopolitical tensions, as the two countries compete for influence in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.",
      "2. The hawkish policy shift towards China could also have significant political consequences, particularly in the United States. The Trump administration's hardline stance on China has been widely criticized by both Democrats and Republicans, who argue that it is harming US interests and alienating key allies. If the shift continues, it could weaken support for the administration among the American public and further divide the country along partisan lines.",
      "3. Finally, the hawkish policy shift towards China could have significant implications for the global economy. The US and China are the world's two largest economies, and their relationship has a significant impact on the global trading system. If the two countries were to engage in a full-blown trade war, it could lead to a global recession and cause significant disruptions to international trade and investment flows. As such, policymakers and businesses around the world will be closely watching the US-China relationship in the coming years, and will be looking for ways to mitigate the potential risks and consequences of the hawkish policy shift towards China."

    "question": "4. What is the argument for a more dovish policy towards China?",
    "answer": [
      "The argument for a more dovish policy towards China is rooted in the belief that a more conciliatory approach towards China can lead to a more stable and peaceful relationship between the two countries. This approach involves engaging in dialogue, addressing concerns, and avoiding confrontational actions that could escalate tensions.",
      "One argument in favor of a more dovish policy towards China is that it can help to reduce the risk of conflict and increase the likelihood of cooperation. By engaging in dialogue and avoiding confrontational actions, the risk of misunderstandings and miscalculations can be reduced, leading to a more stable and peaceful relationship. This can be particularly important in the context of sensitive issues such as trade, territorial disputes, and human rights, where a more confrontational approach could exacerbate tensions and increase the risk of conflict.",
      "Another argument in favor of a more dovish policy towards China is that it can help to promote economic cooperation and growth. China is a major trading partner and investor, and a more conciliatory approach can help to promote economic ties and increase opportunities for cooperation. This can be particularly important in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, where cooperation and collaboration can be critical in addressing global challenges.",
      "Finally, a more dovish policy towards China can also help to promote regional stability and security. China's rise as a global power has led to concerns about its intentions and actions in the region. A more conciliatory approach can help to reassure allies and partners that the United States is committed to promoting stability and security in the region, and can help to reduce tensions and promote cooperation.",
      "In conclusion, a more dovish policy towards China can help to reduce the risk of conflict, promote economic cooperation and growth, and promote regional stability and security. While there are challenges and risks associated with a more conciliatory approach, the potential benefits of a more dovish policy towards China make it a compelling argument for policymakers."

      "In the Taiwan Strait, as well as in the East and South China Seas, Chinese military and quasi -military forces have repeatedly engaged in brinkmanship against the navies, coast guards and mi litary aircraft of the US and other nations.",
      "Hawkish and Dovish Options for Dealing with China The Obama, Trump and Biden administrations have responded to China\u2019s expansionist activities by adopting an increasingly hardline policy towards Beijing.",
      "Most notably, they have boosted US military deployments to the region, established new multilateral secur ity partnerships, such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (or QUAD) and AUKUS , and restricted high -technology exports to the PRC.",
      "Several foreign policy commentators have either endorsed this policy shift or lamented that it is not tough enough.",
      "The cornerst one of an even more hawkish US policy would be significantly expanded military deployments and commitments throughout the region, including the extension of a formal security guarantee to Taiwan.",
      "By contrast, some analysts have argued that a less confront ational policy towards China is preferable to avert war and address transnational threats such as climate change.",
      "The centrepiece of a more dovish policy would be the cession to China of a sphere of influence (i.e., military preponderance) over Taiwan and the South and East China Seas.",
      "Washington\u2019s Credibility Problem Unfortunately, a serious credibility problem afflicts both the hawkish and dovish approaches, which undermines their likely effectiveness.",
      "The hawkish option lacks credibility because the o utcome of China\u2019s territorial disputes matters far more to China than to the United States.",
      "For the PRC, those disputes are transpiring in adjacent geographical areas that constitute vital strategic and economic interests, and significantly impact its nati onal sovereignty.",
      "On the other hand, the United States is an ocean away, and many Americans may not view Taiwan and the South and East China Seas as vital interests.",
      "This disparity is critical because scholarly research has shown that the outcomes of crises and wars often favour the side that has more at stake in the confrontation, not the side that is more powerful.",
      "In the last half century, the US superpower has itself lost large -scale wars against far weaker but more determined adversaries in Vietnam and Afghanistan.",
      "Since Taiwan and the South and East China Seas are ultimately less important to the United States than to China, doves argue that it would be geopolitically prudent for America to cede them to China\u2019s sphere of influence.",
      "Notwithstanding the rhetorical scorn which generations of US policymakers have heaped on the concept, spheres of influence have long served as a critical tool for promoting peace between great power adversaries.",
      "Unfortunately, this option also entails a serious credibility problem for the United States.",
      "This is because granting China a sphere of influence would inevitably spark widespread alarm ab out the reliability of US commitments to the defence of its regional allies.",
      "This strategic concern would be particularly intense for two reasons.",
      "First, among the states that are contesting China\u2019s maritime claims are Japan and the Philippines, which als o happen to be lynchpins of the US alliance network in the region.",
      "Consequently, if the United States permits China to seize the contested territories, this will signal that Washington is also unwilling to oppose Chinese aggression against the Japanese and Philippine home islands.",
      "Second, although the United States is no longer formally allied to Taiwan, the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act commits Washington to provide the island with de fence assistance and to \u201cmaintain the capacity\u2026to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion [against Taiwan].\u201d Also, three of the last four presidents \u2013 Bush, Trump and Biden \u2013 have either declared or strongly insinuated that they would come to Taiwan\u2019s defence if it were to be attacked by the PRC.",
      "Given the intense bipartisan anti-China mood in US politics today, it is almost inconceivable that the Biden administration would abandon Taiwan \u2013 an economically thriving liberal democracy \u2013 to the depredations of the PRC.",
      "Averting the Worst -Case Scenarios The United States can mitigate the credibility problems associated with both the hawkish and dovish strat egies by navigating a middle course between them.",
      "Such a policy would seek to raise the costs of further Chinese expansionism in the South and East China Seas and Taiwan Strait through \u201c soft balancing \u201d, or the coordinated employment of non -military tools of coercive statecraft, including diplomatic ostracism and economic sanctions.",
      "This middle -ground policy would also enable Washington to continue providing Taiw an with robust military assistance.",
      "In recognition of the unfavourable balance of stakes for China, however, the United States would have to scrupulously refrain from direct military intervention against China in these geographic areas.",
      "Importantly, this prohibition means that the United States would not employ its military forces to defend the maritime claims of Japan and the Philippines.",
      "But it could reassure Tokyo and Manila of Washington\u2019s ironclad commitment to the security of their uncontested homela nds, however, by significantly bolstering its military presence in both countries.",
      "Although this approach would not appeal to diehard hawks or d oves, it might avoid the worst -case scenarios associated with their preferred policies.",
      "For hawks, it is that Washington stumbles into yet another exorbitant and inauspicious war of choice on the heels of Iraq and Afghanistan, though this time against a nu clear armed great power.",
      "For doves, it is that conciliatory initiatives aimed at forestalling such a war prompt disaffected US allies to bandwagon with C hina, thereby imperiling the regional balance of power."

      "To mitigate this credibility problem, it is necessary for both sides to demonstrate a commitment to diplomacy and to take concrete steps towards de-escalation, such as reducing tensions through confidence-building measures and engaging in direct negotiations.",
      "This can help to build trust and create an environment in which meaningful progress can be made towards a resolution of the crisis.",

      "One potential drawback of promoting free trade in vaccine-related and other technologies is the potential for the spread of diseases.",
      "This is because when a country allows the importation of a new vaccine or technology, it is also allowing the importation of the pathogens that the technology is designed to combat.",
      "This can lead to the spread of these pathogens to countries where they are not currently present, potentially causing outbreaks or even pandemics.",
      "Additionally, free trade agreements may not always prioritize the needs of the most vulnerable populations, leading to unequal access to life-saving technologies.",

      "COMMENTARY THE ELECTION of hardline cleric, Ebrahim Raisi, to the presidency of Iran has caused alarm in the West.",
      "It certainly poses major challenges but could also open opportunities for dealing with Iran more effectively.",
      "His rise to the top position streamlines the bifurcated authority between the unelected Supreme Leader and elected president in the Islamic Republic, as the two men will now preach from the same pulpit.",
      "Who is Ebrahim Raisi? Raisi has had a controversial past.",
      "He has been intimately associate d with the Islamic Republic since its inception in the wake of the 1978/79 Iranian revolution.",
      "That epochal event overthrew the Shah\u2019s pro -Western monarchy and enabled his chief political - religious opponent Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to establish his Isla mic order.",
      "Raisi bears the reputation of having been involved in the killing of thousands of political prisoners in 1978, which he claims was for the good of the Islamic Republic.",
      "Yet, he has also been an ardent follower of Khomeini\u2019s two -pronged appro ach to Iran\u2019s transformation: jihadi (ideological and combative) to Islamise state and society, and ijtihadi (reformative and pragmatic) to build a strong and defendable Islamic Republic, capable of resisting outside impositions and interventions.",
      "Khomei ni opposed the United States as the \u2018Great Satan\u2019 due to the superpower\u2019s past unsavoury involvement in Iran and ongoing hegemonic presence in the region.",
      "He called for resistance to the US, along with some of its regional allies (Israel in particular), no t only ideologically but also pragmatically whenever required.",
      "Instead, he urged his regime to look to the East, Soviet Russia, China and India, to counter the US, and showed no qualms over these powers\u2019 variance to his Shia Islamic disposition, despite having branded the USSR as a \u2018Lesser Satan\u2019.",
      "Reliving Khomeini\u2019s Jihadi -Ijtihadi Legacy? Khomeini died in 1989.",
      "His successor Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has followed his jihadi - ijtihadi legacy.",
      "Khamenei has used his enormous religious authority and constitut ional powers to be hardline on principles and flexible in tactics.",
      "For example, he backed the July 2015 multilateral Iran nuclear agreement \u2013 the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) \u2013 as an act of \u2018heroic flexibility\u2019 or pragmatism.",
      "Raisi embraces the same tradition.",
      "He has reached the top through the judiciary, devotion to Khomeini\u2019s concept of Velayat -e Faqih (rule of the Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist) and close links to Khamenei.",
      "Prior to running for the presidency and coming second to mo derate Hassan Rouhani in the 2017 election and then being appointed by Khamenei to the powerful position of Iran\u2019s Chief Justice, he was the custodian of the very wealthy Astan Quds Razavi Foundation (2016 -19).",
      "He was also in charge of administering Imam R eza\u2019s shrine in the city of Mashhad, where he concurrently presided over one of the best libraries and museums in Iran.",
      "As an author and researcher, I met Raisi a few years ago in Mashhad, a city of religious pilgrimage in northeast Iran.",
      "I found him to be hardline ideologically and distrustful of the US and its regional allies, but meanwhile very philosophical and engaging in discussing Iran\u2019s problems.",
      "Like Khamenei, he was sceptical of the US fully implementing the nuclear agreement.",
      "But he could also see th e need for ending the US sanctions and improving the living conditions of the Iranian people.",
      "He impressed me that, in tandem with Khamenei and many other conservative colleagues, including some in the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), he could be ijtihadi when the circumstances demanded.",
      "Hence his declaration of support as president -elect for the current Vienna negotiations to reach an agreement with the US over the JCPOA and for improving relations with regional Arab countries.",
      "Pragmatic Hardliner or Conservative Pragmatist? Raisi is unlikely to engage in any structural reforms that could rock the conservatives\u2019 hold on power or to show flexibility on Iranian national and regional security postures.",
      "But as Supreme Le ader, he is as much interested in the survival of the regime and therefore prone to pragmatic actions.",
      "A fundamental problem of the regime has been its bifurcation between the \u2018sovereignty of God\u2019, embodied in the Supreme Leader, and the \u2018sovereignty of people\u2019, reflected by the elected president.",
      "This has caused power struggles and policy confusion when someone from the ijtihadi side has been elected to the presidency, as in the case of Mohammad Khatami (1997 -2005) and the outgoing Hassan Rouhani.",
      "Raisi\u2019s election places just about all the top institutions of power under the conservatives\u2019 control, enabling them to focus on addressing domestic and foreign policy challenges without resistance from their reformist opponents.",
      "This does not provide a long -term solution to the Islamic Republic\u2019s ills but narrows the gap between the two lines of authorities for the time being."

    "question": "5. What was the approach of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini towards Iran's transformation?",
    "answer": [
      "Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's approach towards Iran's transformation was characterized by a clear vision and a determined strategy. Khomeini, who was a prominent Shia cleric, played a crucial role in Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979, which led to the overthrow of the Western-backed monarchy and the establishment of an Islamic republic.",
      "One of Khomeini's key approaches was to emphasize the importance of Islamic values and principles in governance. He believed that Iran needed to be governed according to Islamic law, or Shariah, and that the rights and duties of citizens should be based on Islamic teachings. This approach was reflected in the new constitution of Iran, which was drafted after the revolution and emphasized the role of Islam in the country's governance.",
      "Khomeini also believed in the importance of popular participation in governance. He believed that the people had a right to be involved in decision-making and that their voices should be heard. This approach was reflected in the establishment of the Islamic Consultative Assembly, or the parliament, which was given significant powers in the new constitution.",
      "Finally, Khomeini believed in the importance of international relations and the need for Iran to play a role in the Islamic world and beyond. He sought to build bridges with other Islamic countries and to promote the idea of an Islamic unity. This approach was reflected in Iran's foreign policy, which emphasized the importance of regional stability and the need for dialogue and cooperation with other countries.",
      "In conclusion, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's approach towards Iran's transformation was characterized by a clear vision and a determined strategy. He emphasized the importance of Islamic values and principles in governance, popular participation in decision-making, and international relations. These approaches were reflected in the new constitution of Iran and the country's foreign policy, and continue to shape Iran's political and social landscape to this day."

    "question": "2. To what extent do President Trump's tweets reflect his administration's policies?",
    "answer": [
      "In recent years, President Trump's tweets have become a prominent part of his communication strategy with the public. While some argue that his tweets reflect his administration's policies, others believe that they are merely a reflection of his personal views and opinions.",
      "One claim is that President Trump's tweets often align with his administration's policies. For instance, when he announced the ban on transgender individuals serving in the military, his tweet reflected the policy change that was later implemented by the Department of Defense. Similarly, his tweets on immigration have been consistent with the policies of his administration, such as the implementation of the travel ban and the increased number of immigration raids.",
      "However, another claim is that President Trump's tweets often go beyond the policies of his administration. Many of his tweets are personal in nature and reflect his personal views, such as his tweets about the Russia investigation or his attacks on the media. These tweets can be seen as a way for him to express his personal frustrations and emotions, rather than representing the official position of his administration.",
      "Furthermore, some argue that President Trump's tweets can actually hinder the implementation of his administration's policies. His tweets can create confusion and uncertainty among the public, as well as among his own cabinet members. For example, when he tweeted about the government shutdown in December 2018, it created confusion among Congress and the public about the direction of negotiations.",
      "In conclusion, while President Trump's tweets can reflect his administration's policies, it is also important to recognize that many of his tweets are personal in nature and do not necessarily represent the official position of his administration. Furthermore, his tweets can also hinder the implementation of his policies by creating confusion and uncertainty among the public and his cabinet members."

One key claim is that it has created a new level of direct communication between the President and the public, which has led to more immediate and accessible information about the administration's activities. This has also made it easier for the President to bypass traditional news outlets and communicate directly with his supporters.",
      "Another claim is that the President's use of Twitter has also made it easier for him to shape the narrative around his administration and its policies. By tweeting directly to the public, he can control the message and get his message out quickly and directly. This has made it difficult for the news media to keep up with the constant stream of tweets and to accurately report on the administration's activities.",
      "Finally, it can be argued that the President's use of Twitter has also created a new level of polarization in the media and in society. His tweets often provoke strong reactions from both supporters and critics, which has led to more partisan coverage of his administration's activities. This has made it more difficult for the news media to provide objective coverage of the administration's policies and actions."

With the rapid growth of digital technologies, ASEAN countries are expected to benefit from increased productivity, economic growth, and job creation. According to a report by McKinsey, the digital economy in Southeast Asia could contribute up to $300 billion to the region's GDP by 2025, creating millions of new jobs and boosting economic growth.",
      "One of the key drivers of this growth is the increasing adoption of digital technologies across various sectors, including e-commerce, fintech, and digital health. The growth of these sectors has led to the emergence of new businesses and startups, which are driving innovation and competition in the region. Additionally, the growth of the digital economy has also led to an increase in cross-border trade and investment, which has further contributed to the region's economic growth.",

In order to protect public health and safety, it is essential that communities are prepared to respond to potential outbreaks and emergencies.",

Communities should have access to reliable sources of information, such as public health officials and the media, in order to stay informed about potential health risks and how to respond to them. This includes being able to identify symptoms of the virus and knowing how to take appropriate precautions to prevent its spread.",

Communities should be prepared to stockpile these supplies in case of an outbreak, and individuals should be encouraged to have their own supplies at home as well.",
      "Finally, communities should also be prepared to take action in the event of an outbreak. This includes having plans in place for contact tracing, quarantine, and other measures to slow the spread of the virus. Communities should also be prepared to provide support to those who may be impacted by the outbreak, such as those who are elderly or have underlying health conditions.",

      "The trait of being highly contagious but less (yet still) lethal, has been interpreted previously as the virus\u2019 own evolutionary mechanism to adapt and raise its own probability of survival.",
      "Indeed, if COVID-19 had killed off its first victim s immediately, then after migrating from animals to man, it would have been less likel y to \u2018travel\u2019 abroad too, and situate itself in over 29 countries and a cruise ship, \u201c Diamond Princess \u201d.",
      "We do not yet know how its lethal properties may worsen in the long ru n, as there are still multiple pending cases.",
      "This trend of evolution of viruses is making diseas e diagnosis more time-consuming, almost impossible for any single country, with the global community paying the higher costs of delays in findings.",
      "For instance, it took three weeks to confirm COVID-19\u2019s human-to-human transmission (21st January), since t he time when the Chinese government reported its \u2018 mystery pneumonia-like disease \u2019 (31 December 2019).",
      "The exponential spread of the virus within China (w ith spill-overs abroad), could have been significantly slowed had earlier action been t aken.",
      "Yet, one cannot blame China, as its investment in i nfectious disease testing and monitoring far outstrips other countries, at US$1.9 4 billion, approximately triple that of the next biggest investor, Japan ($640 million), as reflected in the EIU\u2019s recent web briefing on COVID-19.",
      "Other countries today are thus more likely than not to have been caught off guard had they faced the same plight.",
      "In spite of these, Chin a still saw a preponderance of \u2018false- negatives\u2019 such that its testing accuracy was only at 30-50%.",
      "Moreover, it took three days to generate tests results in Beijing, and only seven hospitals were equipped with some genome sequencing capacity for virus diagnosis , the EIU shared.",
      "Keeping Watch: Some Lessons WHO data shows that COVID-19\u2019s spread is slowing, h aving reached the highest number of daily new, lab-confirmed cases (approx.",
      "4 ,000) on 5 February 2020; by 16 February this number had decreased to close to 1,000.",
      "Nonetheless, three key lessons can be gleaned from this experience thus far, if countries are to avoid the same plight.",

      "Global collaboration, seen today, should have begun with this, rather than in responding to the virus after it became an internat ional phenomenon.",
      "Second, inputs from the academic and scientific com munity need to be given more weight.",
      "It is one thing to have faced COVID-19, but it is quite something else to have faced it even after warnings had been given in the previous first quarter in 2019.",
      "Third, as the types of novel forms of diseases have virtually multiplied over time, with each branch of the organism giving birth to sub-bra nches of different levels of contagiousness and lethality, potentially hitting m ultiple countries at the same time, it is imperative that an equally vigilant and networked approach is taken by the international community.",
      "Going Forward: Three Lenses A networked approach to preparing for novel disease s in future would be akin to holding three types of lenses at the same time: wid e-lenses to see the full range of diseases as they occur; a microscope to investigate each one of them; and binoculars to foresee how these viruses are transforming far i nto the future.",
      "This is embodied in the Global (genome) Microbial Identifier (GMI) initiative advocated by scientists in 2011.",
      "The GMI is a \u201cglobal system to aggregate, share, mine and translate genomic data for microorganisms in real-t ime\u201d.",
      "This could provide \u2018wide- lenses\u2019 through real-time information sharing among scientists, governments and the private sector.",

      "This has prompted Japan to strengthen its national cybersecurity capabilities and cultivate cybersecurity talents, because it is cruc ial to manage any potential reputational and cyber risks and ensure to leave a positive legacy for future generations.",
      "In the Internet of Things (IoT) era, cross-sectoral collaboration is becoming more important to obtain collective knowledge and tackle with cyberattacks.",
      "That is why Japanese industry decided to form the Cross-Sector Forum to establish a good ecosystem to educate, recruit, retain, and train cy bersecurity professionals in collaboration with academia and government.",
      "In April 2015, then Senior Executive Vice President Hiromichi Shinohara of NTT, started to talk to his senior counterparts at Japan ese critical infrastructure companies to urge them to launch a forum.",
      "The Cross-Sector Forum Finally in June 2015, the forum was founded with 30 major companies from all the critical infrastructure sectors including chemical, financial, manufacturing, media, and transportation.",
      "As of today, the forum has 44 members in total.",
      "It was groundbreaking for Japanese industry to crea te a cross-sector cooperative framework on their own voluntarily to influence pol icy and share best practices rather than waiting for instructions from the government.",
      "Still, the forum members initially faced difficulti es in having frank and open discussions between different critical infrastructure sectors d ue to their different business culture before they build trust over many face-to-face meet ings and after-work drinks.",
      "The forum first had to define what cybersecurity profes sionals and their missions mean to end-user companies.",
      "Since all the members have a global business presen ce and one-fourth of them are Tokyo 2020 sponsors, the members agreed to adopt a global common language rather than a domestic one, so that they can bring back th eir findings to their subsidiaries outside Japan.",
      "Thus, the forum began looking for a global cybersec urity standard for the protection of critical infrastructure and found the National Inst itute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework.",
      "Because the Japanese Information-Technology Promoti on Agency (IPA) published a Japanese translated version in May 2014, it became easier for the Japanese forum members to understand the framework to have a holis tic picture to map what cybersecurity missions end users should pursue.",
      "NICE Framework: For In-house Cyberscurity The forum had to overcome another challenge due to their unique business culture.",
      "Under the lifetime employment system, major Japanes e companies traditionally rotate their employees every two to three years.",
      "This help s employees understand the whole picture of the company business but makes it diffic ult to maintain cybersecurity expertise and keep up with ever-growing cybersecuri ty issues.",
      "Only 28% of IT professionals work in-house in Japan, wherea s 65% do so in the US and 54% in the UK.",
      "Japanese end-user companies tend to out source most IT and cybersecurity work to system integrators and vendor s.",
      "The outsourcing culture made the forum pick another global standard, the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Frame work to define skills, which Japanese end user companies typically outsource, su ch as digital forensics to fulfill their missions.",
      "The NIST Cybersecurity Framework wa s used to map missions for in- house cybersecurity positions.",
      "The forum has published a chart to map different types of cybersecurity jobs from Chief Information Security Officer and auditors to hands-on technical people such as Security Operation Center people and Help Desk, and shows how deep technical knowledge is needed to do their job.",

      "This also allows the forum to share their learnings to adopt global stan dards and contribute to capacity- building domestically and internationally.",

    "answer": [
      "The shortage of cybersecurity professionals can be attributed to several factors, including the rapid increase in cyber threats, the growing complexity of cybersecurity, and the lack of qualified candidates.",
      "One of the main reasons for the shortage is the rapid increase in cyber threats, which has outpaced the ability of cybersecurity professionals to keep up.",
      "This has resulted in an increased demand for cybersecurity professionals, but there is a limited supply of qualified candidates.",
      "Additionally, the growing complexity of cybersecurity has made it more challenging for individuals to become cybersecurity professionals.",
      "Cybersecurity is a constantly evolving field, and it requires continuous learning and adaptation to new technologies and threats.",
      "This can be a daunting task for individuals who may not have the necessary skills or education to keep up with the latest developments.",
      "Furthermore, the lack of qualified candidates can be attributed to the low awareness of cybersecurity as a career option among young people.",
      "This can be due to a lack of understanding of the importance of cybersecurity, as well as the perception that it is a low-paying and uninteresting career.",

      "It was groundbreaking for Japanese industry to crea te a cross-sector cooperative framework on their own voluntarily to influence pol icy and share best practices rather than waiting for instructions from the government.",
      "Still, the forum members initially faced difficulti es in having frank and open discussions between different critical infrastructure sectors d ue to their different business culture before they build trust over many face-to-face meet ings and after-work drinks.",
      "The forum first had to define what cybersecurity profes sionals and their missions mean to end-user companies.",
      "Since all the members have a global business presen ce and one-fourth of them are Tokyo 2020 sponsors, the members agreed to adopt a global common language rather than a domestic one, so that they can bring back th eir findings to their subsidiaries outside Japan.",
      "Thus, the forum began looking for a global cybersec urity standard for the protection of critical infrastructure and found the National Inst itute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework.",
      "Because the Japanese Information-Technology Promoti on Agency (IPA) published a Japanese translated version in May 2014, it became easier for the Japanese forum members to understand the framework to have a holis tic picture to map what cybersecurity missions end users should pursue.",
      "NICE Framework: For In-house Cyberscurity The forum had to overcome another challenge due to their unique business culture.",
      "Under the lifetime employment system, major Japanes e companies traditionally rotate their employees every two to three years.",
      "This help s employees understand the whole picture of the company business but makes it diffic ult to maintain cybersecurity expertise and keep up with ever-growing cybersecuri ty issues.",
      "Only 28% of IT professionals work in-house in Japan, wherea s 65% do so in the US and 54% in the UK.",
      "Japanese end-user companies tend to out source most IT and cybersecurity work to system integrators and vendor s.",
      "The outsourcing culture made the forum pick another global standard, the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Frame work to define skills, which Japanese end user companies typically outsource, su ch as digital forensics to fulfill their missions.",
      "The NIST Cybersecurity Framework wa s used to map missions for in- house cybersecurity positions.",
      "The forum has published a chart to map different types of cybersecurity jobs from Chief Information Security Officer and auditors to hands-on technical people such as Security Operation Center people and Help Desk, and shows how deep technical knowledge is needed to do their job.",
      "Another chart defines what kind of skillsets are needed for so-c alled operational technology (OT) people, who specialise in industria l control systems for critical infrastructure, based on NIST 800-53 Rev.",
      "5 (draft): Security and Privacy Co ntrols for Information Systems and Organizations.",
      "NISC: For Policymakers and Educators The forum members also reached out to the Japanese government and universities to incorporate industry\u2019s efforts to cultivate cyberse curity professionals into policy- making and education.",
      "The National center of Incident readiness and Strat egy for Cybersecurity (NISC) , which is responsible to make national cybersecuri ty strategy and policy, as well as the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry invites the forum to their strategy committee meetings and ask the fo rum to share their findings.",
      "Japanese national strategies refer to the Cross-Sector Forum, introducing their definition of cybersecurity professionals.",
      "Furtherm ore, some of the forum members fund universities to create a cybersecurity course and send their employees as lecturers to share their first-hand knowledge to de tect, analyze, and response to cyberattacks.",
      "Efforts the forum makes are not just limited to Jap an.",
      "They participate in international conferences such as ones hosted by NIST to share how the Cross-Sector Forum uniquely utilizes the NIST and NICE Frameworks to d efine cybersecurity missions and professionals.",
      "Since some members have the market i n Southeast Asia, they are actively involved in cybersecurity capacity-buildin g.",
      "For example, one of the forum members provided trai n of trainers for a national Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) so that the CERT can conduct further training for local critical infrastructure companie s.",
      "Another member hosted a number of cyber exercises and incident response training f or ASEAN countries.",
      "Their journey to define cybersecurity missions and talents has helped the Cross- Sector Forum better communicate with the internatio nal cybersecurity community because they are now equipped with a global common language.",
      "This also allows the forum to share their learnings to adopt global stan dards and contribute to capacity- building domestically and internationally.",
      "Because ASEAN is now expanding its investments in c ybersecurity capacity-building, the forum\u2019s projects are topical and relevant to AS EAN countries.",

      "US$17 trillion in 2017), there are good reasons to believe that official statistics do not accurately capture activity that is taking place in this space.",
      "Existing statistical collection frameworks were dev ised and are built around an era in which trade in goods dominated, and are consequentl y not currently well-suited to measure trade in services.",

      "This is reinforced by the observation, particularly in the automotive and electronics industries, that global value chains for the produc tion of goods are becoming more regionally concentrated in order to improve proximi ty and ability to respond to market demand, and conversely tempering the drivers for gl obal trade.",
      "In contrast to the declining importance of trade in goods, McKinsey Global Institute and others (such as Deloitte Insights , Oxford Economics and the WTO ), have found that cross-border trade in services has been growin g faster than trade in goods, and/or become an increasingly significant contributor to n ational GDPs.",
      "Growing Importance of Trade in Services and Intangi bles In principle, trade in services can cover all possi ble types of services; at the WTO , it refers to a wide range of activity that includes bu siness and professional services, communication services, construction and related se rvices, distribution services, educational services, energy services, environmenta l services, financial services, health and social services, tourism services and tr ansport services.",
      "However, in trade negotiations, we would generally find exclusions when it concerns \u2018services supplied in the exercise of governmental authority\u2019 (such as social security, health, education and other such services).",
      "Although official statistics suggest that the gross value of trade in services is lower than trade in goods (approximately US$5 trillion vs.",
      "US$17 trillion in 2017), there are good reasons to believe that official statistics do not accurately capture activity that is taking place in this space.",
      "Existing statistical collection frameworks were dev ised and are built around an era in which trade in goods dominated, and are consequentl y not currently well-suited to measure trade in services.",
      "For instance, much of wh at we currently count as trade in goods embodies significant elements that we might w ish to attribute to trade in services (e.g.",
      "marketing) or other intangibles (e.g.",
      "R&D, branding).",
      "Existing statistical reporting categories also do n ot capture new types of activities that have emerged, become commercialised and grown in re cent years (e.g.",
      "cross-border provision of cloud computing services, media stream ing services).",
      "One could confidently assume that services and othe r intangibles comprise a much bigger component of cross-border trade than is curr ently measured by official trade statistics.",
      "In fact, the McKinsey Global Institute reckons that services are already worth more than goods in cross-border trade.",
      "Need to Refocus on Trade in Services Although trade in services is on the work programme of the WTO, it has been effectively neglected for a number of years.",
      "There has not been much progress beyond the General Agreement for Trade in Services , which entered into force in 1995 following the Uruguay round of trade negotiations.",
      "An attempt at cobbling together a Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) among a group of like-minded countries under the aegis of the WTO appear to have stalled since the last round of talks in November 2016.",
      "On its website , the European Commission \u2013 the European Union is a party to TiSA \u2013 stated that, \u2018n egotiations are now on hold and are expected to resume when the political context allow s.",
      "There is no formally set deadline for ending the negotiations\u2019.",
      "Given its current and prospective significance, pol icy makers and national legislators, such as those who will be attending a WTO workshop in June 2019 organised by the S.",
      "Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS ), should revisit and identify ways to promote and facilitate on-going and future trade in services and other intangibles.",
      "The immediate task for all trading economies would be to review and improve the production of statistics that capture trade in serv ices to better inform public debate and policy-making.",
      "The revised Manual on Statistics of International Trade in Serv ices adopted by the United Nations Statistical Commissio n in 2010 offers a starting point, and should be implemented by all statistical collec ting agencies.",
      "The Future is in Trade in Services The challenge would lie in balancing the need for d ata against the cost and effort of collection, as well as responding to rapid changes in contemporary economies (such as the emergence of media-streaming services).",
      "The second task is to pick up the pace in reducing existing barriers to trade, preferably on a global multilateral basis.",
      "Typical barriers to trade in services are restrictions on the establishment of foreign operations, the moveme nt of people, technical standards, certification requirements and permits, or licence requirements.",
      "Parties to TiSA should return to the negotiating ta ble.",
      "Economies that are not yet a party to TiSA should give serious consideration to participating in negotiations.",
      "Any eventual agreement would not only liberalise trade, thus potentially enhancing economic performance, but also set standards and be nchmarks for the future evolution of the global trading economy.",
      "Trade in goods still comprise a significant proport ion of global trade, but trade in services is where future, if not current, opportuni ties for significant economic growth lies.",
      "Policy makers would do well to rise above mis guided arguments that have been presented in current debates on economic nationalis m.",
      "They should focus their minds on continuing to harn ess the wider benefits of economic multilateralism by reducing barriers to trade, espe cially trade in services, in order to further grow the economic \u2018pie\u2019 from which national debates about economic distribution can take place.",

      "COMMENTARY IN THE past couple of years, discussions on AI ethi cs became the norm, with a variety of actors putting forth over 40 sets of fairly iden tical principles.",
      "These principles include: accountability, controllability, diversity , explainability, fairness, human- centricity, transparency, safety, security, and sus tainability.",
      "While this creates a shared language assisting coun tries in addressing similar concerns, the local interpretation of these princip les can differ widely, often leading to a deep sense of confusion.",
      "With the wide proliferat ion of such AI ethics principles, practitioners are getting closer to agreeing on wha t they should be in theory, but not on how to make them work in practice.",
      "Problem of Effective Implementation Principles like the ones recently published by the OECD are illustrative.",
      "They combine many existing works on AI ethics principles into an other fairly generic guideline.",
      "This level of abstraction makes it appealing enough to c reate an important international consensus.",
      "It is also, however, vague enough to allow local ac tors to interpret the principles as they see fit within their own social and cultural c ontexts.",
      "This diversity of interpretation is essential in ensuring that benefits brought to h umanity by using AI are inclusive.",
      "The problem is, therefore, one of effective impleme ntation.",
      "The problem of effective implementation is the test bed of these principles, which can often be detached from technical capabilities and h uman practices.",
      "Can these AI ethics principles be codified into technical and hu man practices? In theory, yes.",
      "The abovementioned principles benefit us.",
      "They are inte nded to keep us safe and help us all benefit from the use of AI.",
      "In practice, however, they face real-life conflict of interests such as corporate profitability, individual and collective biases and inequality, low general levels of technical literacy, the sanctification of progress, and the desire for constant convenience.",
      "Moving from Principles to Action The good news is that this problem is already being partially solved.",
      "Individuals and institutions working in the AI ethics field are mov ing from principles to action.",

      "Additions to the over 40 existing sets of AI ethics principles are a positive and welcome development if they represent new concerns and popu lation groups.",
      "But things will only change when local governments interpret and im plement them in local regulations and more institutions develop technical tools and m ethods to put them into practice.",
      "Tangible solutions are within reach.",
      "The Small Country Advantage Smaller countries have an edge in solving this prob lem.",
      "As importers of technology from larger countries, smaller ones often find them selves relying on tools not developed with their social and technical needs in mind.",

    "question": "1. How has the war between Russia and Ukraine affected global food security, particularly in Asia?",
    "answer": [
      "The war between Russia and Ukraine has had a significant impact on global food security, particularly in Asia. One claim is that the conflict has disrupted global trade routes, which has led to a shortage of certain food products, particularly in Asian countries that rely heavily on imported goods. For example, Ukraine is a major producer of wheat, corn, and other grains, and the disruption of trade routes has led to a decrease in the supply of these products, resulting in higher prices and food scarcity in countries like China and India.",
      "Another claim is that the conflict has also affected the livelihoods of millions of people, particularly in Ukraine, where the war has resulted in displacement, poverty, and malnutrition. This has led to a decrease in food production and increased demand for food assistance in the region, which has further strained global food security.",
      "Finally, the war has also resulted in the destruction of infrastructure and agricultural land, which has had a long-term impact on food production and availability. This has resulted in a decrease in the overall food supply and has had a ripple effect on global food security, particularly in countries that rely heavily on imported food products.",
      "In conclusion, the war between Russia and Ukraine has had a significant impact on global food security, particularly in Asia, by disrupting global trade routes, affecting livelihoods, and destroying infrastructure and agricultural land. These factors have resulted in a decrease in the overall food supply, leading to higher prices and food scarcity in countries that rely heavily on imported goods."

    "answer": [
      "Fertilisers play a crucial role in global food production by providing essential nutrients to crops, enhancing soil fertility, and promoting plant growth. However, the recent developments in Russia's fertiliser industry have had a significant impact on the global trade of fertilisers.",
      "Firstly, Russia's focus on increasing domestic food production has led to an increase in demand for fertilisers. This has resulted in a surge in local fertiliser production, which has reduced the country's dependence on imported fertilisers. This shift in demand has had a significant impact on the global trade of fertilisers, as Russia is a major player in the global fertiliser market.",
      "Secondly, Russia's increased production of high-quality fertilisers has also affected the global market. The country's fertiliser industry has made significant investments in research and development, resulting in the production of advanced fertilisers with improved efficiency and reduced environmental impact. These high-quality fertilisers have gained popularity in the global market, and many countries have started to adopt them.",
      "Lastly, Russia's political and economic ties with other countries have also affected the global trade of fertilisers. The country's alliances with countries such as China and Iran have resulted in increased trade and investment in the fertiliser industry. This has further strengthened Russia's position in the global fertiliser market, and has had a ripple effect on the global trade of fertilisers.",
      "In conclusion, the recent developments in Russia's fertiliser industry have had a significant impact on the global trade of fertilisers. Russia's increased focus on domestic food production, production of high-quality fertilisers, and political and economic ties with other countries have all played a role in shaping the global fertiliser market."

    "question": "5. How might the current situation in Ukraine and Russia affect the global climate change mitigation efforts, particularly in",
    "answer": [
      "The current situation in Ukraine and Russia, which includes the annexation of Crimea and the ongoing conflict in Eastern Ukraine, has significant implications for global climate change mitigation efforts. Firstly, the escalating tensions between Ukraine and Russia have resulted in a reduction in trade and economic cooperation between the two countries. This reduction in trade has had a negative impact on the global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as it has hindered the transfer of technology and knowledge necessary for mitigating climate change.",
      "Secondly, the annexation of Crimea has resulted in a loss of Ukrainian territory, which has had a negative impact on the country's ability to mitigate climate change. Ukraine has a number of natural resources, including forests and agricultural land, that are important for mitigating climate change. The loss of territory has resulted in a reduction in the amount of land available for reforestation and agricultural practices that can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "Finally, the ongoing conflict in Eastern Ukraine has resulted in a disruption of energy supplies, which has had a negative impact on the global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The conflict has resulted in a reduction in the amount of natural gas that is available for export from Russia, which has increased the price of natural gas in Europe. This increase in the price of natural gas has resulted in an increase in the use of coal and other fossil fuels, which has had a negative impact on the global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "In conclusion, the current situation in Ukraine and Russia has had a negative impact on global climate change mitigation efforts. The reduction in trade, the loss of territory, and the disruption of energy supplies have all had a negative impact on the ability of the global community to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."

      "COMMENTARY AMID GROWING tensions between the United States and China, Washington has announced a new South China Sea policy.",
      "The new policy was expressed by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on 13 July 2020 as the two powers locked horns on multiple fronts from economic and technological competition and issues over Hong Kong and Xinjiang, to the confrontation in the South China Se a.",
      "The new policy statement called out Chinese coercive actions against its Southeast Asian neighbours and promised support in protection of their respective maritime rights.",
      "The stronger US stance came after a landmark US -Japan -Australia joint statement of 7 July, condemning Chinese actions in the region.",
      "The trilateral declaration was followed by unilateral statements by Japan, Australia and India, among others, along the same tone.",
      "Why the New US Policy Pompeo\u2019s statement made the intention of the new policy crystal clear: \u201cBeijing\u2019s claims to offshore resources across most of the South China Sea are completely unlawful, as is its campaign of bullying to control them\u201d.",
      "The policy aligned the US South China Sea position closely with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the 2016 Philippines versus China international arbitration ruling, which delegitimised claims to historic rights and China\u2019s so-called nine -dashed line in the South China Sea as the basis of Beijing\u2019s claims.",
      "The statement therefore also showed Washington\u2019s strong support for the declaration made by ASEAN leaders at the end of the 36th ASEAN Summit on 26 June 2020, insisting that all maritime claims to be based on international law, and especially the UNCLOS.",
      "Not all this is new, though.",
      "Washington has consistently denounced Chinese excessive and illegal maritime claims in South China Sea, including the nine -dashed line, and has increasingly called out Chinese bullying of other South China Sea claimant states.",
      "More Explicit Tone What is different, however, is the explicit tone and message it sends to Beijing as well as allies and partners in the region that the US is doubling down on stopping China\u2019s coercive actions in the South China Sea.",
      "As a clear signal t o allies and partners, the statement singles out Chinese assertive actions in the Philippines\u2019 Scarborough Shoal, Mischief Reef, and the Second Thomas Shoal, Vietnam\u2019s Vanguard Bank, Malaysia\u2019s Luconia Shoals, and Natuna Basar off Indonesia.",
      "It calls out China\u2019s harassment of coastal states\u2019 legitimate fishing and hydrocarbon development activities around those maritime features.",
      "The policy thus gives explicit US support to those states and the exercise of their rights within their respective maritime zone s, receiving positive acknowledgments from the region.",
      "In addition, the support for claimants to exercise their legal rights in their respective exclusive economic zones gives Washington a new tone to its actions in the South China Sea, one that has more credibility than backing all US moves under the assertion to uphold the freedom of navigation in the region.",
      "The two need to go hand in hand.",
      "China\u2019s Response & What Lies Ahead China, unsurprisingly, was unhappy about the US statement and followed up with the rather usual tirade.",
      "Beijing lashed Washington on interfering in the region\u2019s issues and on unnecessarily escalating the situation.",
      "Beijing views the new statement as a significant shift in Washington\u2019s policy toward South China Sea, abandoning the s tated neutrality on sovereignty disputes.",
      "Instead, China sees the new US policy as a direct challenge to its own position and blames Washington on putting a wedge between itself and Southeast Asian claimant states.",
      "With the South China Sea policy statemen t, US created itself a more explicit policy framework for activities that would deter what Pompeo accused as attempts to create a Chinese \u201cmaritime empire\u201d in the South China Sea and support the smaller Southeast Asian coastal states\u2019 rights and freedoms i n their respective exclusive economic zones (EEZs).",
      "For the US, however, the real challenge still lies ahead.",
      "How Washington go on to implement the strongly -worded policy matters ultimately more than the statement itself.",
      "In a keynote speech to the tenth annual CSIS South China Sea conference, on 14 July 2020, the US Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs David Stilwell said that \u201call tools are on the table\u201d and hinted that there certainly was room to sanction Chine se officials and state -owned enterprises that engage in illegal activities.",
      "An example of possible US actions that will follow took place from late April till early May when Chinese Haiyang Dizhi 8 oil exploration vessel, flanked by Chinese maritime militi a and coast guard boats, intruded into Malaysia\u2019s EEZ.",
      "Ostensibly to survey the area, the Chinese vessels harassed the Petronas -operated West Capella rig\u2019s drilling operations, inviting a close monitoring by nearby US Navy warships.",
      "Following this brief s tandoff, the US Navy\u2019s littoral combat ships intermittently made themselves seen by Chinese surveillance vessels.",
      "The Navy has thus made its presence seen and felt for all sides.",
      "Whether these examples have provided a precedence for the future US Navy miss ions and involvement in disputes remains to be seen.",
      "Legitimacy and Credibility It goes without saying that while stronger US support for weaker states\u2019 maritime rights is welcomed, it also raises tension in the region.",
      "With the stronger, more muscular US Navy presence comes more frequent encounters with Chinese counterparts and, therefore, grown risk of accidents and escalation.",
      "Washington must therefore ensure that its actions, while deliberate, are both credible, controlled and legitimate, and avoid ent angling smaller states between the two behemoths navies.",
      "Ideally, US presence comes in frequent coordination with allies and partners, giving any action it takes broader legitimacy.",
      "Ultimately, legitimacy is the most critical enabler for any US action in the South China Sea and how those actions will be received and perceived by others.",
      "It is, nevertheless, a good start that the US is voicing support for the 36th ASEAN Summit chairman\u2019s statement and backing allies and partners  \u0336 such as Japan, Australi a, India  \u0336 in unilateral as well as joint statements that call out Chinese coercive actions.",
      "It is also helpful that Washington is insisting on the primacy of international rules and norms over \u201cmight makes right\u201d.",
      "Probably not in too distant future, we will see whether Washington will be willing to follow through with this bold policy statement."
    ],
    "question": "1. What is the new US policy towards the South China Sea?",
    "answer": [
      "The new US policy towards the South China Sea is one of increased military and diplomatic engagement.",
      "The US has recently increased its military presence in the region, including the deployment of additional naval vessels and aircraft.",
      "The US has also been actively involved in diplomatic efforts to address territorial disputes in the South China Sea, working with regional partners to promote freedom of navigation and overflight in the region.",

      "COMMENTARY AMID GROWING tensions between the United States and China, Washington has announced a new South China Sea policy.",
      "The new policy was expressed by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on 13 July 2020 as the two powers locked horns on multiple fronts from economic and technological competition and issues over Hong Kong and Xinjiang, to the confrontation in the South China Se a.",
      "The new policy statement called out Chinese coercive actions against its Southeast Asian neighbours and promised support in protection of their respective maritime rights.",
      "The stronger US stance came after a landmark US -Japan -Australia joint statement of 7 July, condemning Chinese actions in the region.",
      "The trilateral declaration was followed by unilateral statements by Japan, Australia and India, among others, along the same tone.",
      "Why the New US Policy Pompeo\u2019s statement made the intention of the new policy crystal clear: \u201cBeijing\u2019s claims to offshore resources across most of the South China Sea are completely unlawful, as is its campaign of bullying to control them\u201d.",
      "The policy aligned the US South China Sea position closely with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the 2016 Philippines versus China international arbitration ruling, which delegitimised claims to historic rights and China\u2019s so-called nine -dashed line in the South China Sea as the basis of Beijing\u2019s claims.",
      "The statement therefore also showed Washington\u2019s strong support for the declaration made by ASEAN leaders at the end of the 36th ASEAN Summit on 26 June 2020, insisting that all maritime claims to be based on international law, and especially the UNCLOS.",
      "Not all this is new, though.",
      "Washington has consistently denounced Chinese excessive and illegal maritime claims in South China Sea, including the nine -dashed line, and has increasingly called out Chinese bullying of other South China Sea claimant states.",
      "More Explicit Tone What is different, however, is the explicit tone and message it sends to Beijing as well as allies and partners in the region that the US is doubling down on stopping China\u2019s coercive actions in the South China Sea.",
      "As a clear signal t o allies and partners, the statement singles out Chinese assertive actions in the Philippines\u2019 Scarborough Shoal, Mischief Reef, and the Second Thomas Shoal, Vietnam\u2019s Vanguard Bank, Malaysia\u2019s Luconia Shoals, and Natuna Basar off Indonesia.",
      "It calls out China\u2019s harassment of coastal states\u2019 legitimate fishing and hydrocarbon development activities around those maritime features.",
      "The policy thus gives explicit US support to those states and the exercise of their rights within their respective maritime zone s, receiving positive acknowledgments from the region.",
      "In addition, the support for claimants to exercise their legal rights in their respective exclusive economic zones gives Washington a new tone to its actions in the South China Sea, one that has more credibility than backing all US moves under the assertion to uphold the freedom of navigation in the region.",
      "The two need to go hand in hand.",
      "China\u2019s Response & What Lies Ahead China, unsurprisingly, was unhappy about the US statement and followed up with the rather usual tirade.",
      "Beijing lashed Washington on interfering in the region\u2019s issues and on unnecessarily escalating the situation.",
      "Beijing views the new statement as a significant shift in Washington\u2019s policy toward South China Sea, abandoning the s tated neutrality on sovereignty disputes.",
      "Instead, China sees the new US policy as a direct challenge to its own position and blames Washington on putting a wedge between itself and Southeast Asian claimant states.",
      "With the South China Sea policy statemen t, US created itself a more explicit policy framework for activities that would deter what Pompeo accused as attempts to create a Chinese \u201cmaritime empire\u201d in the South China Sea and support the smaller Southeast Asian coastal states\u2019 rights and freedoms i n their respective exclusive economic zones (EEZs).",
      "For the US, however, the real challenge still lies ahead.",
      "How Washington go on to implement the strongly -worded policy matters ultimately more than the statement itself.",
      "In a keynote speech to the tenth annual CSIS South China Sea conference, on 14 July 2020, the US Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs David Stilwell said that \u201call tools are on the table\u201d and hinted that there certainly was room to sanction Chine se officials and state -owned enterprises that engage in illegal activities.",
      "An example of possible US actions that will follow took place from late April till early May when Chinese Haiyang Dizhi 8 oil exploration vessel, flanked by Chinese maritime militi a and coast guard boats, intruded into Malaysia\u2019s EEZ.",
      "Ostensibly to survey the area, the Chinese vessels harassed the Petronas -operated West Capella rig\u2019s drilling operations, inviting a close monitoring by nearby US Navy warships.",
      "Following this brief s tandoff, the US Navy\u2019s littoral combat ships intermittently made themselves seen by Chinese surveillance vessels.",
      "The Navy has thus made its presence seen and felt for all sides.",
      "Whether these examples have provided a precedence for the future US Navy miss ions and involvement in disputes remains to be seen.",
      "Legitimacy and Credibility It goes without saying that while stronger US support for weaker states\u2019 maritime rights is welcomed, it also raises tension in the region.",
      "With the stronger, more muscular US Navy presence comes more frequent encounters with Chinese counterparts and, therefore, grown risk of accidents and escalation.",
      "Washington must therefore ensure that its actions, while deliberate, are both credible, controlled and legitimate, and avoid ent angling smaller states between the two behemoths navies.",
      "Ideally, US presence comes in frequent coordination with allies and partners, giving any action it takes broader legitimacy.",
      "Ultimately, legitimacy is the most critical enabler for any US action in the South China Sea and how those actions will be received and perceived by others.",
      "It is, nevertheless, a good start that the US is voicing support for the 36th ASEAN Summit chairman\u2019s statement and backing allies and partners  \u0336 such as Japan, Australi a, India  \u0336 in unilateral as well as joint statements that call out Chinese coercive actions.",
      "It is also helpful that Washington is insisting on the primacy of international rules and norms over \u201cmight makes right\u201d.",

      "The new policy statement called out Chinese coercive actions against its Southeast Asian neighbours and promised support in protection of their respective maritime rights.",

    "question": "4. What is the difference between the new US policy and previous US stances on the South China Sea?",
    "answer": [
      "The new US policy on the South China Sea represents a significant departure from previous US stances on the region. While previous US administrations had generally adopted a policy of diplomatic engagement with China, the new US policy is characterized by a more confrontational approach.",
      "One key difference is the US's increased emphasis on military presence in the region. The new US policy involves a more assertive military posture, with the US military conducting more frequent and extensive freedom of navigation operations (FONOPs) in the South China Sea. This is in contrast to previous US administrations, which had generally avoided direct military challenges to China's territorial claims in the region.",
      "Another key difference is the US's increased focus on the economic dimension of the South China Sea issue. While previous US stances had generally downplayed the economic dimension of the issue, the new US policy places greater emphasis on the economic implications of China's territorial claims in the region. This includes a focus on promoting regional economic integration and countering China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in the region.",
      "Finally, the new US policy also represents a more confrontational approach to China's domestic political system. While previous US administrations had generally avoided criticizing China's domestic political system, the new US policy takes a more critical stance towards China's human rights record and political system. This includes a focus on promoting democracy and human rights in China, and a more vocal criticism of China's treatment of ethnic minorities and other marginalized groups.",
      "Overall, the new US policy on the South China Sea represents a significant departure from previous US stances on the region, with a more confrontational approach towards China's territorial claims, economic initiatives, and domestic political system."
