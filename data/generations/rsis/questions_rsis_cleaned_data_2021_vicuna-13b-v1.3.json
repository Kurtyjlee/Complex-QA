    "context": "COMMENTARY ON 21 MARCH 2020 Timor Leste reported its first case of COVID-19, a Dutch national arriving from Europe. Many expected the small Southeast Asian state to face a severe crisis  and  necessitate  urgent  international  assistance.  However,  the  young  nation dealt with the crisis in a diligent manner far better than some Western nations who love lecturing it on good governance. While  several  Western  nations  close  their  borders  only  after  having  reported thousands of cases, the authorities in Dili closed Timor Leste\u2019s borders a week before the first case was ever reported, allowing only nationals and foreign residents to enter. On 8 April the country imposed a total lockdown and declared a state of emergency. As  of  27  April  Timor  Leste  reported  24  confirmed  cases  and  not  a  single  fatality. Hospitals  handled  the  situation  quite  well  while  the  police,  the  military  and  the  civil protection services kept law and order and the populace calm. Rapid Growth of Health Service When Timor Leste gained its independence in May 2002 the country merely had 27 medical doctors and a few dozen nurses. Its entire medical facilities including hospitals had been destroyed by the retreating Indonesian army and militias. Timor Leste\u2019s first government  under  Prime  Minister  Mari  Alkatiri  made  health  and  education  top priorities. A national goal supported also by the country\u2019s founding president Xanana Gusmao, this unity allowed for coherent strategies to be developed. Starting in 2003 Timor Leste began to send hundreds of students for medical studies abroad,  primarily  to  Cuba,  which  has  a  strong  reputation  in  healthcare,  but  also  to Australia, China, New Zealand and the Philippines. In 2011, with Cuban assistance, the country\u2019s medical school was created. By early 2019 Timor Leste had more than 1100  medical  doctors  \u2500  a  ratio  of  one  doctor  per  1500  inhabitants.  This  is  a  ratio second only to Singapore in Southeast Asia. Despite American and, to a lesser extent, Australian pressure for Dili not to send its students  to  Cuba,  Timor  Leste  remained  firm  in  its  decision.  Hundreds  of  Cuban doctors have served in Timor Leste since 2003, giving a priceless contribution to the country\u2019s health service. While Timor Leste has on many occasions squandered hundreds of millions from its oil  revenue  in  dubious  projects,  the  massive  spending  on  thousands  of  young Timorese  abroad  for  higher  education  is  paying  off.  Over  10,000  Timorese  have graduated from universities around the world in several fields from Havana University to Harvard. This is a significant achievement for a nation of 1.2 million. This has allowed a pool of competent  and  young  technocrats  and  administrators  to  emerge.  Many  like  former prime minister and minister of health Dr Rui Maria de Araujo and Dr Sergio Lobo, have been at the forefront in responding to the pandemic. Hard Times Ahead While the young country has done a reasonable job at dealing with the pandemic, the crisis has also exposed many weaknesses. Timor Leste remains highly dependent on oil revenues. While statistics are contradictory, the most conservative put the country\u2019s dependence on oil at 75 percent of its GDP. The resulting collapse in oil prices following the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis has reduced  the  country\u2019s revenue by more  than  60  percent.  Several Timorese  leaders have  paid  lip  service  to  the  need  to  diversify  the  economy  and  very  little  has  been done.

    "context": "COMMENTARY THE ASEAN special summit in Jakarta on 24 April 2021 has concluded with a five- point  consensus  on  the  Myanmar  crisis.  It  called  for  cessation  of  violence, commencement  of  political  dialogue,  a  constructive  role  for  ASEAN  including  an opening for an ASEAN delegation, and the allowance of humanitarian assistance. At  first  glance,  analysis  of  the  Chair\u2019s  statement  showed  signs  of  division  \u2013  for instance,  a  lack  of  consensus  on  the  release  of  political  prisoners,  a  necessary precondition for dialogue to begin. Activists criticised that the statement did not go far enough, appearing to show that the summit achieved little. Yet if politics is, to quote the  German  statesman  Otto  von  Bismarck, about the  \u2018art  of  the possible\u2019, then  it  is necessary to set the outcome against a context of impossibilities, dead ends or worse, into which ASEAN did not throw itself. Difficulties with Intervention Disappointment  with  the  summit  may  be  seen  in  the  context  of  calls  for  external intervention in Myanmar. This desire to remove the Tatmadaw should be tempered by the  reality  that  this  would  be  costly,  risky,  and  no  guarantee  of  a  solution. Nevertheless, criticisms have continued about the failure to take a harder line against the junta, either through the UN or ASEAN, with neither path opening after the summit. The UN Security Council is deadlocked, where China and Russia would likely block moves  by  Western  powers.  While  some  therefore  conclude  that  the  UN  system  is broken, one should think about the scenario where a liberal intervention proceeded without other states\u2019 consent: Myanmar could well become the first proxy battleground in a new front of an emerging \u201cCold  War  2.0\u201d,  with  the  conflict  sharpening  and  possibly  accelerating  US-China confrontation.  Mainland  Southeast  Asian  states  are  not  unreasonable  to  baulk  at suggestions in this direction, given their experiences during the Cold War. At  the  regional  level,  ASEAN\u2019s  options  are  tempered  by  the  political  diversity  of  its membership and its own historical experiences. When Western powers intervened in post-colonial times, they never did so purely for the sake of democratic values, but always when there was a convergence of material interests to do so, with a barely- concealed  desire  to  secure  those  interests  in-country  for  themselves.  Iraq,  Libya, Syria, and others provide a litany of examples of long, costly, and complex crises, with the West\u2019s own role itself intrinsically linked to the continuation of those conflicts. In  each  case,  domestic  divisions  interwove  with  foreign  interests  to  amplify  the conflicts. Roll back further in time and one finds the price of intervention was to have to accept brutal military leaders for whom loyalty to their patron was the primary factor for  their  grip  on  power.  Post-colonial  states  in  Southeast  Asia  rightfully  reject  this option. One thing ASEAN has done well is ensure that cultural and ideological diversity among its members did not lead to conflict. Breaking that formula in order to \u201cfix\u201d Myanmar risks opening Pandora\u2019s Box for ASEAN member states, and this dismal conclusion unites them notwithstanding sometimes diametrically opposed political systems. Summit\u2019s High Points Within  these  constraints,  therefore,  ASEAN  has  little  room  for  manoeuvre.  Yet  it managed to accomplish several key things at the summit. First, Tatmadaw Senior General Min Aung Hlaing attended, which was uncertain even days before the summit. He chose to talk to ASEAN and virtually no one else, providing a necessary opening from which a solution must be found. Under the gaze of ASEAN leaders, he could not decline ASEAN\u2019s offer, something which he would have de facto accomplished by simply failing to show up. Second, he met UN Special Envoy on Myanmar Christine Schraner Burgener on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit. While what transpired has been kept under wraps, the mere fact of meeting would have been impossible without his arrival in Jakarta. Third,  on  ASEAN\u2019s  part,  it  presented  one  of  the  most  public  and  interventionist outcome  statements  the  regional  grouping  has  ever  delivered  to  another  member state. This represented a big step beyond ASEAN\u2019s usual practices and demonstrated their  view  of  its potential  impact  on  regional security  and  the  importance  they  have placed on resolution to the crisis. Next Steps While  critics  lambasted  the  lack  of  details,  this  is  overstated.  There  are  few  details because ASEAN is in uncharted waters, never having done such action before \u2013 itself a sign of how far ASEAN went to secure this outcome. ASEAN does not commit to things it does not believe it can do. Implementation details will be hammered out in ASEAN capitals and the ASEAN Secretariat soon. However, this is just the start of a long process.",

    "context": "COMMENTARY THE ASEAN special summit in Jakarta on 24 April 2021 has concluded with a five- point  consensus  on  the  Myanmar  crisis.  It  called  for  cessation  of  violence, commencement  of  political  dialogue,  a  constructive  role  for  ASEAN  including  an opening for an ASEAN delegation, and the allowance of humanitarian assistance. At  first  glance,  analysis  of  the  Chair\u2019s  statement  showed  signs  of  division  \u2013  for instance,  a  lack  of  consensus  on  the  release  of  political  prisoners,  a  necessary precondition for dialogue to begin. Activists criticised that the statement did not go far enough, appearing to show that the summit achieved little. Yet if politics is, to quote the  German  statesman  Otto  von  Bismarck, about the  \u2018art  of  the possible\u2019, then  it  is necessary to set the outcome against a context of impossibilities, dead ends or worse, into which ASEAN did not throw itself. Difficulties with Intervention Disappointment  with  the  summit  may  be  seen  in  the  context  of  calls  for  external intervention in Myanmar. This desire to remove the Tatmadaw should be tempered by the  reality  that  this  would  be  costly,  risky,  and  no  guarantee  of  a  solution. Nevertheless, criticisms have continued about the failure to take a harder line against the junta, either through the UN or ASEAN, with neither path opening after the summit. The UN Security Council is deadlocked, where China and Russia would likely block moves  by  Western  powers.  While  some  therefore  conclude  that  the  UN  system  is broken, one should think about the scenario where a liberal intervention proceeded without other states\u2019 consent: Myanmar could well become the first proxy battleground in a new front of an emerging \u201cCold  War  2.0\u201d,  with  the  conflict  sharpening  and  possibly  accelerating  US-China confrontation.  Mainland  Southeast  Asian  states  are  not  unreasonable  to  baulk  at suggestions in this direction, given their experiences during the Cold War. At  the  regional  level,  ASEAN\u2019s  options  are  tempered  by  the  political  diversity  of  its membership and its own historical experiences. When Western powers intervened in post-colonial times, they never did so purely for the sake of democratic values, but always when there was a convergence of material interests to do so, with a barely- concealed  desire  to  secure  those  interests  in-country  for  themselves.  Iraq,  Libya, Syria, and others provide a litany of examples of long, costly, and complex crises, with the West\u2019s own role itself intrinsically linked to the continuation of those conflicts. In  each  case,  domestic  divisions  interwove  with  foreign  interests  to  amplify  the conflicts. Roll back further in time and one finds the price of intervention was to have to accept brutal military leaders for whom loyalty to their patron was the primary factor for  their  grip  on  power.  Post-colonial  states  in  Southeast  Asia  rightfully  reject  this option. One thing ASEAN has done well is ensure that cultural and ideological diversity among its members did not lead to conflict. Breaking that formula in order to \u201cfix\u201d Myanmar risks opening Pandora\u2019s Box for ASEAN member states, and this dismal conclusion unites them notwithstanding sometimes diametrically opposed political systems. Summit\u2019s High Points Within  these  constraints,  therefore,  ASEAN  has  little  room  for  manoeuvre.  Yet  it managed to accomplish several key things at the summit. First, Tatmadaw Senior General Min Aung Hlaing attended, which was uncertain even days before the summit. He chose to talk to ASEAN and virtually no one else, providing a necessary opening from which a solution must be found. Under the gaze of ASEAN leaders, he could not decline ASEAN\u2019s offer, something which he would have de facto accomplished by simply failing to show up. Second, he met UN Special Envoy on Myanmar Christine Schraner Burgener on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit. While what transpired has been kept under wraps, the mere fact of meeting would have been impossible without his arrival in Jakarta. Third,  on  ASEAN\u2019s  part,  it  presented  one  of  the  most  public  and  interventionist outcome  statements  the  regional  grouping  has  ever  delivered  to  another  member state. This represented a big step beyond ASEAN\u2019s usual practices and demonstrated their  view  of  its potential  impact  on  regional security  and  the  importance  they  have placed on resolution to the crisis. Next Steps While  critics  lambasted  the  lack  of  details,  this  is  overstated.  There  are  few  details because ASEAN is in uncharted waters, never having done such action before \u2013 itself a sign of how far ASEAN went to secure this outcome. ASEAN does not commit to things it does not believe it can do. Implementation details will be hammered out in ASEAN capitals and the ASEAN Secretariat soon.

    "context": "COMMENTARY IN  A  twist  of  fate,  even  as  China  battles  with  COVID-19,  it  has  also  seen  the  re- emergence of another disease, the bird flu epidemic also known as H5N1, with more than 17,000 chickens culled as of the beginning of February. Yet, this sequence of events may only be the \u2018tip of the iceberg\u2019, if one considers the findings  of  the  Economist  Intelligence  Unit\u2019s  (EIU)  assessment  of  global  health capacities,  released  five  months  ago.  For  instance,  India,  the  world\u2019s  second  most populous country, had battled with the very same diseases although at a smaller scale, in recent weeks. Ill-prepared World In October 2019, the EIU Global Health Security Index had indicated that \u201c(no) single country in the world is fully prepared to handle an epidemic or pandemic\u201d. Granted, a 100% preparedness level may be hard to achieve. What is surprising, however, is how far countries are from the ideal state: the global average score is 40 out of 100, and even among the richest, high-income countries, the average score is 51.9. Worse still, this comes 15 years since the World Health Organisation (WHO) released its International Health Regulations in 2005, one of the references for the EIU\u2019s index. It  recommended  \u201cstrengthen(ing)  national  disease  surveillance,  prevention,  control and response systems\u2026 (and) public health security in travel and transport\u201d. No one can say that the global community had not been forewarned. As early as March 2019,  scholars  from  the  Wuhan  Institute  of  Virology  and  the  Chinese  Academy  of Sciences had already published, presciently. They warned: \u201cIt is highly likely that future SARS- or MERS-like coronavirus outbreaks will originate from bats, and there is an increased probability that this will occur in China.\u201d Overwhelming and Intractable What those Wuhan scholars did not anticipate then though, was that while COVID-19 would  not  be  nearly  as  deadly  as  Severe  Acute  Respiratory  Syndrome  (SARS),  it would instead be many times more contagious, closer in fact to the swine influenza, H1N1. The  trait  of  being  highly  contagious  but  less  (yet  still)  lethal,  has  been  interpreted previously  as  the  virus\u2019  own  evolutionary  mechanism  to  adapt  and  raise  its  own probability of survival. Indeed,  if  COVID-19  had  killed  off  its  first  victims  immediately,  then  after  migrating from animals to man,  it would have been less likely to \u2018travel\u2019 abroad too, and situate itself in over 29 countries and a cruise ship, \u201cDiamond Princess\u201d. We do not yet know how its lethal properties may worsen in the long run, as there are still multiple pending cases. This trend of evolution of viruses is making disease diagnosis more time-consuming, almost impossible for any single country, with the global community paying the higher costs of delays in findings. For instance, it took three weeks to confirm COVID-19\u2019s human-to-human  transmission  (21st  January),  since  the  time  when  the  Chinese government reported its \u2018mystery pneumonia-like disease\u2019 (31 December 2019). The exponential spread of the virus within China (with spill-overs abroad), could have been significantly slowed had earlier action been taken. Yet,  one  cannot  blame  China,  as  its  investment  in  infectious  disease  testing  and monitoring far outstrips other countries, at US$1.94 billion, approximately triple that of the next biggest investor, Japan ($640 million), as reflected in the EIU\u2019s recent web briefing on COVID-19. Other countries today are thus more likely than not to have been caught off guard had they faced the same plight. In spite of these, China still saw a preponderance of \u2018false- negatives\u2019 such that its testing accuracy was only at 30-50%. Moreover, it took three days to generate tests results in Beijing, and only seven hospitals were equipped with some genome sequencing capacity for virus diagnosis, the EIU shared. Keeping Watch: Some Lessons WHO  data  shows  that  COVID-19\u2019s  spread  is  slowing,  having  reached  the  highest number of daily new, lab-confirmed cases (approx. 4,000) on 5 February 2020; by 16 February this number had decreased to close to 1,000. Nonetheless,  three  key  lessons  can  be  gleaned  from  this  experience  thus  far,  if countries  are  to  avoid  the  same  plight.  First,  early  research  efforts  are  needed  in preparing for future disease outbreaks, long before wartime conditions occur; in fact, doing so can shift global action from \u2018fire-fighting\u2019 to prevention. Global  collaboration,  seen  today,  should  have  begun  with  this,  rather  than  in responding to the virus after it became an international phenomenon. Second, inputs from the  academic and scientific community need  to be  given more weight.

Yet, this sequence of events may only be the \u2018tip of the iceberg\u2019, if one considers the findings  of  the  Economist  Intelligence  Unit\u2019s  (EIU)  assessment  of  global  health capacities,  released  five  months  ago.  For  instance,  India,  the  world\u2019s  second  most populous country, had battled with the very same diseases although at a smaller scale, in recent weeks. Ill-prepared World In October 2019, the EIU Global Health Security Index had indicated that \u201c(no) single country in the world is fully prepared to handle an epidemic or pandemic\u201d. Granted, a 100% preparedness level may be hard to achieve. What is surprising, however, is how far countries are from the ideal state: the global average score is 40 out of 100, and even among the richest, high-income countries, the average score is 51.9. Worse still, this comes 15 years since the World Health Organisation (WHO) released its International Health Regulations in 2005, one of the references for the EIU\u2019s index. It  recommended  \u201cstrengthen(ing)  national  disease  surveillance,  prevention,  control and response systems\u2026 (and) public health security in travel and transport\u201d. No one can say that the global community had not been forewarned. As early as March 2019,  scholars  from  the  Wuhan  Institute  of  Virology  and  the  Chinese  Academy  of Sciences had already published, presciently. They warned: \u201cIt is highly likely that future SARS- or MERS-like coronavirus outbreaks will originate from bats, and there is an increased probability that this will occur in China.\u201d Overwhelming and Intractable What those Wuhan scholars did not anticipate then though, was that while COVID-19 would  not  be  nearly  as  deadly  as  Severe  Acute  Respiratory  Syndrome  (SARS),  it would instead be many times more contagious, closer in fact to the swine influenza, H1N1. The  trait  of  being  highly  contagious  but  less  (yet  still)  lethal,  has  been  interpreted previously  as  the  virus\u2019  own  evolutionary  mechanism  to  adapt  and  raise  its  own probability of survival. Indeed,  if  COVID-19  had  killed  off  its  first  victims  immediately,  then  after  migrating from animals to man,  it would have been less likely to \u2018travel\u2019 abroad too, and situate itself in over 29 countries and a cruise ship, \u201cDiamond Princess\u201d. We do not yet know how its lethal properties may worsen in the long run, as there are still multiple pending cases. This trend of evolution of viruses is making disease diagnosis more time-consuming, almost impossible for any single country, with the global community paying the higher costs of delays in findings. For instance, it took three weeks to confirm COVID-19\u2019s human-to-human  transmission  (21st  January),  since  the  time  when  the  Chinese government reported its \u2018mystery pneumonia-like disease\u2019 (31 December 2019). The exponential spread of the virus within China (with spill-overs abroad), could have been significantly slowed had earlier action been taken. Yet,  one  cannot  blame  China,  as  its  investment  in  infectious  disease  testing  and monitoring far outstrips other countries, at US$1.94 billion, approximately triple that of the next biggest investor, Japan ($640 million), as reflected in the EIU\u2019s recent web briefing on COVID-19. Other countries today are thus more likely than not to have been caught off guard had they faced the same plight. In spite of these, China still saw a preponderance of \u2018false- negatives\u2019 such that its testing accuracy was only at 30-50%. Moreover, it took three days to generate tests results in Beijing, and only seven hospitals were equipped with some genome sequencing capacity for virus diagnosis, the EIU shared. Keeping Watch: Some Lessons WHO  data  shows  that  COVID-19\u2019s  spread  is  slowing,  having  reached  the  highest number of daily new, lab-confirmed cases (approx. 4,000) on 5 February 2020; by 16 February this number had decreased to close to 1,000. Nonetheless,  three  key  lessons  can  be  gleaned  from  this  experience  thus  far,  if countries  are  to  avoid  the  same  plight.  First,  early  research  efforts  are  needed  in preparing for future disease outbreaks, long before wartime conditions occur; in fact, doing so can shift global action from \u2018fire-fighting\u2019 to prevention. Global  collaboration,  seen  today,  should  have  begun  with  this,  rather  than  in responding to the virus after it became an international phenomenon. Second, inputs from the  academic and scientific community need  to be  given more weight. It is one thing to have faced COVID-19, but it is quite something else to have faced it even after warnings had been given in the previous first quarter in 2019.

Keeping Watch: Some Lessons WHO  data  shows  that  COVID-19\u2019s  spread  is  slowing,  having  reached  the  highest number of daily new, lab-confirmed cases (approx. 4,000) on 5 February 2020; by 16 February this number had decreased to close to 1,000. Nonetheless,  three  key  lessons  can  be  gleaned  from  this  experience  thus  far,  if countries  are  to  avoid  the  same  plight.  First,  early  research  efforts  are  needed  in preparing for future disease outbreaks, long before wartime conditions occur; in fact, doing so can shift global action from \u2018fire-fighting\u2019 to prevention. Global  collaboration,  seen  today,  should  have  begun  with  this,  rather  than  in responding to the virus after it became an international phenomenon. Second, inputs from the  academic and scientific community need  to be  given more weight. It is one thing to have faced COVID-19, but it is quite something else to have faced it even after warnings had been given in the previous first quarter in 2019. Third, as the types of novel forms of diseases have virtually multiplied over time, with each  branch  of  the  organism  giving  birth  to  sub-branches  of  different  levels  of contagiousness and lethality, potentially hitting multiple countries at the same time, it is  imperative  that  an  equally  vigilant  and  networked  approach  is  taken  by  the international community. Going Forward: Three Lenses A  networked  approach  to  preparing  for  novel  diseases  in  future  would  be  akin  to holding three types of lenses at the same time: wide-lenses to see the full range of diseases as they occur; a microscope to investigate each one of them; and binoculars to foresee how these viruses are transforming far into the future. This is embodied in the Global (genome) Microbial Identifier (GMI) initiative advocated by  scientists  in  2011.  The  GMI  is  a  \u201cglobal  system  to  aggregate,  share,  mine  and translate  genomic  data  for  microorganisms  in  real-time\u201d.  This  could  provide  \u2018wide- lenses\u2019 through real-time information sharing among scientists, governments and the private sector.",
    "question": "5. How does the virus's evolutionary mechanism affect its contagiousness and lethality?",
    "point_form_context": "1. China is currently battling with COVID-19, but has also seen the re-emergence of the bird flu epidemic, known as H5N1.\n2. The EIU's assessment of global health capacities, released five months ago, indicates that India had also battled with the same diseases.\n3. The global average score for global health security is 40 out of 100, and even among the richest, high-income countries, the average score is 51.9.\n4. The Wuhan scholars had warned in March 2019 that future SARS- or MERS-like coronavirus outbreaks would originate from bats, and there was an increased probability that this would occur in China.\n5. COVID-19 is highly contagious but less lethal, and its evolutionary mechanism to adapt and raise its own probability of survival is making disease diagnosis more time-consuming and almost impossible for any single country."

Concerning dispute settlement, the Appellate Body has ceased to function since December 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the postponement of the bi-annual Ministerial Conference  which  could  have provided  an  opportunity  for the members to  alleviate their tensions and conflicts. Moreover, the rise of trade megadeals namely the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific  Partnership  (CPTPP)  and  Regional  Comprehensive  Economic Partnership (RCEP) tempts some observers to believe that trading blocs will eclipse WTO and become new key players advancing global trade. Enter WTO-Plus Blocs: New WTO Chief Needed Entering into force on 30 December 2018, CPTPP is an agreement among 11 parties representing 13.5 per cent of the world\u2019s goods trade. It is dubbed a \u201cWTO-Plus\u201d deal because  some  rules  governing  services  trade  and  labour  and  environmental standards are more advanced than those of the WTO\u2019s. RCEP, which was signed by 15 countries on 15 November 2020, is the world\u2019s biggest trading bloc to date. While critics contend that the pact still awaits ratification from the signatories before being activated, the fact that RCEP covers about 30 per cent of the global GDP and 30  per  cent  of  the  world\u2019s  population  signifies  its  potential  to  shape  the  future landscape of international commerce. Furthermore, the stepping down of the director-general (DG) Roberto Azev\u00eado added another  blow  to  WTO.  Such  move  has  made  the  organisation  leaderless.  Several nations see a need to elect the next chief soon. For instance, the Global Governance Group (3G) \u2013 an informal grouping of 30 nations convened by Singapore \u2013 released a statement  urging  all  WTO  parties  \u201cto  work  together  to  expeditiously  complete  the selection  and  appointment  of  a  new  WTO  director-general  in  accordance  with  the agreed rules and procedures\u201d. Why is a new DG needed? The main reason is that WTO needs a chief to help facilitate trade discussions and negotiations. Hence, the DG\u2019s influence largely emerges from the DG\u2019s soft skills. For instance, his ability to leverage on the networks of experts, businesses,  and  officials  as  well  as  ability  to  persuade  conflicting  parties  to  find  a common ground can make or break the negotiation. Also, the chief may have access to certain knowledge such as members\u2019 interests. It can  use  the  information  to  help  members  reconcile  their  different  preferences  and arrive at an agreed outcome. Additionally, presiding over some major gatherings, the DG  can  control  the  meeting\u2019s  pace,  the  framing  of  issues,  and  the  structure  of  the debates over certain matters. These elements can also determine whether the talks would ultimately succeed or fail. Challenges Facing Next DG Whoever  becomes  the  next  chief  will  have  to  use  the  above  skills  to  tackle  the following burning issues: In the areas of trade negotiation and  liberalisation, the DG should convince the members to rely on certain FTAs as a template for crafting WTO\u2019s rules.  History  teaches  us  that  such  arrangements  can  be  beneficial  to  global  trade governance. For example, some terms of the North America Free Trade Agreement (now renamed as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement) were later adopted at the WTO and hence  shaped  the  WTO\u2019s  rules  concerning  investment,  trade  in  services,  and intellectual property rights. Regarding dispute settlement, the chief should urge the members to adopt the Walker Principles  aimed  at  salvaging  the  appeal  process  by  directly  addressing  the  US\u2019 concerns. For example, the Principles ensure that facts are not subject to appeals, the Appellate Body makes the verdict within 90 days, and the entity\u2019s decision does not add to the members obligations and strip away their rights as provided by WTO. As  far  as  transparency  is  concerned,  the  new  DG  should  play  an  active  role  in collaborating  with  other  international  organisations  especially  the  United  Nations Conference  on  Trade  and  Development  (UNCTAD)  to  come  up  with  an  agreed definition of a \u201cdeveloping nation\u201d. Doing so would help address the contentious issue of special and differential treatment (SDT)  as  some  members  intentionally  self-select  their  developing  country  status  to take  advantage  of  SDT.

    "context": "COMMENTARY IN  JANUARY  2021,  Singapore\u2019s  Internal  Security  Department  (ISD)  arrested  the youngest detainee under the Internal Security Act. Described by ISD as a Protestant Christian of Indian ethnicity, the 16-year-old Secondary 4 student was found to have made  detailed  plans  and  preparations  to  conduct  terrorist  attacks  using  a  machete against Muslims at two mosques here. Despite ideological differences, such tactics are actually not new. They have also been observed  on  the  part  of  Islamist  militants  in  Indonesia.  Hence  mitigation  efforts employed against Islamist militants in other Southeast Asian countries can likewise be used in the case of far-right militants as well. Copying Western Terrorists The  Singaporean  boy  was  self-radicalised  and  was  particularly  fascinated  by  the Christchurch  White  supremacist  extremist  attacker,  Brenton  Tarrant.  He  watched Tarrant\u2019s live-stream video of the terrorist attack on the two mosques in New Zealand and later read his manifesto. Inspired by Tarrant, he planned to launch a similar attack in Singapore on 15 March 2020, marking two years since the Christchurch carnage. He  had  chosen  two  mosques  closest  to  his  home  as  targets.  The  teenager  also referred to a Triacetone Triperoxide (TATP) bomb making manual as he contemplated the  idea  of  using  bombs  in  his plan  and  intended  to  set  the  mosques  on  fire  using gasoline \u2013 mirroring Tarrant\u2019s plan. In  the  same  vein,  such  copycat  attempts  by  another  teenager  had  happened  in Indonesia as early as 2016. The 17-year-old Indonesian Ivan Ahmadi Hasugian, who supported the militant group Islamic State (IS) that was based in Syria and Iraq, was inspired by the church attack in Northern France which took place a month prior. Two terrorists stabbed a priest in the chest and slashed his throat. Copying this tactic, Ivan attacked the priest with an axe after the bomb he carried in his backpack failed to explode. Similar to the Singaporean teenager, Ivan also consulted a bomb-making manual; written by the Indonesian IS fighter in Syria Bahrun Naim. In addition, both teenagers were obsessed with their extremist idols. The Singaporean teen  planned  to  adorn  a  tactical  vest  with  right-wing  extremist  symbols affixed  to  it similar to the ones worn by Tarrant. He planned to decorate it with the Black Sun and Celtic Cross symbols. Parallel to this, Ivan also had a note \u201cI Love Baghdadi\u201d, referring to the IS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, which he placed in the backpack that he carried during the attack. Procuring Weapons Online In addition, a common approach is also seen in logistical preparations for the attack. This  includes  online  procurement  of  weapons.  The  Singaporean  teen,  like  Tarrant, planned to use an assault rifle to attack. He found a prospective seller on Telegram but later did not follow through after suspecting it was a scam when the buyer sought payment in Bitcoin. Nevertheless,  he  persisted  to  seek  other  ways  to  get  hold  of  a  firearm.  He  only withdrew  the  idea  when  he  realised  that  it  was  challenging  to  get  one  given Singapore\u2019s strict gun-control laws. Due to logistical difficulty, he decided to resort to knifing attacks. He later found his choice of machete on Carousell. Although he had not made the purchase yet, he had archived the page and intended to save up money to eventually buy it. There has in fact been a recurring trend in Indonesia with Islamist militants seeking to procure  bomb-making  ingredients  and  weapons  online.  Some  Indonesian  pro-IS militants have procured knives online such as Mulyadi and Abu Rara who conducted stabbing  attacks  in  2017  and  2019  respectively.   It  is  often  a  preferred  method  in Indonesia in order to circumvent detection from authorities. For  example,  in  2017,  Young  Farmer,  another  pro-IS  militant  who  was  previously deported  from  Singapore,  upon  returning  to  Indonesia,  managed  to  buy  hydrogen peroxide from an Indonesian e-commerce platform, Bukalapak. This took place after he failed to buy them direct from a chemical store in Bandung (West Java) as the store required him to present his identification card and a declaration for the procurement. This attack plot was foiled by the Indonesian police. In  other  instances,  militants  opt  for  offline  payments  to  avoid  any  online  traces  of financial  transactions.  Dita  Oepriarto,  the  mastermind  of  the  Surabaya  church bombings in May 2018, paid for the TATP bomb ingredients he ordered online by cash at a convenience store instead of bank transfers. This allowed him to evade detection from authorities. Mitigation Efforts Drawing lessons from the abovementioned cases, regional authorities may consider the following measures. First, as militants across ideologies may deploy similar modus operandi, each country should continue to monitor the modes of lone actor attacks by religiously-inspired extremists and far-right supremacists of all stripes, so as to keep abreast of evolving tactics. Authorities  should  also  persist  in tightening restrictions  on  possession  of  significant quantities  of  extremist  material  as  these  are  strong  indicators  of  radicalisation.  For instance, the Malaysian authorities had arrested scores of individuals who possessed IS videos, images or paraphernalia. This type of enforcement should be extended to individuals possessing far-right extremist paraphernalia.",

The  teenager  also referred to a Triacetone Triperoxide (TATP) bomb making manual as he contemplated the  idea  of  using  bombs  in  his plan  and  intended  to  set  the  mosques  on  fire  using gasoline \u2013 mirroring Tarrant\u2019s plan. In  the  same  vein,  such  copycat  attempts  by  another  teenager  had  happened  in Indonesia as early as 2016. The 17-year-old Indonesian Ivan Ahmadi Hasugian, who supported the militant group Islamic State (IS) that was based in Syria and Iraq, was inspired by the church attack in Northern France which took place a month prior. Two terrorists stabbed a priest in the chest and slashed his throat. Copying this tactic, Ivan attacked the priest with an axe after the bomb he carried in his backpack failed to explode. Similar to the Singaporean teenager, Ivan also consulted a bomb-making manual; written by the Indonesian IS fighter in Syria Bahrun Naim. In addition, both teenagers were obsessed with their extremist idols. The Singaporean teen  planned  to  adorn  a  tactical  vest  with  right-wing  extremist  symbols affixed  to  it similar to the ones worn by Tarrant. He planned to decorate it with the Black Sun and Celtic Cross symbols. Parallel to this, Ivan also had a note \u201cI Love Baghdadi\u201d, referring to the IS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, which he placed in the backpack that he carried during the attack. Procuring Weapons Online In addition, a common approach is also seen in logistical preparations for the attack. This  includes  online  procurement  of  weapons.  The  Singaporean  teen,  like  Tarrant, planned to use an assault rifle to attack. He found a prospective seller on Telegram but later did not follow through after suspecting it was a scam when the buyer sought payment in Bitcoin. Nevertheless,  he  persisted  to  seek  other  ways  to  get  hold  of  a  firearm.  He  only withdrew  the  idea  when  he  realised  that  it  was  challenging  to  get  one  given Singapore\u2019s strict gun-control laws. Due to logistical difficulty, he decided to resort to knifing attacks. He later found his choice of machete on Carousell. Although he had not made the purchase yet, he had archived the page and intended to save up money to eventually buy it. There has in fact been a recurring trend in Indonesia with Islamist militants seeking to procure  bomb-making  ingredients  and  weapons  online.  Some  Indonesian  pro-IS militants have procured knives online such as Mulyadi and Abu Rara who conducted stabbing  attacks  in  2017  and  2019  respectively.   It  is  often  a  preferred  method  in Indonesia in order to circumvent detection from authorities. For  example,  in  2017,  Young  Farmer,  another  pro-IS  militant  who  was  previously deported  from  Singapore,  upon  returning  to  Indonesia,  managed  to  buy  hydrogen peroxide from an Indonesian e-commerce platform, Bukalapak. This took place after he failed to buy them direct from a chemical store in Bandung (West Java) as the store required him to present his identification card and a declaration for the procurement. This attack plot was foiled by the Indonesian police. In  other  instances,  militants  opt  for  offline  payments  to  avoid  any  online  traces  of financial  transactions.  Dita  Oepriarto,  the  mastermind  of  the  Surabaya  church bombings in May 2018, paid for the TATP bomb ingredients he ordered online by cash at a convenience store instead of bank transfers. This allowed him to evade detection from authorities. Mitigation Efforts Drawing lessons from the abovementioned cases, regional authorities may consider the following measures. First, as militants across ideologies may deploy similar modus operandi, each country should continue to monitor the modes of lone actor attacks by religiously-inspired extremists and far-right supremacists of all stripes, so as to keep abreast of evolving tactics. Authorities  should  also  persist  in tightening restrictions  on  possession  of  significant quantities  of  extremist  material  as  these  are  strong  indicators  of  radicalisation.  For instance, the Malaysian authorities had arrested scores of individuals who possessed IS videos, images or paraphernalia. This type of enforcement should be extended to individuals possessing far-right extremist paraphernalia.",

    "context": "COMMENTARY FOOD IS an existential need for Singapore. That this has always been so was brought home to many Singaporeans when Malaysia\u2019s recent nationwide lockdown on travel massively  affected  the  vital  supplies  of  food  to  the  country  via  land.  While  the immediate  impact  has  abated,  this  has  affirmed  what  is  already  known  \u2013  that Singapore is vulnerable to supply disruptions and its citizens need to be prepared for future shocks to avoid the panic buying that was seen. Singapore\u2019s handling of the COVID-19 threat and its spread has been cited as a model for others. So can Singapore\u2019s response to managing food insecurity similarly become a model for others to replicate? The \u201cPerfect Storm\u201d In January 2020 I wrote an Opinion Piece for the South China Morning Post in which I warned of impending price spikes in food due to a convergence of events in 2019 going into 2020: the African Swine Fever epidemic; the Fall Armyworm eating up large areas of maize; the prolonged drought in Australia reducing exports like wheat; and bushfires destroying rangelands and livestock in Australia. And this was before COVID-19 became recognised as a pandemic. And before food exporting  countries  started  to  put  into  place  measures  that  restricted  people movement,  and  implicitly,  movement  of  people  needed  in  the  food  supply  chain. Production,  harvesting,  processing  and  transport  of  food  have  been  affected  in countries which saw infection spikes. Fortunately, governments like China have taken measures to ensure that the planting of new crops and growing of new animals can take place by allowing \u201cgreen channels\u201d to  deliver  inputs  like  fertiliser  and  feed  to  farming  communities,  and  Singapore  has activated alternative supply chains. Forthcoming are threats from swarms of locusts originating from Western and South Asia, and Avian flu. Also not felt as yet has been the impact of reduced food and feed shipments from the Americas to East and Southeast Asia. All these suggest that the coming months will be critical in determining if there will be more supply shocks. The Singapore Food Story Recognising  its  vulnerability  to  external  events,  Singapore  launched  its  \u201cSingapore Food Story\u201d in March 2019, which set a target to produce 30% of Singapore\u2019s nutrition needs by 2030, thereby reducing some of the vulnerability. This represents a 300% increase from the current target of 10%, and builds on the small number of technology- enabled vegetable, egg and fish farms. Since March 2019, there has been a flurry of activities by two lead agencies, namely the Singapore Food Agency and the A*STAR. This has further been accompanied by increased  activity in the  startup  community  associated  with  conventional  as  well  as novel food like \u201cclean meat\u201d and \u201cplant-based protein\u201d. All these augur well to increase the amount and quality of certain food items and also to create the capacity to develop exportable agri-food technologies. But the reality is that any ramp-up in local food production will not be immediately felt and there remains the important need to assure supplies of the other 90 % of Singapore\u2019s current food needs. Addressing the other 90% Singapore imports food from over 170 countries  as  part of its source diversification strategy. Supply disruptions from one country or group of countries in the same region may  be  counter-balanced  by  increasing  supplies  from  other  source  countries.  In principle, this is very sound. In practice, as we saw with the Malaysian lockdown, dependence on any country for a large share of any food item poses both real and perceptual threats. With about 40% of its fresh vegetables and 37% of chicken coming from Malaysia, any lockdown gives rise to the perception of shortage and leads to panic buying. It was only after high-level reassurances of adequate stock and alternative supplies, and visuals of food trucks crossing from Malaysia into Singapore, that the public was re-assured. A lesson learnt is that it may be prudent to ensure that not more than a third  of  any  food  item  comes  from  one  country,  and  that  there  are  other  countries capable of replacing the amounts of undersupply at short notice. Looking to 2030, even with the 30% target met, attention will have to continue on the other 70%, especially with regards to food which does not make sense to produce in Singapore, such as grains  which require much land (like rice) or animals  which are highly polluting to grow (like hogs). It  is  not  too  early  to  augment  the  current  diversified  sourcing  approach  with  added criteria like a country\u2019s \u201cramp-up\u201d capability to produce more, and its capacity to export under  food  emergency  situations.  In  this  respect,  countries  with  proven  regular surpluses  of  production  over  domestic  consumption  for  any  food  item  are  good candidates. Food Security & Nutrition Security With COVID-19, assuring sufficient food has to be accompanied by adequate nutrition to meet the body\u2019s needs for vitamins, minerals, etc. The longer any mobility lockdown lasts,  the  higher  the  risk  of  unbalanced  nutrition  occurring.  Also,  in  times  of  crisis, getting more community participation to deal with the crisis is important.",

    "context": "COMMENTARY FOOD IS an existential need for Singapore. That this has always been so was brought home to many Singaporeans when Malaysia\u2019s recent nationwide lockdown on travel massively  affected  the  vital  supplies  of  food  to  the  country  via  land.  While  the immediate  impact  has  abated,  this  has  affirmed  what  is  already  known  \u2013  that Singapore is vulnerable to supply disruptions and its citizens need to be prepared for future shocks to avoid the panic buying that was seen. Singapore\u2019s handling of the COVID-19 threat and its spread has been cited as a model for others. So can Singapore\u2019s response to managing food insecurity similarly become a model for others to replicate? The \u201cPerfect Storm\u201d In January 2020 I wrote an Opinion Piece for the South China Morning Post in which I warned of impending price spikes in food due to a convergence of events in 2019 going into 2020: the African Swine Fever epidemic; the Fall Armyworm eating up large areas of maize; the prolonged drought in Australia reducing exports like wheat; and bushfires destroying rangelands and livestock in Australia. And this was before COVID-19 became recognised as a pandemic. And before food exporting  countries  started  to  put  into  place  measures  that  restricted  people movement,  and  implicitly,  movement  of  people  needed  in  the  food  supply  chain. Production,  harvesting,  processing  and  transport  of  food  have  been  affected  in countries which saw infection spikes. Fortunately, governments like China have taken measures to ensure that the planting of new crops and growing of new animals can take place by allowing \u201cgreen channels\u201d to  deliver  inputs  like  fertiliser  and  feed  to  farming  communities,  and  Singapore  has activated alternative supply chains. Forthcoming are threats from swarms of locusts originating from Western and South Asia, and Avian flu. Also not felt as yet has been the impact of reduced food and feed shipments from the Americas to East and Southeast Asia. All these suggest that the coming months will be critical in determining if there will be more supply shocks. The Singapore Food Story Recognising  its  vulnerability  to  external  events,  Singapore  launched  its  \u201cSingapore Food Story\u201d in March 2019, which set a target to produce 30% of Singapore\u2019s nutrition needs by 2030, thereby reducing some of the vulnerability. This represents a 300% increase from the current target of 10%, and builds on the small number of technology- enabled vegetable, egg and fish farms. Since March 2019, there has been a flurry of activities by two lead agencies, namely the Singapore Food Agency and the A*STAR. This has further been accompanied by increased  activity in the  startup  community  associated  with  conventional  as  well  as novel food like \u201cclean meat\u201d and \u201cplant-based protein\u201d. All these augur well to increase the amount and quality of certain food items and also to create the capacity to develop exportable agri-food technologies. But the reality is that any ramp-up in local food production will not be immediately felt and there remains the important need to assure supplies of the other 90 % of Singapore\u2019s current food needs. Addressing the other 90% Singapore imports food from over 170 countries  as  part of its source diversification strategy. Supply disruptions from one country or group of countries in the same region may  be  counter-balanced  by  increasing  supplies  from  other  source  countries.  In principle, this is very sound. In practice, as we saw with the Malaysian lockdown, dependence on any country for a large share of any food item poses both real and perceptual threats. With about 40% of its fresh vegetables and 37% of chicken coming from Malaysia, any lockdown gives rise to the perception of shortage and leads to panic buying. It was only after high-level reassurances of adequate stock and alternative supplies, and visuals of food trucks crossing from Malaysia into Singapore, that the public was re-assured. A lesson learnt is that it may be prudent to ensure that not more than a third  of  any  food  item  comes  from  one  country,  and  that  there  are  other  countries capable of replacing the amounts of undersupply at short notice. Looking to 2030, even with the 30% target met, attention will have to continue on the other 70%, especially with regards to food which does not make sense to produce in Singapore, such as grains  which require much land (like rice) or animals  which are highly polluting to grow (like hogs). It  is  not  too  early  to  augment  the  current  diversified  sourcing  approach  with  added criteria like a country\u2019s \u201cramp-up\u201d capability to produce more, and its capacity to export under  food  emergency  situations.  In  this  respect,  countries  with  proven  regular surpluses  of  production  over  domestic  consumption  for  any  food  item  are  good candidates. Food Security & Nutrition Security With COVID-19, assuring sufficient food has to be accompanied by adequate nutrition to meet the body\u2019s needs for vitamins, minerals, etc. The longer any mobility lockdown lasts,  the  higher  the  risk  of  unbalanced  nutrition  occurring.  Also,  in  times  of  crisis, getting more community participation to deal with the crisis is important.",

    "context": "COMMENTARY CHINA MADE waves recently in financial circles when it trialled its Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) \u2013 a digital renminbi \u2013 across four cities in April 2020. The trial  was  expanded  when  the  People\u2019s  Bank  of  China  announced  that  the  city  of Shenzhen  will  distribute  RMB10  million  (around  S$2  million),  for  free,  in  a  lottery system to residents, which they can spend the e-renminbi in selected merchants and in their city\u2019s metro system. The lottery was oversubscribed with two million registrants vying for 50,000 digital \u2018red packets\u2019, each worth 200 Chinese yuan. The Chinese experience catalysed a wave of discussions by central banks around the world \u2013 how best to harness and implement a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), and what good will it bring to the state? It is worth bearing in mind that CBDCs are not the sole remit of nation states as regional groupings are showing keen interest as well. Regional Interests & ASEAN Digital Currency? The  European  Union,  for  example,  has  accelerated  its  efforts  into  studying  how  a digital  euro  could  be  initiated  and  public  consultations  have  taken  place  since  12 October this year. While the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) recently  introduced  a  single  currency  (the  eco),  crypto-enthusiasts  pointed  out  how this was a missed opportunity to digitalise the currency on blockchain technology. It is timely, then, for ASEAN to kickstart discussions on the possibility of a CDBC and how such an \u2018ASEAN Coin\u2019 might look like. The most obvious benefit of an ASEAN digital currency is that it would dramatically lower cross-border transactions and payments. Where a company would previously exchange  currency  to  pay  for  cross-border  goods  or  services,  an  ASEAN  digital currency  promises  to  cut  out  middleman  costs  for  currency  exchanges  and  make payments instantaneously. Plugged in with the latest developments in the sphere of \u2018decentralised finance\u2019 and \u2018smart contracts\u2019, it has the potential to be radically transformative. This would also be synergistic with existing ASEAN projects such as the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), ASEAN  Investment  Area  (AIA)  and  the  ASEAN  Connectivity  2025  roadmap.  An ASEAN Coin can certainly be catalytic to the emphasis on establishing ASEAN as a \u201csingle market and production base\u201d and having a \u201cfree and open investment regime\u201d. Second,  a  2019  Bain  report  suggests  that  seven  out  of  10  Southeast  Asians  are underbanked  or unbanked, having  \u201cno  access  to  credit  cards or have  no  long-term savings  product\u201d  or  \u201cwithout  access  to  a  basic  bank  account\u201d.  An  ASEAN  digital currency can bring financial inclusion to the millions of unbanked and underbanked ASEAN citizens and small businesses. For example, a fisherman in Indonesia could theoretically be plugged into the ASEAN financial ecosystem with a smartphone \u2013 and do business directly with other ASEAN companies and end consumers - without holding a bank account. Promoting ASEAN Financial & Political Centrality Third, an ASEAN digital currency can help the bloc preserve its financial and political centrality.  Given  the  maturity  of  the  Chinese  e-renminbi,  it  is  only  a  matter  of  time before it gets rolled out nationally. When that happens, the next natural step is to blend the e-renminbi into its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and regional diplomatic efforts. It is reported that merchants in Seoul\u2019s Myeongdong District (which sees substantial Chinese  tourists)  are  open  to  transacting  in  the  e-renminbi.  Given  that  Alipay  and WeChat are already common payment options in much of Southeast Asia, it would be rather frictionless to transit into the e-Renminbi system. In  any  event,  having  an  ASEAN  CBDC  could  bolster  the  regional  group\u2019s  financial autonomy  \u2013  ensuring  that  it does  not  have  to  rely on any major power  for financial inclusion or be overly dependent on extra-mural forces for its fintech architecture. To be  sure,  ASEAN  countries  are  already  at  various  stages  of  developing  their  own CBDCs. Singapore and Thailand\u2019s experimentations with CBDCs are at a very mature stage and  could  see  pilot  implementations  shortly.  Other  ASEAN  countries  such  as  the Philippines are considering introducing a CBDC. In that way, technical know-how and expert knowledge already exist at the ASEAN level to get things going. Vision of ASEAN Coin & Its Challenges Notwithstanding the potential for ASEAN countries to create  an ASEAN Coin, there remain  considerable  challenges  to  realising  this  vision.  First,  digital  infrastructures differ significantly. A few countries are substantially ahead of others in having robust and technically sound digital eco-systems. Singapore, for instance, ranks fourth worldwide in the global connectivity index and has a mobile penetration rate of around 150 per cent. This is far higher than Laos, which saw its mobile penetration rates reach only 54 per cent in 2017, while Internet penetration rates stood at 43 per cent in January 2020. Next, and perhaps the biggest challenge is to convince political leaders that an ASEAN digital currency do not necessarily have to entail a pooling of sovereignty nor having a  single monetary system.  An  ASEAN wide digital currency  could model itself  after Facebook\u2019s  Libra  template  \u2013  pegging  it  to  a  basket  of  ASEAN  currencies  \u2013  thus ensuring  price  stability  and  without  the  need  for  countries  to  give  up  their  national currencies. The central banks of member states must then ensure that this ASEAN coin is liquid and  easily  exchangeable  to  respective  national  currencies.  In  any  event,  previous infrastructural,  financial,  and  economic  disparities  have  not  prevented  ASEAN  from setting ambitious goals such as the realisation of an ASEAN Economic Community.

The Chinese experience catalysed a wave of discussions by central banks around the world \u2013 how best to harness and implement a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), and what good will it bring to the state? It is worth bearing in mind that CBDCs are not the sole remit of nation states as regional groupings are showing keen interest as well. Regional Interests & ASEAN Digital Currency? The  European  Union,  for  example,  has  accelerated  its  efforts  into  studying  how  a digital  euro  could  be  initiated  and  public  consultations  have  taken  place  since  12 October this year. While the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) recently  introduced  a  single  currency  (the  eco),  crypto-enthusiasts  pointed  out  how this was a missed opportunity to digitalise the currency on blockchain technology. It is timely, then, for ASEAN to kickstart discussions on the possibility of a CDBC and how such an \u2018ASEAN Coin\u2019 might look like. The most obvious benefit of an ASEAN digital currency is that it would dramatically lower cross-border transactions and payments. Where a company would previously exchange  currency  to  pay  for  cross-border  goods  or  services,  an  ASEAN  digital currency  promises  to  cut  out  middleman  costs  for  currency  exchanges  and  make payments instantaneously. Plugged in with the latest developments in the sphere of \u2018decentralised finance\u2019 and \u2018smart contracts\u2019, it has the potential to be radically transformative. This would also be synergistic with existing ASEAN projects such as the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), ASEAN  Investment  Area  (AIA)  and  the  ASEAN  Connectivity  2025  roadmap.  An ASEAN Coin can certainly be catalytic to the emphasis on establishing ASEAN as a \u201csingle market and production base\u201d and having a \u201cfree and open investment regime\u201d. Second,  a  2019  Bain  report  suggests  that  seven  out  of  10  Southeast  Asians  are underbanked  or unbanked, having  \u201cno  access  to  credit  cards or have  no  long-term savings  product\u201d  or  \u201cwithout  access  to  a  basic  bank  account\u201d.  An  ASEAN  digital currency can bring financial inclusion to the millions of unbanked and underbanked ASEAN citizens and small businesses. For example, a fisherman in Indonesia could theoretically be plugged into the ASEAN financial ecosystem with a smartphone \u2013 and do business directly with other ASEAN companies and end consumers - without holding a bank account. Promoting ASEAN Financial & Political Centrality Third, an ASEAN digital currency can help the bloc preserve its financial and political centrality.  Given  the  maturity  of  the  Chinese  e-renminbi,  it  is  only  a  matter  of  time before it gets rolled out nationally. When that happens, the next natural step is to blend the e-renminbi into its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and regional diplomatic efforts. It is reported that merchants in Seoul\u2019s Myeongdong District (which sees substantial Chinese  tourists)  are  open  to  transacting  in  the  e-renminbi.  Given  that  Alipay  and WeChat are already common payment options in much of Southeast Asia, it would be rather frictionless to transit into the e-Renminbi system. In  any  event,  having  an  ASEAN  CBDC  could  bolster  the  regional  group\u2019s  financial autonomy  \u2013  ensuring  that  it does  not  have  to  rely on any major power  for financial inclusion or be overly dependent on extra-mural forces for its fintech architecture. To be  sure,  ASEAN  countries  are  already  at  various  stages  of  developing  their  own CBDCs. Singapore and Thailand\u2019s experimentations with CBDCs are at a very mature stage and  could  see  pilot  implementations  shortly.  Other  ASEAN  countries  such  as  the Philippines are considering introducing a CBDC. In that way, technical know-how and expert knowledge already exist at the ASEAN level to get things going. Vision of ASEAN Coin & Its Challenges Notwithstanding the potential for ASEAN countries to create  an ASEAN Coin, there remain  considerable  challenges  to  realising  this  vision.  First,  digital  infrastructures differ significantly. A few countries are substantially ahead of others in having robust and technically sound digital eco-systems. Singapore, for instance, ranks fourth worldwide in the global connectivity index and has a mobile penetration rate of around 150 per cent. This is far higher than Laos, which saw its mobile penetration rates reach only 54 per cent in 2017, while Internet penetration rates stood at 43 per cent in January 2020. Next, and perhaps the biggest challenge is to convince political leaders that an ASEAN digital currency do not necessarily have to entail a pooling of sovereignty nor having a  single monetary system.  An  ASEAN wide digital currency  could model itself  after Facebook\u2019s  Libra  template  \u2013  pegging  it  to  a  basket  of  ASEAN  currencies  \u2013  thus ensuring  price  stability  and  without  the  need  for  countries  to  give  up  their  national currencies. The central banks of member states must then ensure that this ASEAN coin is liquid and  easily  exchangeable  to  respective  national  currencies.  In  any  event,  previous infrastructural,  financial,  and  economic  disparities  have  not  prevented  ASEAN  from setting ambitious goals such as the realisation of an ASEAN Economic Community. Unintended Consequences As  with  any  novel  ideas,  the  prospects  of  unintended  consequences  remain.  An ASEAN  Coin,  could,  foreseeably  throw  the  national  monetary  policies  of  ASEAN",
    "question": "3. What challenges do ASEAN countries face in implementing an ASEAN Coin, including differences in digital infrastructures and concerns about sovereignty and monetary systems?",

Described by ISD as a Protestant Christian of Indian ethnicity, the 16-year-old Secondary 4 student was found to have made  detailed  plans  and  preparations  to  conduct  terrorist  attacks  using  a  machete against Muslims at two mosques here. Despite ideological differences, such tactics are actually not new. They have also been observed  on  the  part  of  Islamist  militants  in  Indonesia.  Hence  mitigation  efforts employed against Islamist militants in other Southeast Asian countries can likewise be used in the case of far-right militants as well. Copying Western Terrorists The  Singaporean  boy  was  self-radicalised  and  was  particularly  fascinated  by  the Christchurch  White  supremacist  extremist  attacker,  Brenton  Tarrant.  He  watched Tarrant\u2019s live-stream video of the terrorist attack on the two mosques in New Zealand and later read his manifesto. Inspired by Tarrant, he planned to launch a similar attack in Singapore on 15 March 2020, marking two years since the Christchurch carnage. He  had  chosen  two  mosques  closest  to  his  home  as  targets.  The  teenager  also referred to a Triacetone Triperoxide (TATP) bomb making manual as he contemplated the  idea  of  using  bombs  in  his plan  and  intended  to  set  the  mosques  on  fire  using gasoline \u2013 mirroring Tarrant\u2019s plan. In  the  same  vein,  such  copycat  attempts  by  another  teenager  had  happened  in Indonesia as early as 2016. The 17-year-old Indonesian Ivan Ahmadi Hasugian, who supported the militant group Islamic State (IS) that was based in Syria and Iraq, was inspired by the church attack in Northern France which took place a month prior. Two terrorists stabbed a priest in the chest and slashed his throat. Copying this tactic, Ivan attacked the priest with an axe after the bomb he carried in his backpack failed to explode. Similar to the Singaporean teenager, Ivan also consulted a bomb-making manual; written by the Indonesian IS fighter in Syria Bahrun Naim. In addition, both teenagers were obsessed with their extremist idols. The Singaporean teen  planned  to  adorn  a  tactical  vest  with  right-wing  extremist  symbols affixed  to  it similar to the ones worn by Tarrant. He planned to decorate it with the Black Sun and Celtic Cross symbols. Parallel to this, Ivan also had a note \u201cI Love Baghdadi\u201d, referring to the IS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, which he placed in the backpack that he carried during the attack. Procuring Weapons Online In addition, a common approach is also seen in logistical preparations for the attack. This  includes  online  procurement  of  weapons.  The  Singaporean  teen,  like  Tarrant, planned to use an assault rifle to attack. He found a prospective seller on Telegram but later did not follow through after suspecting it was a scam when the buyer sought payment in Bitcoin. Nevertheless,  he  persisted  to  seek  other  ways  to  get  hold  of  a  firearm.  He  only withdrew  the  idea  when  he  realised  that  it  was  challenging  to  get  one  given Singapore\u2019s strict gun-control laws. Due to logistical difficulty, he decided to resort to knifing attacks. He later found his choice of machete on Carousell. Although he had not made the purchase yet, he had archived the page and intended to save up money to eventually buy it. There has in fact been a recurring trend in Indonesia with Islamist militants seeking to procure  bomb-making  ingredients  and  weapons  online.  Some  Indonesian  pro-IS militants have procured knives online such as Mulyadi and Abu Rara who conducted stabbing  attacks  in  2017  and  2019  respectively.   It  is  often  a  preferred  method  in Indonesia in order to circumvent detection from authorities. For  example,  in  2017,  Young  Farmer,  another  pro-IS  militant  who  was  previously deported  from  Singapore,  upon  returning  to  Indonesia,  managed  to  buy  hydrogen peroxide from an Indonesian e-commerce platform, Bukalapak. This took place after he failed to buy them direct from a chemical store in Bandung (West Java) as the store required him to present his identification card and a declaration for the procurement. This attack plot was foiled by the Indonesian police. In  other  instances,  militants  opt  for  offline  payments  to  avoid  any  online  traces  of financial  transactions.  Dita  Oepriarto,  the  mastermind  of  the  Surabaya  church bombings in May 2018, paid for the TATP bomb ingredients he ordered online by cash at a convenience store instead of bank transfers. This allowed him to evade detection from authorities. Mitigation Efforts Drawing lessons from the abovementioned cases, regional authorities may consider the following measures. First, as militants across ideologies may deploy similar modus operandi, each country should continue to monitor the modes of lone actor attacks by religiously-inspired extremists and far-right supremacists of all stripes, so as to keep abreast of evolving tactics. Authorities  should  also  persist  in tightening restrictions  on  possession  of  significant quantities  of  extremist  material  as  these  are  strong  indicators  of  radicalisation.  For instance, the Malaysian authorities had arrested scores of individuals who possessed IS videos, images or paraphernalia. This type of enforcement should be extended to individuals possessing far-right extremist paraphernalia.",

This took place after he failed to buy them direct from a chemical store in Bandung (West Java) as the store required him to present his identification card and a declaration for the procurement. This attack plot was foiled by the Indonesian police. In  other  instances,  militants  opt  for  offline  payments  to  avoid  any  online  traces  of financial  transactions.  Dita  Oepriarto,  the  mastermind  of  the  Surabaya  church bombings in May 2018, paid for the TATP bomb ingredients he ordered online by cash at a convenience store instead of bank transfers. This allowed him to evade detection from authorities. Mitigation Efforts Drawing lessons from the abovementioned cases, regional authorities may consider the following measures. First, as militants across ideologies may deploy similar modus operandi, each country should continue to monitor the modes of lone actor attacks by religiously-inspired extremists and far-right supremacists of all stripes, so as to keep abreast of evolving tactics. Authorities  should  also  persist  in tightening restrictions  on  possession  of  significant quantities  of  extremist  material  as  these  are  strong  indicators  of  radicalisation.  For instance, the Malaysian authorities had arrested scores of individuals who possessed IS videos, images or paraphernalia. This type of enforcement should be extended to individuals possessing far-right extremist paraphernalia.",

    "context": "COMMENTARY IN  JANUARY  2021,  Singapore\u2019s  Internal  Security  Department  (ISD)  arrested  the youngest detainee under the Internal Security Act. Described by ISD as a Protestant Christian of Indian ethnicity, the 16-year-old Secondary 4 student was found to have made  detailed  plans  and  preparations  to  conduct  terrorist  attacks  using  a  machete against Muslims at two mosques here. Despite ideological differences, such tactics are actually not new. They have also been observed  on  the  part  of  Islamist  militants  in  Indonesia.  Hence  mitigation  efforts employed against Islamist militants in other Southeast Asian countries can likewise be used in the case of far-right militants as well. Copying Western Terrorists The  Singaporean  boy  was  self-radicalised  and  was  particularly  fascinated  by  the Christchurch  White  supremacist  extremist  attacker,  Brenton  Tarrant.  He  watched Tarrant\u2019s live-stream video of the terrorist attack on the two mosques in New Zealand and later read his manifesto. Inspired by Tarrant, he planned to launch a similar attack in Singapore on 15 March 2020, marking two years since the Christchurch carnage. He  had  chosen  two  mosques  closest  to  his  home  as  targets.  The  teenager  also referred to a Triacetone Triperoxide (TATP) bomb making manual as he contemplated the  idea  of  using  bombs  in  his plan  and  intended  to  set  the  mosques  on  fire  using gasoline \u2013 mirroring Tarrant\u2019s plan. In  the  same  vein,  such  copycat  attempts  by  another  teenager  had  happened  in Indonesia as early as 2016. The 17-year-old Indonesian Ivan Ahmadi Hasugian, who supported the militant group Islamic State (IS) that was based in Syria and Iraq, was inspired by the church attack in Northern France which took place a month prior. Two terrorists stabbed a priest in the chest and slashed his throat. Copying this tactic, Ivan attacked the priest with an axe after the bomb he carried in his backpack failed to explode. Similar to the Singaporean teenager, Ivan also consulted a bomb-making manual; written by the Indonesian IS fighter in Syria Bahrun Naim. In addition, both teenagers were obsessed with their extremist idols. The Singaporean teen  planned  to  adorn  a  tactical  vest  with  right-wing  extremist  symbols affixed  to  it similar to the ones worn by Tarrant. He planned to decorate it with the Black Sun and Celtic Cross symbols. Parallel to this, Ivan also had a note \u201cI Love Baghdadi\u201d, referring to the IS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, which he placed in the backpack that he carried during the attack. Procuring Weapons Online In addition, a common approach is also seen in logistical preparations for the attack. This  includes  online  procurement  of  weapons.  The  Singaporean  teen,  like  Tarrant, planned to use an assault rifle to attack. He found a prospective seller on Telegram but later did not follow through after suspecting it was a scam when the buyer sought payment in Bitcoin. Nevertheless,  he  persisted  to  seek  other  ways  to  get  hold  of  a  firearm.  He  only withdrew  the  idea  when  he  realised  that  it  was  challenging  to  get  one  given Singapore\u2019s strict gun-control laws. Due to logistical difficulty, he decided to resort to knifing attacks. He later found his choice of machete on Carousell. Although he had not made the purchase yet, he had archived the page and intended to save up money to eventually buy it. There has in fact been a recurring trend in Indonesia with Islamist militants seeking to procure  bomb-making  ingredients  and  weapons  online.  Some  Indonesian  pro-IS militants have procured knives online such as Mulyadi and Abu Rara who conducted stabbing  attacks  in  2017  and  2019  respectively.   It  is  often  a  preferred  method  in Indonesia in order to circumvent detection from authorities. For  example,  in  2017,  Young  Farmer,  another  pro-IS  militant  who  was  previously deported  from  Singapore,  upon  returning  to  Indonesia,  managed  to  buy  hydrogen peroxide from an Indonesian e-commerce platform, Bukalapak.

    "context": "COMMENTARY LEADERLESS FOR almost a year, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) has a new director-general  from  1  March  2021.  Dr  Ngozi  Okonjo-Iweala\u2019s  appointment  has attracted considerable attention, not only because she is the first woman and the first African to head the WTO, but also because of hopes that she can reboot the troubled global trade body. How realistic are those expectations and how much difference can the new DG make? Experience suggests the answer: less than many outside observers may expect, but enough to be significant given even moderately positive external circumstances. Director or General? The basic point about the post of DG is that it has no formal power apart from heading the Secretariat. With its origins in the improvised arrangements of the GATT, the WTO has not managed to become a full-fledged international organisation on the level of its Bretton Woods sisters, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the World Bank. Member governments jealously protect the \u201cmember-driven\u201d principle and push back at any suspicion of overreach by the Secretariat or its head. In a far more favourable time  for  the  WTO,  DG  Renato  Ruggiero  (1995-99)  was  rebuffed  by  members  for attempting to call meetings that were seen as beyond his mandate. Frustration at this and similar constraints contributed to his decision not to seek a second term. Unlike the European Commission, the WTO Secretariat, and its director-general, have no power of initiative. Furthermore, all significant decisions are taken by members, on the basis of consensus. Unlike the World Bank or IMF, it does not control important financial resources or a network of representatives around the world. It is small, less than  700  people,  based  only  in  Geneva,  and  dependent  on  annual  approval  by members of its modest budget. The reality of these limits contrasts strikingly with the myth of the WTO as a powerful and unaccountable body fostered by critics and by governments eager to offload their own  responsibilities,  like  the  Trump  administration  blaming  the  WTO  for  its  China problem. Relying on DG\u2019s Soft Power Despite the post\u2019s lack of hard power or even a defined role, some past DGs have been able to exercise considerable influence by skilful use of the various forms of soft power that it potentially offers. The incumbent normally has a high public profile and access to senior political levels as well as to key global forums like the G20. This  means  that  the  DG  should  be  well  placed  to  show  the  sort  of  leadership  in defending the multilateral system that has been largely absent in its present crisis. The advocacy role extends to media involvement as well. The DG is the only person who can credibly claim to speak for the WTO as a whole, though always under the watchful eyes of member governments. The DG\u2019s convening power is also important, though it is not unlimited. It was further limited by the previous DG\u2019s renunciation of the use of the \u201cGreen Room\u201d, which had been depicted in a sinister light. It was in fact simply a process of informal consultation by the DG with ad hoc groups of members to resolve particular issues. The new DG would be well advised to make use of it again, whatever she chooses to call it. A Balancing Act The DG has to strike a careful balance between the global face of the role and the need to cultivate the Geneva WTO Ambassadors. Their reporting and advice inform government positions, and DGs who have failed to sustain good working relationships with  them  have  been  less  effective.  In  particular,  the  DG\u2019s  relationship  with  the annually elected Chair of the General Council is critical. Peter Sutherland, who oversaw the conclusion of the Uruguay Round and became the WTO\u2019s  first  DG,  described  the  role  as  that  of  a  facilitator.  The  key  prerequisite  for success in this role is trust. A  DG  who  succeeds  in  establishing  themselves  as  an  honest  broker  can  have  a crucial,  though  always  necessarily discreet,  influence  on  the  course  of negotiations and on the confidence that members have in the organisation. At critical points in past negotiations members have often turned to the DG to help find solutions and broker compromises. They need to be able to do so again. WTO\u2019s Heady Challenges The  issues  that  the  WTO  faces  now  are  fundamental  ones.  Is  it  still  possible  to negotiate  multilaterally?  The  fisheries  subsidies  and  agriculture  processes  are  not encouraging.  If  plurilateral  approaches  are  more  promising,  how  are  they  to  be reconciled with the multilateral system? India and South Africa have recently fired warning shots about their legal standing. One  immediate  issue  is  how  the  WTO  can  best  assist  recovery  from  COVID.  A potential tussle over intellectual property rights and vaccines is something the DG will have to approach more carefully than her recent statements suggest. Looking further ahead, the relationship between trade rules and climate change will also be an increasingly important focus of Dr Okonjo-Iweala\u2019s term. There is little sign that the WTO system is prepared for the challenge. WTO Reform: Much Touted, Little Understood WTO  reform  is  much  touted  but  little  understood.

Dr  Ngozi  Okonjo-Iweala\u2019s  appointment  has attracted considerable attention, not only because she is the first woman and the first African to head the WTO, but also because of hopes that she can reboot the troubled global trade body. How realistic are those expectations and how much difference can the new DG make? Experience suggests the answer: less than many outside observers may expect, but enough to be significant given even moderately positive external circumstances. Director or General? The basic point about the post of DG is that it has no formal power apart from heading the Secretariat. With its origins in the improvised arrangements of the GATT, the WTO has not managed to become a full-fledged international organisation on the level of its Bretton Woods sisters, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the World Bank. Member governments jealously protect the \u201cmember-driven\u201d principle and push back at any suspicion of overreach by the Secretariat or its head. In a far more favourable time  for  the  WTO,  DG  Renato  Ruggiero  (1995-99)  was  rebuffed  by  members  for attempting to call meetings that were seen as beyond his mandate. Frustration at this and similar constraints contributed to his decision not to seek a second term. Unlike the European Commission, the WTO Secretariat, and its director-general, have no power of initiative. Furthermore, all significant decisions are taken by members, on the basis of consensus. Unlike the World Bank or IMF, it does not control important financial resources or a network of representatives around the world. It is small, less than  700  people,  based  only  in  Geneva,  and  dependent  on  annual  approval  by members of its modest budget. The reality of these limits contrasts strikingly with the myth of the WTO as a powerful and unaccountable body fostered by critics and by governments eager to offload their own  responsibilities,  like  the  Trump  administration  blaming  the  WTO  for  its  China problem. Relying on DG\u2019s Soft Power Despite the post\u2019s lack of hard power or even a defined role, some past DGs have been able to exercise considerable influence by skilful use of the various forms of soft power that it potentially offers. The incumbent normally has a high public profile and access to senior political levels as well as to key global forums like the G20. This  means  that  the  DG  should  be  well  placed  to  show  the  sort  of  leadership  in defending the multilateral system that has been largely absent in its present crisis. The advocacy role extends to media involvement as well. The DG is the only person who can credibly claim to speak for the WTO as a whole, though always under the watchful eyes of member governments. The DG\u2019s convening power is also important, though it is not unlimited. It was further limited by the previous DG\u2019s renunciation of the use of the \u201cGreen Room\u201d, which had been depicted in a sinister light. It was in fact simply a process of informal consultation by the DG with ad hoc groups of members to resolve particular issues. The new DG would be well advised to make use of it again, whatever she chooses to call it. A Balancing Act The DG has to strike a careful balance between the global face of the role and the need to cultivate the Geneva WTO Ambassadors. Their reporting and advice inform government positions, and DGs who have failed to sustain good working relationships with  them  have  been  less  effective.  In  particular,  the  DG\u2019s  relationship  with  the annually elected Chair of the General Council is critical. Peter Sutherland, who oversaw the conclusion of the Uruguay Round and became the WTO\u2019s  first  DG,  described  the  role  as  that  of  a  facilitator.  The  key  prerequisite  for success in this role is trust.

    "context": "COMMENTARY BIOTECHNOLOGY CROPS have been controversial in spite of overwhelming support for  their  safety  by  the  scientific  community.  This  is  specially  so  for  the  class  of biotechnology  crops  commonly  called  \u2018GMO\u2019  or  genetically  modified  organism.  The controversy has led to public concerns about their food safety, in spite of the fact that GMOs are only approved after years of intensive testing by independent government agencies, evaluation and approval upon satisfying stringent criteria for safety. This  approval  of  Golden  Rice  and  the  lesser-known  Bt  eggplant  are  therefore milestones  in  the  use  of  biotechnology  to  meet  food  security  needs  through  more (nutritious) food with less pesticides. In the 29 countries which currently grow GMO- biotechnology crops in 2019, over 17 million farmers growing about 91 million hectares have been shown to benefit financially and health-wise. So has the environment from the  reduced  insecticide  use.  At  the  same  time,  worldwide,  beyond  the  29  growing countries, another 43 countries import GMO-biotechnology crops for food, feed and processing; this includes Singapore. Golden Rice: Addressing Vitamin A Deficiency The Philippines has a high incidence of Vitamin A Deficiency (VAD) which can lead to blindness and death, particularly among children. Rice is the staple in the Philippines, with many households consuming it two to three times a day. Almost 20 years ago, an international group tested the development of a rice variety which could provide enhanced levels of Vitamin A and  therefore relief for the many malnourished children in developing countries. This  enhanced  Beta-carotene  rice  subsequently  came  to  be  called  \u201cGolden  Rice\u201d because of the yellow hue in the grains. The development and testing of this rice has gone  through  intensive  scrutiny  by  scientific  and  regulatory  bodies  in  several countries.  Indeed  this  rice  has  been  tested  for  safety  and  environmental  concerns more than any other modern rice variety. The  World  Health  Organisation  (WHO)  estimates  that  over  half  a  million  children worldwide are affected by VAD, with disastrous impact. The International Rice Institute (IRRI) estimated that 17% of children under five in the Philippines suffer from VAD, so the Golden Rice has the potential to change the fight against this disease. Bt Eggplant: Engineered To Reduce Insecticide Use Eggplant  (a.k.a.  Aubergine) is one  of  the most  widely consumed  fruit  vegetables  in South and Southeast Asia. However, eggplant is highly susceptible to the fruit borer which severely damages the fruit that is sold through its feeding on the fleshy part of the fruit that is used by humans. To  produce  a  crop  that  is  cosmetically  acceptable  to  consumers  and  profitable  for farmers,  almost  all  eggplant  farmers  have  resorted  to  using  insecticides.  In Bangladesh, eggplant farmers have been known to spray as many as 70 times in a single  season  to  ensure  that  their  crop  is  saleable!  Oftentimes  the  pest  has  also become immune to the cocktail of insecticides used. The  alternative  technology  that  was  proposed  in  the  early  2000\u2019s  was  to  use biotechnology  to  give  resistance  to  the  fruit  borer  so  that  insecticide  use  could  be reduced, farmers could produce a crop and consumers could buy a safer vegetable. Scientists  engineered  eggplant  with  a  gene  from  a  common  soil  bacterium  called Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) and were able to show greatly increased resistance to the pest. This same bacterium in its raw form is used by organic farmers for pest control. The same Bt technology has also been successfully used in crops like maize, soybean and cotton. Indeed Bangladesh became the first country to grow this Bt eggplant in 2014 and since then some 34,000 small farmers have grown over 2,000 hectares in 2019;  farmers  have  been  less  exposed  to  dangerous  insecticides,  and  consumers have accepted this safer product. Other  countries  have  been  slow  to  adopt  this  technology  because  of  the  fear  of controversy surrounding GMO-biotechnology crops and opposition by \u201cgreen groups\u201d. And it is to the credit of Filipino scientists and regulators that they have finally accepted the scientific evidence and shown courage to approve this new eggplant variety, and give consumers a safer vegetable. Future Biotechnologies The  importance  of the  approval by  the Philippines of  Golden  Rice  and  Bt Eggplant cannot be understated. The Philippines was the first Asian country in 2000 to approve a  biotech  crop,  the  Bt  maize  for  planting  by  farmers. And  since  then  the  economic benefits to farmers, especially smallholder farmers have exceeded expectations, as studied by credible economists. It has drastically reduced the foreign exchange bill of importing maize to fuel the growing demand for animal feed. The Philippines was even able to export maize in one year. The  doomsayers  who  predicted  environmental  disaster  from  introducing  a  biotech crop  like  Bt  maize  into  the  environment  have  been  proven  wrong  as  the  fears  of upsetting biodiversity have not been evidenced. Neither has any of the concerns about animal and human safety been seen. Indeed the 20 years of biotech maize use around the world has only seen a yearly increase in the uptake by farmers, to the benefit of consumers through a reliable supply of an important animal feed (and human food in some countries). Moving Forward The latest report on food insecurity by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in 2021 (http://www.fao.org/3/cb4474en/online/cb4474en.html) shows that the Asian continent is still rife with hunger and malnutrition. Many tools are needed to address the food needs in Asia, and the approvals by the Philippines last week augur well for the application of various biotechnologies to meet the challenges of producing more of both traditional food as well as novel food.",
    "question": "1. What are the potential benefits of biotechnology crops, such as Golden Rice and Bt Eggplant, in addressing food security needs and reducing pesticide use?",
    "point_form_context": "1. Golden Rice and Bt Eggplant are two biotechnology crops that have been approved by the Philippines.\n2.

The approval of these crops by the Philippines is a milestone in the use of biotechnology to meet food security needs through more nutritious food with less pesticides.\n5. The approval of these crops is important as it shows that scientific evidence can be used to approve new crop varieties, which can benefit farmers, consumers, and the environment."

Indeed Bangladesh became the first country to grow this Bt eggplant in 2014 and since then some 34,000 small farmers have grown over 2,000 hectares in 2019;  farmers  have  been  less  exposed  to  dangerous  insecticides,  and  consumers have accepted this safer product. Other  countries  have  been  slow  to  adopt  this  technology  because  of  the  fear  of controversy surrounding GMO-biotechnology crops and opposition by \u201cgreen groups\u201d. And it is to the credit of Filipino scientists and regulators that they have finally accepted the scientific evidence and shown courage to approve this new eggplant variety, and give consumers a safer vegetable. Future Biotechnologies The  importance  of the  approval by  the Philippines of  Golden  Rice  and  Bt Eggplant cannot be understated. The Philippines was the first Asian country in 2000 to approve a  biotech  crop,  the  Bt  maize  for  planting  by  farmers. And  since  then  the  economic benefits to farmers, especially smallholder farmers have exceeded expectations, as studied by credible economists. It has drastically reduced the foreign exchange bill of importing maize to fuel the growing demand for animal feed. The Philippines was even able to export maize in one year. The  doomsayers  who  predicted  environmental  disaster  from  introducing  a  biotech crop  like  Bt  maize  into  the  environment  have  been  proven  wrong  as  the  fears  of upsetting biodiversity have not been evidenced. Neither has any of the concerns about animal and human safety been seen. Indeed the 20 years of biotech maize use around the world has only seen a yearly increase in the uptake by farmers, to the benefit of consumers through a reliable supply of an important animal feed (and human food in some countries). Moving Forward The latest report on food insecurity by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in 2021 (http://www.fao.org/3/cb4474en/online/cb4474en.html) shows that the Asian continent is still rife with hunger and malnutrition.

    "context": "COMMENTARY BIOTECHNOLOGY CROPS have been controversial in spite of overwhelming support for  their  safety  by  the  scientific  community.  This  is  specially  so  for  the  class  of biotechnology  crops  commonly  called  \u2018GMO\u2019  or  genetically  modified  organism.  The controversy has led to public concerns about their food safety, in spite of the fact that GMOs are only approved after years of intensive testing by independent government agencies, evaluation and approval upon satisfying stringent criteria for safety. This  approval  of  Golden  Rice  and  the  lesser-known  Bt  eggplant  are  therefore milestones  in  the  use  of  biotechnology  to  meet  food  security  needs  through  more (nutritious) food with less pesticides. In the 29 countries which currently grow GMO- biotechnology crops in 2019, over 17 million farmers growing about 91 million hectares have been shown to benefit financially and health-wise. So has the environment from the  reduced  insecticide  use.  At  the  same  time,  worldwide,  beyond  the  29  growing countries, another 43 countries import GMO-biotechnology crops for food, feed and processing; this includes Singapore. Golden Rice: Addressing Vitamin A Deficiency The Philippines has a high incidence of Vitamin A Deficiency (VAD) which can lead to blindness and death, particularly among children. Rice is the staple in the Philippines, with many households consuming it two to three times a day. Almost 20 years ago, an international group tested the development of a rice variety which could provide enhanced levels of Vitamin A and  therefore relief for the many malnourished children in developing countries. This  enhanced  Beta-carotene  rice  subsequently  came  to  be  called  \u201cGolden  Rice\u201d because of the yellow hue in the grains. The development and testing of this rice has gone  through  intensive  scrutiny  by  scientific  and  regulatory  bodies  in  several countries.  Indeed  this  rice  has  been  tested  for  safety  and  environmental  concerns more than any other modern rice variety. The  World  Health  Organisation  (WHO)  estimates  that  over  half  a  million  children worldwide are affected by VAD, with disastrous impact. The International Rice Institute (IRRI) estimated that 17% of children under five in the Philippines suffer from VAD, so the Golden Rice has the potential to change the fight against this disease. Bt Eggplant: Engineered To Reduce Insecticide Use Eggplant  (a.k.a.  Aubergine) is one  of  the most  widely consumed  fruit  vegetables  in South and Southeast Asia. However, eggplant is highly susceptible to the fruit borer which severely damages the fruit that is sold through its feeding on the fleshy part of the fruit that is used by humans. To  produce  a  crop  that  is  cosmetically  acceptable  to  consumers  and  profitable  for farmers,  almost  all  eggplant  farmers  have  resorted  to  using  insecticides.  In Bangladesh, eggplant farmers have been known to spray as many as 70 times in a single  season  to  ensure  that  their  crop  is  saleable!  Oftentimes  the  pest  has  also become immune to the cocktail of insecticides used. The  alternative  technology  that  was  proposed  in  the  early  2000\u2019s  was  to  use biotechnology  to  give  resistance  to  the  fruit  borer  so  that  insecticide  use  could  be reduced, farmers could produce a crop and consumers could buy a safer vegetable. Scientists  engineered  eggplant  with  a  gene  from  a  common  soil  bacterium  called Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) and were able to show greatly increased resistance to the pest. This same bacterium in its raw form is used by organic farmers for pest control. The same Bt technology has also been successfully used in crops like maize, soybean and cotton. Indeed Bangladesh became the first country to grow this Bt eggplant in 2014 and since then some 34,000 small farmers have grown over 2,000 hectares in 2019;  farmers  have  been  less  exposed  to  dangerous  insecticides,  and  consumers have accepted this safer product.

    "context": "COMMENTARY DISASTERS  ARE  becoming  increasingly  intense  and  uncertain  in  our  new  climate reality. The growing linkages between natural and human-induced hazards in a more interconnected  world  are  generating  greater  risks  that  can  overwhelm  national capacities  and  worsen  transboundary  effects.  ASEAN  states  continue  to  invest  in building  national  and  regional  emergency  and  disaster  risk  management  (DRM) systems to adapt to this. Despite  stronger  civilian  coping  mechanisms,  militaries  continue  to  be  the  primary responders of ASEAN  states during  crises  and  calamities.  Defence  forces  are  also among  the  first  to  be  mobilised  when  governments  send  or  receive  humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR). We observe this in the 2017 Marawi  conflict, the 2018 Central Sulawesi tsunami, and the current COVID-19 pandemic. Centrality of Southeast Asian Militaries The  centrality  of  Southeast  Asian  militaries  therefore  means  that  efforts  to  improve regional crisis response and disaster governance cannot fully succeed without military cooperation.  Cooperating  with  militaries, in  policy  or  practice,  requires  an understanding of the social networks they are part of and the nature of their ties in emergency and disaster contexts. Yet there is a shortage of studies outside of military institutions that generate such insights. Where should we begin? What civilians generally know about militaries in emergencies and disasters are driven by  two  developments:  technological  advancements  and  growing  acceptance  of military engagement in response to natural hazards and human-induced disasters like conflicts  to  pandemics.  Access  to  more  powerful  mobile  devices  and  information sharing platforms make large amounts of emergency and DRM data more available to the public. Datasets can give us a clearer picture not only of who is doing what, but also where and when they are doing it. As a result, our ways of tracking and assessing resources and activities  in  emergencies and  disasters,  including  foreign  military assets  (FMA) like those deployed in Indonesia and the Philippines have improved. Militaries have the equipment and skills to quickly deploy strategic airlifts like C-130s that  can  transport  and  operate  in  hard-to-reach  and  chaotic  disaster  contexts.  Our increasing knowledge about what militaries can contribute and how they can support civilian  responders  and  aid  workers  made  it  possible  to  structure  practices  for humanitarian civil-military coordination (CMCoord). The Missing Pieces Military HADR missions are becoming more common in many parts of the world, and CMCoord is gaining traction, especially in the Asia-Pacific. However, there is still a lot we do not know about military engagement in emergencies and disasters. There are three  key  reasons  behind  this: narrow data  processing, misjudgments about  HADR missions, and emerging security competition by proxy. Mainstream emergency and DRM data processing strongly focus on operational tasks of  traditional  systems  like  civilian-led  clusters.  This  eases  coordination  because  it highlights the general needs of the response rather than individual differences of those providing  aid.  Yet  it  provides  inadequate  information  on  other  actors  such  as  the military that work independently of, alongside, or with such systems. HADR activities can assist in saving lives and alleviating suffering. It can also enhance confidence-building  and  interoperability  between  militaries.  But  it  is  essentially  a military mission driven by other factors like defence capabilities, domestic politics, and foreign policy. HADR  enables  assisting  states  to  show  good  governance,  flex  military  might,  and project technological superiority that allow rivalries to play out. The military-political- security dimensions of HADR make it challenging for militaries to share information deemed sensitive. Linking the Parts, Revealing the Whole Militaries are vital to emergency and DRM activities in Southeast Asia. So how can the public increase its oversight and understanding of HADR missions to improve its governance for the benefit of affected communities? One way to address this research gap affecting policy and practice is to assess military HADR networks and see how they shape and influence regional aid and responses. To contribute to this end, RSIS' HADR Programme launched a Database Project that explores  the  web  of  relations  that  link  together  militaries  involved  in  HADR  in Southeast Asia. Using opensource data and network analysis, it examines the social structures and nature of individual ties to gain insight into HADR governance. ASEAN states have many differences but there is consensus that they can accomplish more  together  than  they  can  apart.  So  far,  they  have  remained  committed  to developing institutions and strategies for a more secure and stable region. This includes the alignment of different mechanisms and tools to facilitate joint HADR missions like the ASEAN Regional Forum, Regional Standby Arrangements (SASOP), Regional  Emergency  Response  Simulation  Exercise  (ARDEX),  and  Exercise Coordinated Response (ExCOORES), to name a few.

As a result, our ways of tracking and assessing resources and activities  in  emergencies and  disasters,  including  foreign  military assets  (FMA) like those deployed in Indonesia and the Philippines have improved. Militaries have the equipment and skills to quickly deploy strategic airlifts like C-130s that  can  transport  and  operate  in  hard-to-reach  and  chaotic  disaster  contexts.  Our increasing knowledge about what militaries can contribute and how they can support civilian  responders  and  aid  workers  made  it  possible  to  structure  practices  for humanitarian civil-military coordination (CMCoord). The Missing Pieces Military HADR missions are becoming more common in many parts of the world, and CMCoord is gaining traction, especially in the Asia-Pacific. However, there is still a lot we do not know about military engagement in emergencies and disasters. There are three  key  reasons  behind  this: narrow data  processing, misjudgments about  HADR missions, and emerging security competition by proxy. Mainstream emergency and DRM data processing strongly focus on operational tasks of  traditional  systems  like  civilian-led  clusters.  This  eases  coordination  because  it highlights the general needs of the response rather than individual differences of those providing  aid.  Yet  it  provides  inadequate  information  on  other  actors  such  as  the military that work independently of, alongside, or with such systems. HADR activities can assist in saving lives and alleviating suffering. It can also enhance confidence-building  and  interoperability  between  militaries.  But  it  is  essentially  a military mission driven by other factors like defence capabilities, domestic politics, and foreign policy. HADR  enables  assisting  states  to  show  good  governance,  flex  military  might,  and project technological superiority that allow rivalries to play out. The military-political- security dimensions of HADR make it challenging for militaries to share information deemed sensitive. Linking the Parts, Revealing the Whole Militaries are vital to emergency and DRM activities in Southeast Asia. So how can the public increase its oversight and understanding of HADR missions to improve its governance for the benefit of affected communities?

    "context": "COMMENTARY LEADERLESS FOR almost a year, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) has a new director-general  from  1  March  2021.  Dr  Ngozi  Okonjo-Iweala\u2019s  appointment  has attracted considerable attention, not only because she is the first woman and the first African to head the WTO, but also because of hopes that she can reboot the troubled global trade body. How realistic are those expectations and how much difference can the new DG make? Experience suggests the answer: less than many outside observers may expect, but enough to be significant given even moderately positive external circumstances. Director or General? The basic point about the post of DG is that it has no formal power apart from heading the Secretariat. With its origins in the improvised arrangements of the GATT, the WTO has not managed to become a full-fledged international organisation on the level of its Bretton Woods sisters, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the World Bank. Member governments jealously protect the \u201cmember-driven\u201d principle and push back at any suspicion of overreach by the Secretariat or its head. In a far more favourable time  for  the  WTO,  DG  Renato  Ruggiero  (1995-99)  was  rebuffed  by  members  for attempting to call meetings that were seen as beyond his mandate. Frustration at this and similar constraints contributed to his decision not to seek a second term. Unlike the European Commission, the WTO Secretariat, and its director-general, have no power of initiative. Furthermore, all significant decisions are taken by members, on the basis of consensus. Unlike the World Bank or IMF, it does not control important financial resources or a network of representatives around the world. It is small, less than  700  people,  based  only  in  Geneva,  and  dependent  on  annual  approval  by members of its modest budget. The reality of these limits contrasts strikingly with the myth of the WTO as a powerful and unaccountable body fostered by critics and by governments eager to offload their own  responsibilities,  like  the  Trump  administration  blaming  the  WTO  for  its  China problem. Relying on DG\u2019s Soft Power Despite the post\u2019s lack of hard power or even a defined role, some past DGs have been able to exercise considerable influence by skilful use of the various forms of soft power that it potentially offers. The incumbent normally has a high public profile and access to senior political levels as well as to key global forums like the G20. This  means  that  the  DG  should  be  well  placed  to  show  the  sort  of  leadership  in defending the multilateral system that has been largely absent in its present crisis. The advocacy role extends to media involvement as well. The DG is the only person who can credibly claim to speak for the WTO as a whole, though always under the watchful eyes of member governments. The DG\u2019s convening power is also important, though it is not unlimited. It was further limited by the previous DG\u2019s renunciation of the use of the \u201cGreen Room\u201d, which had been depicted in a sinister light. It was in fact simply a process of informal consultation by the DG with ad hoc groups of members to resolve particular issues. The new DG would be well advised to make use of it again, whatever she chooses to call it. A Balancing Act The DG has to strike a careful balance between the global face of the role and the need to cultivate the Geneva WTO Ambassadors. Their reporting and advice inform government positions, and DGs who have failed to sustain good working relationships with  them  have  been  less  effective.  In  particular,  the  DG\u2019s  relationship  with  the annually elected Chair of the General Council is critical. Peter Sutherland, who oversaw the conclusion of the Uruguay Round and became the WTO\u2019s  first  DG,  described  the  role  as  that  of  a  facilitator.  The  key  prerequisite  for success in this role is trust. A  DG  who  succeeds  in  establishing  themselves  as  an  honest  broker  can  have  a crucial,  though  always  necessarily discreet,  influence  on  the  course  of negotiations and on the confidence that members have in the organisation. At critical points in past negotiations members have often turned to the DG to help find solutions and broker compromises. They need to be able to do so again. WTO\u2019s Heady Challenges The  issues  that  the  WTO  faces  now  are  fundamental  ones.  Is  it  still  possible  to negotiate  multilaterally?  The  fisheries  subsidies  and  agriculture  processes  are  not encouraging.  If  plurilateral  approaches  are  more  promising,  how  are  they  to  be reconciled with the multilateral system? India and South Africa have recently fired warning shots about their legal standing. One  immediate  issue  is  how  the  WTO  can  best  assist  recovery  from  COVID.  A potential tussle over intellectual property rights and vaccines is something the DG will have to approach more carefully than her recent statements suggest. Looking further ahead, the relationship between trade rules and climate change will also be an increasingly important focus of Dr Okonjo-Iweala\u2019s term. There is little sign that the WTO system is prepared for the challenge. WTO Reform: Much Touted, Little Understood WTO  reform  is  much  touted  but  little  understood.

With its origins in the improvised arrangements of the GATT, the WTO has not managed to become a full-fledged international organisation on the level of its Bretton Woods sisters, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the World Bank. Member governments jealously protect the \u201cmember-driven\u201d principle and push back at any suspicion of overreach by the Secretariat or its head. In a far more favourable time  for  the  WTO,  DG  Renato  Ruggiero  (1995-99)  was  rebuffed  by  members  for attempting to call meetings that were seen as beyond his mandate. Frustration at this and similar constraints contributed to his decision not to seek a second term. Unlike the European Commission, the WTO Secretariat, and its director-general, have no power of initiative. Furthermore, all significant decisions are taken by members, on the basis of consensus. Unlike the World Bank or IMF, it does not control important financial resources or a network of representatives around the world. It is small, less than  700  people,  based  only  in  Geneva,  and  dependent  on  annual  approval  by members of its modest budget. The reality of these limits contrasts strikingly with the myth of the WTO as a powerful and unaccountable body fostered by critics and by governments eager to offload their own  responsibilities,  like  the  Trump  administration  blaming  the  WTO  for  its  China problem. Relying on DG\u2019s Soft Power Despite the post\u2019s lack of hard power or even a defined role, some past DGs have been able to exercise considerable influence by skilful use of the various forms of soft power that it potentially offers. The incumbent normally has a high public profile and access to senior political levels as well as to key global forums like the G20. This  means  that  the  DG  should  be  well  placed  to  show  the  sort  of  leadership  in defending the multilateral system that has been largely absent in its present crisis. The advocacy role extends to media involvement as well. The DG is the only person who can credibly claim to speak for the WTO as a whole, though always under the watchful eyes of member governments. The DG\u2019s convening power is also important, though it is not unlimited. It was further limited by the previous DG\u2019s renunciation of the use of the \u201cGreen Room\u201d, which had been depicted in a sinister light. It was in fact simply a process of informal consultation by the DG with ad hoc groups of members to resolve particular issues. The new DG would be well advised to make use of it again, whatever she chooses to call it. A Balancing Act The DG has to strike a careful balance between the global face of the role and the need to cultivate the Geneva WTO Ambassadors. Their reporting and advice inform government positions, and DGs who have failed to sustain good working relationships with  them  have  been  less  effective.  In  particular,  the  DG\u2019s  relationship  with  the annually elected Chair of the General Council is critical. Peter Sutherland, who oversaw the conclusion of the Uruguay Round and became the WTO\u2019s  first  DG,  described  the  role  as  that  of  a  facilitator.  The  key  prerequisite  for success in this role is trust. A  DG  who  succeeds  in  establishing  themselves  as  an  honest  broker  can  have  a crucial,  though  always  necessarily discreet,  influence  on  the  course  of negotiations and on the confidence that members have in the organisation. At critical points in past negotiations members have often turned to the DG to help find solutions and broker compromises. They need to be able to do so again. WTO\u2019s Heady Challenges The  issues  that  the  WTO  faces  now  are  fundamental  ones.  Is  it  still  possible  to negotiate  multilaterally?  The  fisheries  subsidies  and  agriculture  processes  are  not encouraging.  If  plurilateral  approaches  are  more  promising,  how  are  they  to  be reconciled with the multilateral system? India and South Africa have recently fired warning shots about their legal standing. One  immediate  issue  is  how  the  WTO  can  best  assist  recovery  from  COVID.  A potential tussle over intellectual property rights and vaccines is something the DG will have to approach more carefully than her recent statements suggest. Looking further ahead, the relationship between trade rules and climate change will also be an increasingly important focus of Dr Okonjo-Iweala\u2019s term. There is little sign that the WTO system is prepared for the challenge. WTO Reform: Much Touted, Little Understood WTO  reform  is  much  touted  but  little  understood.

    "context": "COMMENTARY DESPITE  THE  sound  and  fury  from  political  leaders  in  Washington  and  London opposing the February 2021 Myanmar military (Tatmadaw) coup, Western states have very limited leverage with Myanmar. After 25 years of cultivating access to the Myanmar leadership, including the military, ASEAN  is  better  positioned  to  shape  the  international  response  to  the  Tatmadaw\u2019s takeover. ASEAN\u2019s Dilemma ASEAN itself faces a dilemma: Thailand and Vietnam, supported by Cambodia and Laos, have advocated for accepting the coup, in line with ASEAN\u2019s traditional focus on non-interference. Indonesia,  Malaysia  and  Singapore  condemned  the  use  of  force  against  unarmed civilians and pointed to ASEAN member states\u2019 Charter commitments to act in \u2018respect for  fundamental  freedoms,  the  promotion  and  protection  of  human  rights,  and  the promotion of social justice\u2019. Doing  nothing  is  not  an  option.  The  challenge  is  to  deliver  a  cohesive  ASEAN response. At the special ASEAN summit in Jakarta on 24 April 2021, several ASEAN leaders did not refer to Min Aung Hliang as the head of the Myanmar State Administration Council. There  were  also  references  to  major  figures  of  the  ousted  regime,  Win  Myint  as President and Aung San Suu Kyi as State Counsellor and Foreign Minister. For  ASEAN,  the  convening  of  a  summit  to  discuss  the  coup  marked  a  shift  in  its handling  of  such  events.  Previously,  ASEAN  would  have  accepted  the  change  of government, even if some members were unhappy with the developments that had taken place. Leaders' Five-Point Consensus The summit reached a five point consensus: an immediate cessation of violence and utmost restraint by all parties; constructive dialogue among all parties; a special envoy of  the  ASEAN  chair  to  facilitate  mediation;  humanitarian  assistance  through  the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance; and the special envoy to visit Myanmar to meet with all concerned parties. A  sixth  point  on  the  release  of  political  prisoners  was  moved  to  the  Chairman\u2019s statement to avoid objections from Min Aung Hliang. Including it may have unravelled the consensus, given Min Aung Hliang\u2019s trenchant criticisms of Aung San Suu Kyi, the National League for Democracy (NLD) and the conduct of the elections which saw the NLD overwhelmingly returned to power. The UN Security Council has endorsed the ASEAN consensus. The UN Special Envoy for Myanmar Christine Schraner Burgener\u2019s requests to visit Myanmar were ignored by authorities until she turned up at the ASEAN summit and a meeting was arranged with Min Aung Hliang. The question now is how soon the Myanmar military authorities will permit a visit by the ASEAN special envoy. During  the  visit,  the  envoy  should  focus  on  securing  an  immediate  cessation  of violence, the release of some political prisoners, access to leading political prisoners and the implementation of the agreement on humanitarian assistance. But Myanmar authorities will try to delay a visit ostensibly because \u2018stability\u2019 and \u2018law and order\u2019 need to  be  restored.  A  visit  by  Brunei,  the  current  chair  of  ASEAN,  will  likely  take  place sooner. Western Sanctions Western states have pressed for sanctions on trade, investment, military exchanges and  the  supply  of  military  equipment  to  Myanmar.  When  Western  states  called  for sanctions  previously,  they  excluded  their  most  significant  investments  in  Myanmar, including  oil  and  gas  investments  by  Total  (France),  Chevron  (United  States)  and Woodside (Australia). As  Western  investors  are  not  significant  players  in  other  sectors  of  the  Myanmar economy, their imposition of sanctions will not be taken seriously by the Tatmadaw. Myanmar\u2019s neighbours including China, India, Thailand and Bangladesh continue to trade with Myanmar, despite being unhappy with the coup. While Japanese and other Asian  corporations  have  reduced  or  cut  business  ties  with  Myanmar  military-linked corporations,  their  governments  are  unlikely  to  support  Western  calls  for  economic sanctions. Myanmar\u2019s two biggest military suppliers, China and Russia, maintain close ties with the Myanmar military and effectively blocked the inclusion of critical references and bans on arms sales in Security Council statements. Sanctions will only work if they are imposed by the UN Security Council. This will not happen as Myanmar is protected by the Chinese and Russian veto. Persuading the Myanmar Military Domestic  resistance  to  the  takeover  or  criticism  from  foreign  governments  and international  civil  society  organisations  will  not  deter  the  Myanmar  military.

    "context": "COMMENTARY DESPITE  THE  sound  and  fury  from  political  leaders  in  Washington  and  London opposing the February 2021 Myanmar military (Tatmadaw) coup, Western states have very limited leverage with Myanmar. After 25 years of cultivating access to the Myanmar leadership, including the military, ASEAN  is  better  positioned  to  shape  the  international  response  to  the  Tatmadaw\u2019s takeover. ASEAN\u2019s Dilemma ASEAN itself faces a dilemma: Thailand and Vietnam, supported by Cambodia and Laos, have advocated for accepting the coup, in line with ASEAN\u2019s traditional focus on non-interference. Indonesia,  Malaysia  and  Singapore  condemned  the  use  of  force  against  unarmed civilians and pointed to ASEAN member states\u2019 Charter commitments to act in \u2018respect for  fundamental  freedoms,  the  promotion  and  protection  of  human  rights,  and  the promotion of social justice\u2019. Doing  nothing  is  not  an  option.  The  challenge  is  to  deliver  a  cohesive  ASEAN response. At the special ASEAN summit in Jakarta on 24 April 2021, several ASEAN leaders did not refer to Min Aung Hliang as the head of the Myanmar State Administration Council. There  were  also  references  to  major  figures  of  the  ousted  regime,  Win  Myint  as President and Aung San Suu Kyi as State Counsellor and Foreign Minister. For  ASEAN,  the  convening  of  a  summit  to  discuss  the  coup  marked  a  shift  in  its handling  of  such  events.  Previously,  ASEAN  would  have  accepted  the  change  of government, even if some members were unhappy with the developments that had taken place. Leaders' Five-Point Consensus The summit reached a five point consensus: an immediate cessation of violence and utmost restraint by all parties; constructive dialogue among all parties; a special envoy of  the  ASEAN  chair  to  facilitate  mediation;  humanitarian  assistance  through  the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance; and the special envoy to visit Myanmar to meet with all concerned parties. A  sixth  point  on  the  release  of  political  prisoners  was  moved  to  the  Chairman\u2019s statement to avoid objections from Min Aung Hliang. Including it may have unravelled the consensus, given Min Aung Hliang\u2019s trenchant criticisms of Aung San Suu Kyi, the National League for Democracy (NLD) and the conduct of the elections which saw the NLD overwhelmingly returned to power. The UN Security Council has endorsed the ASEAN consensus. The UN Special Envoy for Myanmar Christine Schraner Burgener\u2019s requests to visit Myanmar were ignored by authorities until she turned up at the ASEAN summit and a meeting was arranged with Min Aung Hliang. The question now is how soon the Myanmar military authorities will permit a visit by the ASEAN special envoy. During  the  visit,  the  envoy  should  focus  on  securing  an  immediate  cessation  of violence, the release of some political prisoners, access to leading political prisoners and the implementation of the agreement on humanitarian assistance. But Myanmar authorities will try to delay a visit ostensibly because \u2018stability\u2019 and \u2018law and order\u2019 need to  be  restored.  A  visit  by  Brunei,  the  current  chair  of  ASEAN,  will  likely  take  place sooner. Western Sanctions Western states have pressed for sanctions on trade, investment, military exchanges and  the  supply  of  military  equipment  to  Myanmar.  When  Western  states  called  for sanctions  previously,  they  excluded  their  most  significant  investments  in  Myanmar, including  oil  and  gas  investments  by  Total  (France),  Chevron  (United  States)  and Woodside (Australia). As  Western  investors  are  not  significant  players  in  other  sectors  of  the  Myanmar economy, their imposition of sanctions will not be taken seriously by the Tatmadaw. Myanmar\u2019s neighbours including China, India, Thailand and Bangladesh continue to trade with Myanmar, despite being unhappy with the coup. While Japanese and other Asian  corporations  have  reduced  or  cut  business  ties  with  Myanmar  military-linked corporations,  their  governments  are  unlikely  to  support  Western  calls  for  economic sanctions. Myanmar\u2019s two biggest military suppliers, China and Russia, maintain close ties with the Myanmar military and effectively blocked the inclusion of critical references and bans on arms sales in Security Council statements. Sanctions will only work if they are imposed by the UN Security Council. This will not happen as Myanmar is protected by the Chinese and Russian veto. Persuading the Myanmar Military Domestic  resistance  to  the  takeover  or  criticism  from  foreign  governments  and international  civil  society  organisations  will  not  deter  the  Myanmar  military.

    "context": "COMMENTARY COVID-19\u2019s SOCIO-ECONOMIC costs are mounting. Assessing cumulative damage is an ongoing process, but it suffices to say that the economic contractions underway are  unprecedented  since  the  1930\u2019s  Great  Depression.  With  the  fallout  unevenly distributed, economically insecure populations are likely to bear the brunt of pandemic- induced shocks. Taking the edge off this suffering will thus require improving welfare delivery well into an increasingly digital age. How then can countries in the region better deliver social assistance, such as caregiving and medicine, through technology as they accelerate digital transformations in the new normal? Need for Rethinking on Social Safety Nets For one, digital welfare assistance may involve ensuring social wellbeing in hitherto less regulated segments of the digital economy. The gig economy is a prime example. Many workers in this growing sector lack welfare coverage, a gap which can perhaps be plugged using technology. So far, governments have taken to combating potential unemployment with subsidised wages, incentivising businesses to keep employees on their payroll. It is questionable, however, whether layoffs can continue to be kept at bay. Social safety nets contingent on traditional employment models thus need rethinking, especially  since  recessions  are  not  the  only  job  loss-catalysts  on  the  horizon.  The pandemic will end. Trends such as automation still loom large. COVID-19 has thus exposed how unprepared countries are even for anticipated scenarios. ASEAN\u2019s Gig Economy & Social Safety Many countries are in the nascent stages of regulating how gig workers fit into social safety  schemes.  Across  ASEAN,  gig  workers  are  unprotected  under  respective Employment Acts  albeit  countries  such as  Malaysia,  Singapore and  the  Philippines have rolled out certain provisions to soften the blow of work-related risks and improve worker resilience. Uncertainty  underpins  this  regulatory  lag.  Gig  workers are  a  catch-all  category  that covers freelance professionals and low-wage labour with varying degrees of financial literacy and economic security. Debate persists over who qualifies as a gig worker, and  hence  should  receive  employment-associated  benefits  like  health  insurance  or employee fund contributions. Even where governments have agreed to distribute aid to all gig workers during the pandemic,  they  were  often  thwarted  by  missing  tax  records  and  their  linked  bank account details. Certain digital platforms do not provide information on earnings, which makes it difficult for workers to substantiate income loss claims. Elsewhere, gig workers struggle with low financial literacy and awareness of how to file taxes, insufficient digital literacy obstructing access to these programs, and patchy universal internet access. Using Technology for Long-Term Social Protection In the throes of this pandemic, technology could also be deployed more efficiently for social protection purposes to manage its long-run effects on top of immediate health crises. Though  data  on  infections  is  taking  centre-stage,  collecting  real-time,  interoperable datasets  on  most  vulnerable  populations  could  facilitate  targeted  assistance  where urgency is critical. Similarly, this would allow for follow up on the effectiveness of and challenges to fully using distributed aid. Another option is to further harness technology to flatten the emerging post-pandemic mental health curve. Policies availing widespread, online mental health support would complement  current  telemedicine  efforts  that  more  generally  address  physical ailments. Where mental health issues remain stigmatised, awareness campaigns may prove useful. Going  forward  then,  digital  welfare  transitions  should  entail  better  integration  and synergy between online and offline elements. Where  absent,  universal  healthcare  coverage  would  shift  risks  off  economically insecure  individuals  in  the  gig  economy,  while  those  financially  able  could  choose additional  market-based  welfare  solutions  if  desired.  Allowing  self-contributions  to employee  funds  and  upskilling  courses,  as  Malaysia  and  Singapore  demonstrate, could be similarly beneficial. Another example is providing work-related insurance, since market actors generally shy  away  from  insuring  high-risk  individuals  in  the  informal  economy.  Economic, financial  and  digital  literacy  should  be  better  incorporated  into  education  syllabi, whereas data sharing between platforms and governments, meanwhile, could address information gaps vis-\u00e0-vis income claims. Affordable,  accessible  and  quality  universal  internet  access  is  fundamental,  but improving infrastructure takes time and resources. Low-tech solutions should not be shunned in the interim. Offline aid distribution is an inescapable reality where digital connectivity is lacking. ASEAN: Sustaining Welfare Spending Post-Pandemic Where mobile Internet  connectivity exceeds broadband penetration across much of ASEAN, governments could roll out aid through singular platforms designed for low speed connections and low spec (low performance) mobile phones, in a similar vein to apps such as Facebook Lite. This could streamline access to patchwork social safety initiatives, which is a problem with  non-interoperable  datasets  such  as  in  Indonesia,  while  avoiding  overlap  of welfare  coverage.  Digitalisation  in  this  context  should  nonetheless  proceed  with caution to ensure privacy protection, as well as institutional checks and balances to avoid abuses stemming from data concentration in a single ministry or office. ASEAN  countries  could  further make  moves  to  sustain  increased  welfare  spending post-pandemic. Despite the rise of mental health issues, social spending on that front lags, with mental healthcare belatedly being classified as an essential service in places such as Singapore. For  several  ASEAN  members,  financing  will  be  a  challenge  to  delivering  on  these public  goods  amidst  a  global  economic  environment  marked  by,  inter  alia, protectionism and investment uncertainty. ASEAN should, in this manner, continue to pursue  economic  multilateralism  to  navigate  economic  turbulence  and  leverage collective resilience. Faultlines of Inequality: No Panacea Perhaps more importantly, the social \u2014 and necessarily human \u2014 spirit should not be excised  as  countries  undertake  greater  digital  transformation.  There  are  risks  that come with delegating socioeconomic regulation to algorithms and automated systems.",

Assessing cumulative damage is an ongoing process, but it suffices to say that the economic contractions underway are  unprecedented  since  the  1930\u2019s  Great  Depression.  With  the  fallout  unevenly distributed, economically insecure populations are likely to bear the brunt of pandemic- induced shocks. Taking the edge off this suffering will thus require improving welfare delivery well into an increasingly digital age. How then can countries in the region better deliver social assistance, such as caregiving and medicine, through technology as they accelerate digital transformations in the new normal? Need for Rethinking on Social Safety Nets For one, digital welfare assistance may involve ensuring social wellbeing in hitherto less regulated segments of the digital economy. The gig economy is a prime example. Many workers in this growing sector lack welfare coverage, a gap which can perhaps be plugged using technology. So far, governments have taken to combating potential unemployment with subsidised wages, incentivising businesses to keep employees on their payroll. It is questionable, however, whether layoffs can continue to be kept at bay. Social safety nets contingent on traditional employment models thus need rethinking, especially  since  recessions  are  not  the  only  job  loss-catalysts  on  the  horizon.  The pandemic will end. Trends such as automation still loom large. COVID-19 has thus exposed how unprepared countries are even for anticipated scenarios. ASEAN\u2019s Gig Economy & Social Safety Many countries are in the nascent stages of regulating how gig workers fit into social safety  schemes.  Across  ASEAN,  gig  workers  are  unprotected  under  respective Employment Acts  albeit  countries  such as  Malaysia,  Singapore and  the  Philippines have rolled out certain provisions to soften the blow of work-related risks and improve worker resilience. Uncertainty  underpins  this  regulatory  lag.  Gig  workers are  a  catch-all  category  that covers freelance professionals and low-wage labour with varying degrees of financial literacy and economic security. Debate persists over who qualifies as a gig worker, and  hence  should  receive  employment-associated  benefits  like  health  insurance  or employee fund contributions. Even where governments have agreed to distribute aid to all gig workers during the pandemic,  they  were  often  thwarted  by  missing  tax  records  and  their  linked  bank account details. Certain digital platforms do not provide information on earnings, which makes it difficult for workers to substantiate income loss claims. Elsewhere, gig workers struggle with low financial literacy and awareness of how to file taxes, insufficient digital literacy obstructing access to these programs, and patchy universal internet access. Using Technology for Long-Term Social Protection In the throes of this pandemic, technology could also be deployed more efficiently for social protection purposes to manage its long-run effects on top of immediate health crises. Though  data  on  infections  is  taking  centre-stage,  collecting  real-time,  interoperable datasets  on  most  vulnerable  populations  could  facilitate  targeted  assistance  where urgency is critical. Similarly, this would allow for follow up on the effectiveness of and challenges to fully using distributed aid. Another option is to further harness technology to flatten the emerging post-pandemic mental health curve. Policies availing widespread, online mental health support would complement  current  telemedicine  efforts  that  more  generally  address  physical ailments. Where mental health issues remain stigmatised, awareness campaigns may prove useful. Going  forward  then,  digital  welfare  transitions  should  entail  better  integration  and synergy between online and offline elements. Where  absent,  universal  healthcare  coverage  would  shift  risks  off  economically insecure  individuals  in  the  gig  economy,  while  those  financially  able  could  choose additional  market-based  welfare  solutions  if  desired.  Allowing  self-contributions  to employee  funds  and  upskilling  courses,  as  Malaysia  and  Singapore  demonstrate, could be similarly beneficial. Another example is providing work-related insurance, since market actors generally shy  away  from  insuring  high-risk  individuals  in  the  informal  economy.  Economic, financial  and  digital  literacy  should  be  better  incorporated  into  education  syllabi, whereas data sharing between platforms and governments, meanwhile, could address information gaps vis-\u00e0-vis income claims. Affordable,  accessible  and  quality  universal  internet  access  is  fundamental,  but improving infrastructure takes time and resources. Low-tech solutions should not be shunned in the interim. Offline aid distribution is an inescapable reality where digital connectivity is lacking. ASEAN: Sustaining Welfare Spending Post-Pandemic Where mobile Internet  connectivity exceeds broadband penetration across much of ASEAN, governments could roll out aid through singular platforms designed for low speed connections and low spec (low performance) mobile phones, in a similar vein to apps such as Facebook Lite. This could streamline access to patchwork social safety initiatives, which is a problem with  non-interoperable  datasets  such  as  in  Indonesia,  while  avoiding  overlap  of welfare  coverage.

    "context": "COMMENTARY GOVERNMENTS  AROUND  the  globe  are  launching  contact  tracing  applications  in their  fight  against  COVID-19.  These  contact-tracing  applications  come  with  various levels of data collection, data privacy and security practices. Some applications are mandatory while others are voluntary. This global trend engenders concerns  about privacy  and the potential  use  of  these tools after the pandemic. These concerns emerge as a factor preventing the optimal rate  of  adoption  of  applications  and  branch  into  debates  if  they  could  be  better marketed,  or  whether  they  work.  An  Oxford  study  suggested  that  contact  tracing applications need at least 60% adoption rate to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Contact Tracing Landscape The  landscape  is  diverse  as  countries  design  contact-tracing  applications  with different levels of technical features, and legal frameworks for privacy protection. State policy  towards  privacy  is  a  significant  factor  that  could  affect  how  entrenched  any surveillance technology would be in a country\u2019s social governance. In India, the Aarogya Setu contact tracing application was launched as voluntary but subsequently enforced on \u201ccentral government\u201d employees and staff of some private companies. The application\u2019s privacy policy and terms of service lack transparency on how it \"tracks and stores location data\". India\u2019s proposed Data Protection Bill (2019) has been criticised for \u201coversupply[ing] government intervention and strengthen[ing] the state.\u201d In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides a degree of legal protection against any infringement of data privacy by contact tracing applications. In Singapore, the TraceTogether application is designed with transparency and privacy in  mind.  The  source-code  of  the  TraceTogether  is  made  open-source,  and  it  is available for interested parties to audit. The  global  research  community  has  begun  initiatives  to  help  improve  privacy. However,  the  extent  to  which  governments  would  go  to  enhance  the  privacy  and security of their contact-tracing applications remains a question. But how would people feel  if  they  gain  nothing  from  sacrificing  more  privacy  (and  face  more  cyber-attack risks) than they agreed? Contact Tracing Beyond Healthcare? While discussions over privacy continue, another related issue is about expanding the reach  of  contact  tracing  applications  to  people  who  lack  smartphone  access.  For instance,  Singapore  is  deliberating  the  distribution  of  a  wearable  contact-tracing device to everyone in the country. Singapore has also implemented SafeEntry as a mandatory national check-in/check- out system for high-risk venues such as shopping malls. As countries ease lockdown restrictions, a more extensive reach is crucial to preventing COVID-19 resurgence. The use of multiple contact-tracing tools raises the question of how data from various platforms  could  be  mined  for  predictive  analysis,  and  inform  government  policies during and after the pandemic. For instance, could and should the data be used to predict potential future clusters? Would it be in the public interest if governments expand the use of the data beyond healthcare to other aspects of social governance, or not? What would happen if the government leverages the data for forecasting in non-COVID related areas such as crime prevention and social management? Technology & Social Discontent Scenarios Social discontent is set to worsen as COVID-19-related restrictions cause widespread economic  disruptions.  In  the  United  States,  masses  have  poured  to  the  streets  to protest against these restrictions. The ideological leanings of some protest groups are under scrutiny. The World Economic Forum foresees a \"prolonged recession of the global economy\" and social discontent over the next 18 months. Many countries are likely to see a surge in dissatisfaction over livelihood matters. To  anticipate  plausible  dangers,  imagine  a  hypothetical  country  where  citizens demand government interventions in the aftermath of this major crisis. However, the government  is  running  out  of  resources and scales  back on  support measures  that should  be  easing  socioeconomic  pressures.  Some  citizens  resort  to  petty  crime  or undesirable activities to mitigate these pressures. These people eschew the use of contact-tracing applications, given the perceived risk of  police  detection,  arrest,  and  shame.  Consequently,  they  become  a  vector  of undetected community transmission in a new wave of COVID-19. \u2018Sousveillance\u2019: Watching the Watchers In  another  scenario,  some  segments  of  the  society  are  more  severely  hit  by  the pandemic.  People  in  low-wage  and  low-skilled  sectors,  the  gig  economy,  and  the unemployed are in the most precarious state. Economist Guy Standing argues that a person  in  these  circumstances  \u201c\u2026  lives  in  public  spaces  but  is  vulnerable  to surveillance and undemocratic nudging.\u201d The angrier ones in these groups may find it harder to subjugate their privacy to state surveillance. They  embrace  \u201csousveillance\u201d  such  as  filming  police  officers  on  duty.  This counterculture of  watching  the  watchers can  be  a  form  of  protest. The  hypothetical",

While discussions over privacy continue, another related issue is about expanding the reach  of  contact  tracing  applications  to  people  who  lack  smartphone  access.  For instance,  Singapore  is  deliberating  the  distribution  of  a  wearable  contact-tracing device to everyone in the country. Singapore has also implemented SafeEntry as a mandatory national check-in/check- out system for high-risk venues such as shopping malls. As countries ease lockdown restrictions, a more extensive reach is crucial to preventing COVID-19 resurgence. The use of multiple contact-tracing tools raises the question of how data from various platforms  could  be  mined  for  predictive  analysis,  and  inform  government  policies during and after the pandemic. For instance, could and should the data be used to predict potential future clusters? Would it be in the public interest if governments expand the use of the data beyond healthcare to other aspects of social governance, or not? What would happen if the government leverages the data for forecasting in non-COVID related areas such as crime prevention and social management? Technology & Social Discontent Scenarios Social discontent is set to worsen as COVID-19-related restrictions cause widespread economic  disruptions.  In  the  United  States,  masses  have  poured  to  the  streets  to protest against these restrictions. The ideological leanings of some protest groups are under scrutiny. The World Economic Forum foresees a \"prolonged recession of the global economy\" and social discontent over the next 18 months. Many countries are likely to see a surge in dissatisfaction over livelihood matters. To  anticipate  plausible  dangers,  imagine  a  hypothetical  country  where  citizens demand government interventions in the aftermath of this major crisis. However, the government  is  running  out  of  resources and scales  back on  support measures  that should  be  easing  socioeconomic  pressures.  Some  citizens  resort  to  petty  crime  or undesirable activities to mitigate these pressures. These people eschew the use of contact-tracing applications, given the perceived risk of  police  detection,  arrest,  and  shame.  Consequently,  they  become  a  vector  of undetected community transmission in a new wave of COVID-19. \u2018Sousveillance\u2019: Watching the Watchers In  another  scenario,  some  segments  of  the  society  are  more  severely  hit  by  the pandemic.

These  contact-tracing  applications  come  with  various levels of data collection, data privacy and security practices. Some applications are mandatory while others are voluntary.

    "context": "COMMENTARY CHINA MADE waves recently in financial circles when it trialled its Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) \u2013 a digital renminbi \u2013 across four cities in April 2020. The trial  was  expanded  when  the  People\u2019s  Bank  of  China  announced  that  the  city  of Shenzhen  will  distribute  RMB10  million  (around  S$2  million),  for  free,  in  a  lottery system to residents, which they can spend the e-renminbi in selected merchants and in their city\u2019s metro system. The lottery was oversubscribed with two million registrants vying for 50,000 digital \u2018red packets\u2019, each worth 200 Chinese yuan. The Chinese experience catalysed a wave of discussions by central banks around the world \u2013 how best to harness and implement a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), and what good will it bring to the state? It is worth bearing in mind that CBDCs are not the sole remit of nation states as regional groupings are showing keen interest as well. Regional Interests & ASEAN Digital Currency? The  European  Union,  for  example,  has  accelerated  its  efforts  into  studying  how  a digital  euro  could  be  initiated  and  public  consultations  have  taken  place  since  12 October this year. While the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) recently  introduced  a  single  currency  (the  eco),  crypto-enthusiasts  pointed  out  how this was a missed opportunity to digitalise the currency on blockchain technology. It is timely, then, for ASEAN to kickstart discussions on the possibility of a CDBC and how such an \u2018ASEAN Coin\u2019 might look like. The most obvious benefit of an ASEAN digital currency is that it would dramatically lower cross-border transactions and payments. Where a company would previously exchange  currency  to  pay  for  cross-border  goods  or  services,  an  ASEAN  digital currency  promises  to  cut  out  middleman  costs  for  currency  exchanges  and  make payments instantaneously. Plugged in with the latest developments in the sphere of \u2018decentralised finance\u2019 and \u2018smart contracts\u2019, it has the potential to be radically transformative. This would also be synergistic with existing ASEAN projects such as the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), ASEAN  Investment  Area  (AIA)  and  the  ASEAN  Connectivity  2025  roadmap.  An ASEAN Coin can certainly be catalytic to the emphasis on establishing ASEAN as a \u201csingle market and production base\u201d and having a \u201cfree and open investment regime\u201d. Second,  a  2019  Bain  report  suggests  that  seven  out  of  10  Southeast  Asians  are underbanked  or unbanked, having  \u201cno  access  to  credit  cards or have  no  long-term savings  product\u201d  or  \u201cwithout  access  to  a  basic  bank  account\u201d.  An  ASEAN  digital currency can bring financial inclusion to the millions of unbanked and underbanked ASEAN citizens and small businesses. For example, a fisherman in Indonesia could theoretically be plugged into the ASEAN financial ecosystem with a smartphone \u2013 and do business directly with other ASEAN companies and end consumers - without holding a bank account. Promoting ASEAN Financial & Political Centrality Third, an ASEAN digital currency can help the bloc preserve its financial and political centrality.  Given  the  maturity  of  the  Chinese  e-renminbi,  it  is  only  a  matter  of  time before it gets rolled out nationally. When that happens, the next natural step is to blend the e-renminbi into its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and regional diplomatic efforts. It is reported that merchants in Seoul\u2019s Myeongdong District (which sees substantial Chinese  tourists)  are  open  to  transacting  in  the  e-renminbi.  Given  that  Alipay  and WeChat are already common payment options in much of Southeast Asia, it would be rather frictionless to transit into the e-Renminbi system. In  any  event,  having  an  ASEAN  CBDC  could  bolster  the  regional  group\u2019s  financial autonomy  \u2013  ensuring  that  it does  not  have  to  rely on any major power  for financial inclusion or be overly dependent on extra-mural forces for its fintech architecture. To be  sure,  ASEAN  countries  are  already  at  various  stages  of  developing  their  own CBDCs. Singapore and Thailand\u2019s experimentations with CBDCs are at a very mature stage and  could  see  pilot  implementations  shortly.  Other  ASEAN  countries  such  as  the Philippines are considering introducing a CBDC. In that way, technical know-how and expert knowledge already exist at the ASEAN level to get things going. Vision of ASEAN Coin & Its Challenges Notwithstanding the potential for ASEAN countries to create  an ASEAN Coin, there remain  considerable  challenges  to  realising  this  vision.  First,  digital  infrastructures differ significantly. A few countries are substantially ahead of others in having robust and technically sound digital eco-systems. Singapore, for instance, ranks fourth worldwide in the global connectivity index and has a mobile penetration rate of around 150 per cent. This is far higher than Laos, which saw its mobile penetration rates reach only 54 per cent in 2017, while Internet penetration rates stood at 43 per cent in January 2020. Next, and perhaps the biggest challenge is to convince political leaders that an ASEAN digital currency do not necessarily have to entail a pooling of sovereignty nor having a  single monetary system.  An  ASEAN wide digital currency  could model itself  after Facebook\u2019s  Libra  template  \u2013  pegging  it  to  a  basket  of  ASEAN  currencies  \u2013  thus ensuring  price  stability  and  without  the  need  for  countries  to  give  up  their  national currencies. The central banks of member states must then ensure that this ASEAN coin is liquid and  easily  exchangeable  to  respective  national  currencies.  In  any  event,  previous infrastructural,  financial,  and  economic  disparities  have  not  prevented  ASEAN  from setting ambitious goals such as the realisation of an ASEAN Economic Community. Unintended Consequences As  with  any  novel  ideas,  the  prospects  of  unintended  consequences  remain.  An ASEAN  Coin,  could,  foreseeably  throw  the  national  monetary  policies  of  ASEAN",

This  is  specially  so  for  the  class  of biotechnology  crops  commonly  called  \u2018GMO\u2019  or  genetically  modified  organism.  The controversy has led to public concerns about their food safety, in spite of the fact that GMOs are only approved after years of intensive testing by independent government agencies, evaluation and approval upon satisfying stringent criteria for safety. This  approval  of  Golden  Rice  and  the  lesser-known  Bt  eggplant  are  therefore milestones  in  the  use  of  biotechnology  to  meet  food  security  needs  through  more (nutritious) food with less pesticides. In the 29 countries which currently grow GMO- biotechnology crops in 2019, over 17 million farmers growing about 91 million hectares have been shown to benefit financially and health-wise. So has the environment from the  reduced  insecticide  use.  At  the  same  time,  worldwide,  beyond  the  29  growing countries, another 43 countries import GMO-biotechnology crops for food, feed and processing; this includes Singapore. Golden Rice: Addressing Vitamin A Deficiency The Philippines has a high incidence of Vitamin A Deficiency (VAD) which can lead to blindness and death, particularly among children. Rice is the staple in the Philippines, with many households consuming it two to three times a day. Almost 20 years ago, an international group tested the development of a rice variety which could provide enhanced levels of Vitamin A and  therefore relief for the many malnourished children in developing countries. This  enhanced  Beta-carotene  rice  subsequently  came  to  be  called  \u201cGolden  Rice\u201d because of the yellow hue in the grains. The development and testing of this rice has gone  through  intensive  scrutiny  by  scientific  and  regulatory  bodies  in  several countries.  Indeed  this  rice  has  been  tested  for  safety  and  environmental  concerns more than any other modern rice variety. The  World  Health  Organisation  (WHO)  estimates  that  over  half  a  million  children worldwide are affected by VAD, with disastrous impact. The International Rice Institute (IRRI) estimated that 17% of children under five in the Philippines suffer from VAD, so the Golden Rice has the potential to change the fight against this disease. Bt Eggplant: Engineered To Reduce Insecticide Use Eggplant  (a.k.a.  Aubergine) is one  of  the most  widely consumed  fruit  vegetables  in South and Southeast Asia. However, eggplant is highly susceptible to the fruit borer which severely damages the fruit that is sold through its feeding on the fleshy part of the fruit that is used by humans. To  produce  a  crop  that  is  cosmetically  acceptable  to  consumers  and  profitable  for farmers,  almost  all  eggplant  farmers  have  resorted  to  using  insecticides.  In Bangladesh, eggplant farmers have been known to spray as many as 70 times in a single  season  to  ensure  that  their  crop  is  saleable!  Oftentimes  the  pest  has  also become immune to the cocktail of insecticides used. The  alternative  technology  that  was  proposed  in  the  early  2000\u2019s  was  to  use biotechnology  to  give  resistance  to  the  fruit  borer  so  that  insecticide  use  could  be reduced, farmers could produce a crop and consumers could buy a safer vegetable. Scientists  engineered  eggplant  with  a  gene  from  a  common  soil  bacterium  called Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) and were able to show greatly increased resistance to the pest. This same bacterium in its raw form is used by organic farmers for pest control. The same Bt technology has also been successfully used in crops like maize, soybean and cotton. Indeed Bangladesh became the first country to grow this Bt eggplant in 2014 and since then some 34,000 small farmers have grown over 2,000 hectares in 2019;  farmers  have  been  less  exposed  to  dangerous  insecticides,  and  consumers have accepted this safer product. Other  countries  have  been  slow  to  adopt  this  technology  because  of  the  fear  of controversy surrounding GMO-biotechnology crops and opposition by \u201cgreen groups\u201d. And it is to the credit of Filipino scientists and regulators that they have finally accepted the scientific evidence and shown courage to approve this new eggplant variety, and give consumers a safer vegetable. Future Biotechnologies The  importance  of the  approval by  the Philippines of  Golden  Rice  and  Bt Eggplant cannot be understated. The Philippines was the first Asian country in 2000 to approve a  biotech  crop,  the  Bt  maize  for  planting  by  farmers. And  since  then  the  economic benefits to farmers, especially smallholder farmers have exceeded expectations, as studied by credible economists. It has drastically reduced the foreign exchange bill of importing maize to fuel the growing demand for animal feed. The Philippines was even able to export maize in one year. The  doomsayers  who  predicted  environmental  disaster  from  introducing  a  biotech crop  like  Bt  maize  into  the  environment  have  been  proven  wrong  as  the  fears  of upsetting biodiversity have not been evidenced. Neither has any of the concerns about animal and human safety been seen. Indeed the 20 years of biotech maize use around the world has only seen a yearly increase in the uptake by farmers, to the benefit of consumers through a reliable supply of an important animal feed (and human food in some countries). Moving Forward The latest report on food insecurity by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in 2021 (http://www.fao.org/3/cb4474en/online/cb4474en.html) shows that the Asian continent is still rife with hunger and malnutrition.

    "context": "COMMENTARY ON  20  FEBRUARY  2020,  ASEAN  and  China  held  the  first  Special  ASEAN-China Foreign Ministers\u2019 Meeting on COVID-19 in Vientiane, Laos that sought to coordinate a unified ASEAN-China response to the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic that now has all features of a global pandemic. During  the  meeting,  China\u2019s  Foreign  Minister  Wang  Yi  made  four  proposals  \u2014 enhance  inter-agency  response;  set-up  permanent  public  health  cooperation mechanisms; be prepared to lift trade and travel restrictions; and foster new areas of cooperation amid the epidemic. Wang\u2019s proposals were received positively by ASEAN counterparts. Factors Behind the Meeting According to the meeting\u2019s joint statement, ASEAN and China promised to increase information  sharing  and  communications,  strengthen  cooperation  mechanisms, expand  policy  dialogue,  build  disease  prevention  and  control  capacity,  support businesses  affected  by  the  epidemic,  \u201cmitigate  supply  chain  disruptions  of  urgent medical goods and promote research and development of medicines and vaccines\u201d. Some two months after the outbreak began, China finally held the first meeting with ASEAN, the largest multi-nation bloc in China\u2019s neighborhood. Although we are not sure why it took so long for China\u2019s foreign minister to meet ASEAN counterparts, the results of the meeting were clearly positive. Still, it is necessary for us to grasp the circumstances that led to the meeting, so we could  better  understand  the  future  trajectory  of  ASEAN-China  cooperation  in combating COVID-19. Two major factors contributed to the realisation of the meeting. One  deals  with  national  security  of  ASEAN  states,  the  other  is  mutual  economic interest. The Security Factor COVID-19  is  a  highly  contagious  virus  with  an  unpredictable  profile.  In  a  recent speech,  Chinese  President  Xi  Jinping  confirmed  that  COVID-19  \u201chas  the  fastest transmission, widest range of infection and has been the most difficult to prevent and control\u201d. Unlike SARS, the source and transmission patterns of COVID-19 have not been completely understood. Thus,  COVID-19  is  comparatively  more  difficult  to  contain.  The  surprise  rise  of infections in South Korea, Italy, and Iran of the past several days are testaments to mounting  challenges  in  global  containment  efforts.  So  far,  COVID-19  has  already surpassed SARS in infected cases and death toll, all within a shorter time frame. With  porous  borders  and  heavy  international  traffic,  Southeast  Asian  countries  are especially vulnerable to the epidemic, leading to a number of ASEAN countries taking strict protective measures, with Singapore, the Philippines, and Indonesia being the most stringent in limiting visitors with recent travel history to Mainland China. Currently, six out of 10 ASEAN states have reported COVID-19 cases, out of which Singapore has the  highest of 93 cases, of which 62 have fully recovered. With that being  said,  ASEAN  countries  cannot  return  to  normalcy  when  the  epicentre  of  the initial outbreak remains very much active and ASEAN states are helping themselves by contributing to China\u2019s containment effort. Mutual Economic Interest Besides  security,  common  economic  interest  also  brought  ASEAN  and  China together.  At  the  crossroads  of  international  commerce,  Southeast  Asia  is  a  main investment destination for China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). And in recent years trade  between  ASEAN  and  China  has  been  expanding  exponentially.  Merchandise trade with China reached US$479.4 billion in 2018, or 17.1 percent of ASEAN\u2019s total merchandise trade. In addition, China has been ASEAN\u2019s largest trade partner since 2009. In 2018, China provided  the  third-largest  amount  of  foreign  direct  investment  to  ASEAN  and  the country produced the largest number of tourists to four ASEAN countries. COVID-19 is extremely disruptive to commerce. Both China and ASEAN countries are forecasting much slower economic growth this year with billions of dollars in economic losses  due  to  disruption  in  trade,  travel,  and  investment.  According  to  Morgan Stanley\u2019s assessment, China\u2019s first quarter growth could slow to 3.5 percent if COVID- 19 is not properly contained. In the meantime, Singapore has downgraded its 2020 growth to between -0.5 percent and 1.5 percent, a reflection of regional ill fortunes. As commonly known, economic troubles could amplify problems in other sectors. Therefore, it is in the interest of both ASEAN and China to join hands and bring an end to the epidemic as soon as possible. Meeting\u2019s Impact on COVID-19 Containment While the Vientiane meeting ended on a high note with words of mutual support and confidence in overcoming difficulties together, President Xi struck quite a different tone to  Foreign  Minister  Wang\u2019s  promising  words.  Three  days  after  the  ASEAN-China meeting, Xi gave a speech calling the COVID-19 epidemic the \u201clargest public health emergency\u201d since the People\u2019s Republic\u2019s founding and called the crisis a \u201cbig test\u201d for the government. Xi\u2019s statement, in addition to rising infections in several countries, show that COVID- 19  will  have  lasting  global  impact  and  its  containment  demands  coordinated international action. For ASEAN countries, the Vientiane meeting is comparable to the April 2003 Bangkok meeting, when Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao met ASEAN counterparts and devised plans to jointly combat SARS. The Vientiane meeting could mark a new beginning for ASEAN-China public health cooperation. Besides  utilising  existing  mechanisms  such  as  ASEAN-China  Health  Ministers\u2019 Meeting and the ASEAN-China Senior Officials\u2019  Meeting on Health Development to \u201cfully  implement  the  ASEAN-China  MOU  on  Health  Cooperation  and  support  more mutually agreed cooperation projects\u201d, we will likely witness changes in three areas. Three Key Impacts First of all, according to the Chinese foreign minister, China seeks to hold a Special China-ASEAN  Leaders\u2019  Meeting  on  COVID-19,  in  addition  to  establishing  a  China- ASEAN  public  health  liaison  group,  and  reserve  centers  for  epidemic-control provisions. Thus, we will see the formation of new mechanisms in the coming months.",

During  the  meeting,  China\u2019s  Foreign  Minister  Wang  Yi  made  four  proposals  \u2014 enhance  inter-agency  response;  set-up  permanent  public  health  cooperation mechanisms; be prepared to lift trade and travel restrictions; and foster new areas of cooperation amid the epidemic. Wang\u2019s proposals were received positively by ASEAN counterparts. Factors Behind the Meeting According to the meeting\u2019s joint statement, ASEAN and China promised to increase information  sharing  and  communications,  strengthen  cooperation  mechanisms, expand  policy  dialogue,  build  disease  prevention  and  control  capacity,  support businesses  affected  by  the  epidemic,  \u201cmitigate  supply  chain  disruptions  of  urgent medical goods and promote research and development of medicines and vaccines\u201d. Some two months after the outbreak began, China finally held the first meeting with ASEAN, the largest multi-nation bloc in China\u2019s neighborhood. Although we are not sure why it took so long for China\u2019s foreign minister to meet ASEAN counterparts, the results of the meeting were clearly positive. Still, it is necessary for us to grasp the circumstances that led to the meeting, so we could  better  understand  the  future  trajectory  of  ASEAN-China  cooperation  in combating COVID-19. Two major factors contributed to the realisation of the meeting. One  deals  with  national  security  of  ASEAN  states,  the  other  is  mutual  economic interest. The Security Factor COVID-19  is  a  highly  contagious  virus  with  an  unpredictable  profile.  In  a  recent speech,  Chinese  President  Xi  Jinping  confirmed  that  COVID-19  \u201chas  the  fastest transmission, widest range of infection and has been the most difficult to prevent and control\u201d. Unlike SARS, the source and transmission patterns of COVID-19 have not been completely understood. Thus,  COVID-19  is  comparatively  more  difficult  to  contain.  The  surprise  rise  of infections in South Korea, Italy, and Iran of the past several days are testaments to mounting  challenges  in  global  containment  efforts.  So  far,  COVID-19  has  already surpassed SARS in infected cases and death toll, all within a shorter time frame. With  porous  borders  and  heavy  international  traffic,  Southeast  Asian  countries  are especially vulnerable to the epidemic, leading to a number of ASEAN countries taking strict protective measures, with Singapore, the Philippines, and Indonesia being the most stringent in limiting visitors with recent travel history to Mainland China. Currently, six out of 10 ASEAN states have reported COVID-19 cases, out of which Singapore has the  highest of 93 cases, of which 62 have fully recovered. With that being  said,  ASEAN  countries  cannot  return  to  normalcy  when  the  epicentre  of  the initial outbreak remains very much active and ASEAN states are helping themselves by contributing to China\u2019s containment effort. Mutual Economic Interest Besides  security,  common  economic  interest  also  brought  ASEAN  and  China together.  At  the  crossroads  of  international  commerce,  Southeast  Asia  is  a  main investment destination for China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). And in recent years trade  between  ASEAN  and  China  has  been  expanding  exponentially.  Merchandise trade with China reached US$479.4 billion in 2018, or 17.1 percent of ASEAN\u2019s total merchandise trade. In addition, China has been ASEAN\u2019s largest trade partner since 2009. In 2018, China provided  the  third-largest  amount  of  foreign  direct  investment  to  ASEAN  and  the country produced the largest number of tourists to four ASEAN countries. COVID-19 is extremely disruptive to commerce. Both China and ASEAN countries are forecasting much slower economic growth this year with billions of dollars in economic losses  due  to  disruption  in  trade,  travel,  and  investment.  According  to  Morgan Stanley\u2019s assessment, China\u2019s first quarter growth could slow to 3.5 percent if COVID- 19 is not properly contained. In the meantime, Singapore has downgraded its 2020 growth to between -0.5 percent and 1.5 percent, a reflection of regional ill fortunes. As commonly known, economic troubles could amplify problems in other sectors. Therefore, it is in the interest of both ASEAN and China to join hands and bring an end to the epidemic as soon as possible. Meeting\u2019s Impact on COVID-19 Containment While the Vientiane meeting ended on a high note with words of mutual support and confidence in overcoming difficulties together, President Xi struck quite a different tone to  Foreign  Minister  Wang\u2019s  promising  words.  Three  days  after  the  ASEAN-China meeting, Xi gave a speech calling the COVID-19 epidemic the \u201clargest public health emergency\u201d since the People\u2019s Republic\u2019s founding and called the crisis a \u201cbig test\u201d for the government. Xi\u2019s statement, in addition to rising infections in several countries, show that COVID- 19  will  have  lasting  global  impact  and  its  containment  demands  coordinated international action. For ASEAN countries, the Vientiane meeting is comparable to the April 2003 Bangkok meeting, when Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao met ASEAN counterparts and devised plans to jointly combat SARS. The Vientiane meeting could mark a new beginning for ASEAN-China public health cooperation. Besides  utilising  existing  mechanisms  such  as  ASEAN-China  Health  Ministers\u2019 Meeting and the ASEAN-China Senior Officials\u2019  Meeting on Health Development to \u201cfully  implement  the  ASEAN-China  MOU  on  Health  Cooperation  and  support  more mutually agreed cooperation projects\u201d, we will likely witness changes in three areas. Three Key Impacts First of all, according to the Chinese foreign minister, China seeks to hold a Special China-ASEAN  Leaders\u2019  Meeting  on  COVID-19,  in  addition  to  establishing  a  China- ASEAN  public  health  liaison  group,  and  reserve  centers  for  epidemic-control provisions.

    "context": "COMMENTARY THE  DEBATE  about  debt  pooling  among  the  Eurozone  has  haunted  the  single currency ever since it was first conceived. In 1998, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a champion of the Euro, promised a sceptical German public that a common currency would not lead to German liabilities for other economies\u2019 sovereign debt. But  as  the  COVID-19  crisis  hits,  some  southern  European  governments  demand precisely such trans-national liabilities. The Euro was always a political rather than an economic project, and as such, it always had two major flaws. The Euro\u2019s Birth Defect Firstly,  the  Eurozone  is  monetary  without  fiscal  union.  Monetary  policy  for  the Eurozone is set by the European Central Bank (ECB), while economic and fiscal policy is set on the national level. Such  disunion  is  not  sustainable  in  the  long-term  without  endless  redistribution  of wealth. This is particularly true if the difference in economic performance and fiscal discipline is as great as that in the Eurozone. Although a clear ruleset and monitoring mechanism exists to maintain the stability of the Euro exists, called the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), those rules are regularly broken  by  most  members  (including  Germany).  And  even  the  most  rigorous  of European  Union  (EU) rules,  such  as  its  competition  law  and  part  of  the  SGP,  were jettisoned immediately as COVID-19 hit Europe. Secondly, the Eurozone is an exclusive club within the EU. Not all EU members use the Euro, creating a two-tier organisation, and Eurozone members recurrently hold EU processes hostage to their monetary quarrels. From \u201cEurobonds\u201d to \u201cCoronabonds\u201d During the Eurozone debt crisis, highly indebted EU countries demanded \u201csolidarity\u201d in  the  form  of  collectivising  all  Eurozone  sovereign  debt  by  issuing  so-called Eurobonds. Quite rightly, Germany and other fiscally conservative Eurozone members responded with a clear \u201cNein\u201d, no chance. The idea behind Eurobonds is quite simple: All Eurozone countries pool their debt and raise  bonds  on  the  markets  to  borrow  at  much  lower  rates  than  highly  indebted individual countries could do unilaterally. The entire Eurozone, therefore, guarantees all Eurozone debt. This was supposed to stabilise the sovereign debt spiral in countries such as Portugal and Greece. The  catch  for  fiscally  more  disciplined  countries  is that  they  would  be  liable  should other  governments  default  on  their  debt  and  would  have  to  pick  up  the  bill  should others go bankrupt. Wisely,  Eurobonds  were  rejected  then,  and  monies  from  the  European  Stability Mechanism (ESM), the specifically created bailout mechanism, were used instead \u2013 with  severe  austerity  strings  attached  so  that  fiscally  unsound  countries  would  get excessive national spending in order and debt under control. Eurobonds 2.0 Make no mistake, the sovereign debt crisis never went away entirely and is about to return with a vengeance. Unfortunately, COVID-19 has hit Italy, the Eurozone\u2019s third- largest  economy,  particularly hard.  Italy\u2019s  sovereign  debt  already  is at  a  staggering 135%  of  GDP,  and  if  Italy  struggles,  the  entire  Eurozone  struggles.  The  Euro  and banking crisis could return more severe than ever before. On the back of COVID-19, Italy and others raise the issue of Eurobonds once again, only  for  them  to  be  dubbed  Coronabonds.  Despite  high  moral  pressure  on  less indebted countries to accept liability, governments must stand firm and refute any such attempt. Undoubtedly,  the  Eurozone  will  have  to  dig  deep  to  bail  out  the  post-COVID-19 economy  if  they  want  to  save  the  Euro  (and  there  is  no  doubt  on  that  front).  But Coronabonds are not necessary. Alternative Ways Out of the Crisis Europe\u2019s financial systems are  currently in much better shape than their healthcare systems. Italian and Spanish government debt is high but stable, and bond yields have come  down  to  acceptable  levels  since  2015,  and  neither  currently  have  disruptive financial problems. Especially in times of \u201cbearish\u201d stock-markets, government bonds are in demand. The  only  sound  argument  in  favour  of  Eurozone  bonds  is  forcing  ever  deeper European integration, and COVID-19 must not be misused to push such integration through the backdoor. The rise of populist parties was fed by the Eurozone crisis, and Eurobonds  will  add  substantial  momentum  to  those  movements  in  net-contributor countries like Germany and the Netherlands. Moreover, it is unforeseeable how these countries themselves will weather the storm, and  how  much  debt  they  will  have  to  raise  to  stabilise  their  own  economies.  In Germany,  additional  COVID-19  spending  is some  40%  of  its  entire  annual  budget; wholly  credit-financed  and  jettisoning  Berlin\u2019s  sacred  \u201cBlack-Zero\u201d,  its  balanced budget.",

Italian and Spanish government debt is high but stable, and bond yields have come  down  to  acceptable  levels  since  2015,  and  neither  currently  have  disruptive financial problems. Especially in times of \u201cbearish\u201d stock-markets, government bonds are in demand. The  only  sound  argument  in  favour  of  Eurozone  bonds  is  forcing  ever  deeper European integration, and COVID-19 must not be misused to push such integration through the backdoor. The rise of populist parties was fed by the Eurozone crisis, and Eurobonds  will  add  substantial  momentum  to  those  movements  in  net-contributor countries like Germany and the Netherlands. Moreover, it is unforeseeable how these countries themselves will weather the storm, and  how  much  debt  they  will  have  to  raise  to  stabilise  their  own  economies.  In Germany,  additional  COVID-19  spending  is some  40%  of  its  entire  annual  budget; wholly  credit-financed  and  jettisoning  Berlin\u2019s  sacred  \u201cBlack-Zero\u201d,  its  balanced budget.",
    "question": "5. How could the rise of populist parties be fueled by the introduction of Eurobonds and what are the potential consequences for net-contributor countries like Germany and the Netherlands?",
    "point_form_context": "1. The Eurozone has two major flaws: it is a monetary union without a fiscal union, and it is an exclusive club within the EU.\n2. The Eurozone debt crisis led to the proposal of Eurobonds, which were rejected in favor of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) with severe austerity strings attached.\n3. The sovereign debt crisis is about to return with the COVID-19 pandemic, and Italy and others are proposing Eurobonds (dubbed Coronabonds) to be liable for each other's debt.\n4. Germany and other fiscally conservative Eurozone members must stand firm and refute any attempt at Eurobonds to avoid undue liability and further integration.\n5. Alternative ways out of the crisis include improving financial systems and avoiding the misuse of COVID-19 to push European integration through the backdoor."
