    "question": "1. What are the potential reasons behind the failure of early warning systems to detect and respond to the COVID-19 outbreak?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "One potential reason behind the failure of early warning systems to detect and respond to the COVID-19 outbreak is a lack of data sharing and collaboration between countries. Many countries were slow to share data about the virus, leading to a lack of understanding and response on a global level. This was exacerbated by a lack of standardized reporting methods and a reluctance to share data due to concerns about proprietary information and intellectual property rights.",
      "Another reason is a lack of investment in public health systems, particularly in developing countries. Many countries do not have the capacity or resources to detect and respond to outbreaks like COVID-19. This was highlighted by the fact that many cases were initially misdiagnosed or went undetected, allowing the virus to spread before it was identified.",
      "Finally, there was a failure to recognize the potential for the virus to spread rapidly and globally. Early warning systems are designed to detect and respond to outbreaks quickly, but the speed of the COVID-19 outbreak outpaced many countries' ability to respond. This was due in part to a lack of understanding about the virus, as well as a failure to recognize the potential for it to become a global pandemic."

    "question": "2. How can cognitive biases affect the effectiveness of early warning systems in addressing infectious disease outbreaks?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "1. Cognitive biases can affect the effectiveness of early warning systems in addressing infectious disease outbreaks by impacting the decision-making processes of those responsible for managing and responding to the crisis. For instance, confirmation bias can lead to a failure to consider alternative explanations for the outbreak, while availability bias can result in an overemphasis on recent or highly visible cases (Cialdini, 2009).",
      "2. Cognitive biases can also lead to inefficient allocation of resources and a failure to prioritize the most critical issues. Anchoring bias, for example, can result in overreliance on initial impressions or estimates, which may not be accurate in the face of rapidly evolving circumstances (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).",
      "3. Additionally, failures in communication can arise when those responsible for disseminating information to the public have biases that prevent them from effectively conveying critical messages. This can result in public misinformation and a lack of trust in the system (Nelson & Simmons, 2006).",
      "In conclusion, cognitive biases can significantly undermine the effectiveness of early warning systems in addressing infectious disease outbreaks, and highlights the importance of addressing these biases in order to develop effective crisis management strategies (Lerner et al., 2015)."

By having access to better data, governments and organizations can make more informed decisions and take action sooner, which can help to contain the spread of a pandemic.",
      "Another claim is that governments and international organizations can improve their response to early warning systems by increasing transparency and communication with the public. This can help to build trust and encourage people to follow public health recommendations, which can also help to slow the spread of a pandemic. Governments should ensure that the information they provide is accurate and accessible to the public, and they should also be transparent about any actions they are taking to respond to a potential pandemic.",
      "Thirdly, governments and international organizations can improve their response to early warning systems by investing in public health infrastructure and preparedness.

    "question": "1. How does Russia's foreign policy platform, the Russia-India-China (RIC) triangle, factor into its role as an \"unofficial honest broker\" in Sino-Indian relations?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "Russia's foreign policy platform, the Russia-India-China (RIC) triangle, plays a significant role in its position as an \"unofficial honest broker\" in Sino-Indian relations. The RIC framework provides a distinctive platform for Russia to mediate between the two Asian giants, leveraging its historical ties, geopolitical interests, and cultural affinities with both India and China. The RIC mechanism also emphasizes multilateralism, which allows Russia to facilitate dialogue and communication between the two countries, while avoiding potential confrontations in the region.",
      "First and foremost, Russia's advantageous geographical location, with a long border with China and a growing partnership with India, enables it to act as an effective mediator. The RIC framework provides Russia with an opportunity to foster closeness and cooperation with both countries, while promoting peaceful negotiations and conflict resolution. The platform allows Russia to present its views, and propose solutions to the two nations, thus enhancing its credibility and reputation as an \"unofficial honest broker.\"",
      "Furthermore, Russia's historical ties with China and India offer a unique opportunity for mediation. Russia's relationship with China dates back to the ancient Silk Road, while its partnership with India can be traced back to the Soviet era. These historical connections have allowed Russia to develop a deep understanding of the cultural, economic, and political dynamics of both countries, and to exploit this knowledge to build trust, foster dialogue, and promote cooperation.",
      "In addition, given the strong cultural ties between Russia and both India and China, the RIC platform allows Russia to act as a cultural and intellectual bridge. The shared religious, social, and philosophical values between these countries provide a foundation to enhance mutual understanding, cooperation, and respect, which can help build trust, mitigate tensions and facilitate positive dialogue.",
      "In conclusion, Russia's foreign policy platform, the RIC triangle, plays a crucial role in its position as an \"unofficial honest broker\" between Sino-Indian relations. With its advantageous geographic position, historical ties, and cultural affinities with both countries, Russia has a unique opportunity to mediate conflicts, promote diplomatic dialogue, and facilitate cooperation between the two Asian powers."

    "question": "4. What role can social media platforms play in spreading misinformation during a public health crisis?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "1. Social media platforms play a significant role in spreading misinformation during public health crises as they provide a fast and wide-reaching platform for disseminating information. The speed at which misinformation can spread on these platforms can lead to confusion and panic, as incorrect information can quickly go viral and be shared by numerous users.",
      "2. Social media algorithms also contribute to the spread of misinformation during public health crises. These algorithms prioritize content that is likely to generate engagement, such as likes, shares, and comments. Misinformation often fits this criteria, as it is often sensational and emotionally charged, leading to a cycle of misinformation that is difficult to break without intervention.",
      "3. The complexity of social media also exacerbates the problem of misinformation during public health crises. Social media platforms are often used by a diverse range of users, including activists, health officials, and concerned citizens. This can lead to conflicting information and different narratives, making it difficult for individuals to discern the truth and furthering the spread of misinformation.",
      "In conclusion, social media platforms can play a significant role in spreading misinformation during public health crises. The speed, algorithms, and complexity of social media platforms contribute to the problem, making it essential for health officials and concerned citizens to take steps to combat the spread of misinformation and to promote accurate information during these crises."

      "The extent to which this will feature on the 2020 agenda will largely depend on either the restraint or assertiveness of China.",

      "Lastly, the behaviour of the United States is worth observing.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s engagement of ASEAN has been disappointingly low, and in 2020, the president is unlikely to attend the EAS, as it will coincide with the presidential elections.",
      "However, Washington may be incentivised to meet ASEAN leaders in a special US-ASEAN summit or otherwise, which would mitigate Trump\u2019s assaults on Asian multilateralism.",

    "question": "3. What are some of the challenges that Vietnam faces in its dual diplomatic responsibility as the chair of ASEAN and a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, and how does it plan to overcome them?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "One of the main challenges that Vietnam faces as both the chair of ASEAN and a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council is balancing its commitments to both organizations. As the chair of ASEAN, Vietnam is responsible for promoting regional cooperation and coordination among its fellow members. At the same time, as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, Vietnam is responsible for maintaining international peace and security. Striking a balance between these two responsibilities can be difficult, as they may at times require competing priorities or approaches.",
      "Another challenge that Vietnam faces in its dual diplomatic responsibility is navigating the complex and often contentious issues that are debated within both organizations. As the chair of ASEAN, Vietnam will need to work with its fellow members to address a range of regional issues, including the South China Sea disputes and the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Myanmar. At the same time, as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, Vietnam will need to engage with other member states on sensitive issues such as the ongoing conflict in Syria and the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea\u2019s nuclear program.",
      "Finally, Vietnam's dual diplomatic responsibility also presents a challenge in terms of resources and capacity. Balancing the demands of two such important organizations can be challenging for any country, especially for a developing country like Vietnam. Vietnam will have to make sure that it has the necessary staff, expertise, and funding to fulfill its obligations and make the most of its role as the chair of ASEAN and non-permanent member of the UN Security Council."

    "close_book_answer": [
      "The curriculum for the Bakamla training center on Batam Island is determined through a collaborative process involving multiple stakeholders, including industry partners, educators, and government agencies. However, concerns have been raised regarding the quality of the curriculum, as well as the lack of representation from the local community.",
      "One concern is that the training center may prioritize the needs of the industry over the needs of the local community. As a result, the curriculum may not address the skills and knowledge that are most relevant to the local job market. Additionally, the lack of representation from the local community in the curriculum development process may result in a curriculum that is not culturally appropriate or relevant to the local context.",
      "Another concern is the potential for the training center to perpetuate existing inequalities, rather than promote greater equality. For example, the training center may not be accessible to all members of the local community, particularly those who are marginalized or underrepresented. This could reinforce existing social and economic inequalities, and exclude certain individuals from accessing the opportunities provided by the training center.",
      "Overall, it is essential to ensure that the curriculum for the Bakamla training center is developed in a collaborative, inclusive, and transparent manner, and that it addresses the needs and priorities of the local community. This will require ongoing engagement and dialogue with stakeholders, as well as a commitment to addressing any concerns or challenges that arise throughout the process."

    "close_book_answer": [
      "One of the key roles the US Coast Guard (USCG) plays in the training and deployment of officers at the Bakamla training center on Batam Island is providing specialized training in maritime security and safety operations. This cooperation agreement between Indonesia and the US involves exchanging knowledge and expertise in areas such as search and rescue, maritime law enforcement, and anti-piracy operations. The USCG will also share its best practices and techniques with Indonesian coast guard personnel, enhancing their capabilities in these critical areas.",
      "However, there are also challenges associated with this arrangement. One of the main challenges is language barriers. The USCG personnel stationed at the training center may not be proficient in the local language, making communication with their Indonesian counterparts difficult. Additionally, cultural differences may also pose challenges in terms of understanding the local context and customs. The USCG may need to adapt its training methods to better match the cultural and linguistic norms of the Indonesian coast guard personnel.",
      "Another challenge is the potential for political tensions between the US and Indonesia to affect the training and deployment of officers. Political changes in either country could lead to a change in priorities, funding, or cooperation agreements. This could disrupt the training programs and hinder the deployment of officers, affecting the effectiveness of the Indonesian coast guard.",
      "Finally, the USCG may face challenges in transferring its expertise and knowledge to its Indonesian counterparts. Although both parties may have similar goals in terms of maritime security and safety, their methods and approaches may differ. The USCG may need to spend additional time and resources in adapting its training programs to better suit the needs and cultural context of the Indonesian coast guard.",
      "Overall, the USCG's role in the training and deployment of officers at the Bakamla training center on Batam Island is crucial for enhancing maritime security and safety in the region. However, challenges associated with language barriers, cultural differences, political tensions, and knowledge transfer must be addressed in order to ensure the success of this cooperation agreement."

      "The temporary closure of mosques in Singapore and other countries highlights the critical role that religious authorities play in ensuring the safety and security of their communities. In order to effectively address concerns related to public health and safety, religious authorities must be proactive and courageous in making timely and accurate decisions.",
      "Firstly, the temporary closure of mosques in Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemic was an example of religious authorities taking a proactive approach to ensure the safety of their congregants. By implementing this measure before mass gatherings became a significant issue, religious authorities demonstrated their commitment to public health and safety.",
      "Secondly, the decision to temporarily close mosques required courage and a willingness to confront criticism from the community. This decision was not made lightly, as it was a significant departure from traditional practices and revered religious customs. By showing boldness, religious authorities were able to mitigate potential risks associated with crowded gatherings and prevent the spread of the virus.",
      "Thirdly, the temporary closure of mosques serves as a reminder that religious authorities must always prioritize the well-being of their communities over religious customs and traditions. In times of crisis, it is crucial that religious authorities are able to balance their commitment to their faith with the need to make decisions that are in the best interest of their community.",
      "In summary, the temporary closure of mosques in Singapore and other countries demonstrates the need for religious authorities to be proactive and courageous in making decisions that are timely and accurate. This approach ensures the safety and security of their communities and prioritizes the well-being of their congregants over religious customs and traditions."

This is a progressive stance that promotes unity and understanding, rather than division and exclusion.",
      "Lastly, the fatwa demonstrates the community's commitment to empowering women and supporting their rights. By recognizing the importance of women's participation in mosque governance, the community is taking a stand against gender inequality and supporting women's empowerment. This is a progressive stance that reflects the community's commitment to social justice and human rights, and it sets a positive example for other communities to follow."

With its emphasis on reason, justice, and the best interests of society, Sharia law is equipped to address the diverse needs and concerns of contemporary Muslims.",
      "One of the key advantages of the flexibility of Sharia law is that it allows Muslim jurists to interpret and apply Islamic law in a way that is relevant and meaningful to the needs of modern society. This is particularly important given the vast cultural, social, and political diversity that exists among Muslims around the world. By taking into account the unique circumstances of different Muslim communities, jurists are able to develop solutions that are tailored to the challenges and opportunities that they face. This approach promotes social and economic development, promotes human rights, and encourages peaceful coexistence with others.",
      "Furthermore, the flexibility of Sharia law enables jurists to address salient issues related to contemporary Muslims, such as economic justice, political participation, and social harmony. For instance, in the area of finance, jurists can develop solutions that promote equitable distribution and fair trade practices. In the realm of political participation, jurists can provide guidance on the responsibilities and rights of citizens, including the importance of voting and civic engagement. And in the context of social harmony, jurists can promote interfaith dialogue and understanding, and encourage respect for diversity and human dignity.",
      "In conclusion, the flexibility of Sharia law is a critical factor that enables Muslim jurists to provide practical and appropriate guidance to Muslims in different contexts and challenges. It allows for the application of Islamic law in a way that is relevant and meaningful to the needs of modern society, while addressing salient issues related to contemporary Muslims. By doing so, Sharia law promotes social and economic development, promotes human rights, and encourages peaceful coexistence with others."

They have a significant influence on their communities and can disseminate important health information to their followers, encouraging them to take necessary precautions to prevent the spread of the virus. They can also provide emotional and spiritual support to individuals and families affected by the pandemic, helping them cope with the fear and uncertainty that comes with this crisis.",
      "2. To work hand-in-hand with health authorities, religious authorities need to be informed about the latest scientific research and guidelines on preventing the spread of COVID-19. They can then relay this information to their followers in a way that is clear, concise, and culturally sensitive. Collaborating with health authorities can also enable religious authorities to identify and address misinformation and rumors about the virus, which can hinder efforts to contain its spread.",
      "3. It is important that religious authorities emphasize the importance of individual and community responsibility in preventing the spread of COVID-19. This includes enforcing quarantine and social distancing measures, getting vaccinated, and practicing good hygiene. They can also promote social connectedness while minimizing the risk of transmission by organizing virtual prayer services and other community events. By working together, religious authorities and health authorities can effectively address the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and ensure the health and well-being of their communities."

    "question": "1. How did Lee Kuan Yew's view of Singapore's vulnerability shape the policies he developed to ensure the country's survival and success?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "Lee Kuan Yew, the founding father of modern Singapore, was deeply aware of his country's vulnerability due to its small size, limited natural resources, and location in a volatile region. He believed that Singapore's survival and success depended on creating a stable and competitive economy, building a strong and educated population, and fostering strategic alliances with neighboring countries. This view shaped his policies in several ways.",
      "Firstly, Lee Kuan Yew focused on developing a competitive economic system to diversify Singapore's economy and attract foreign investment, thereby creating job opportunities and wealth for the local population. He implemented policies such as liberalization, deregulation, and privatization, which led to rapid economic growth and transformed Singapore into a thriving financial and technological hub.",
      "Secondly, he prioritized education as a crucial factor in creating a skilled and knowledgeable workforce. He invested in creating a world-class education system, emphasizing math and science, and encouraged a culture of learning and innovation. This policy has led to a highly literate and educated population, essential for Singapore's future growth and development.",
      "Lastly, he sought to build strategic alliances with neighboring countries to increase Singapore's influence and security in the region. He pursued diplomatic relations with key countries, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, and made efforts to improve trade and investment ties with China, Japan, and the United States. This strategy has allowed Singapore to maintain a stable environment for its economic and social development.",
      "In conclusion, Lee Kuan Yew's view of Singapore's vulnerability played a crucial role in shaping his policies to ensure the country's survival and success. His focus on economic competitiveness, education, and strategic alliances has laid the foundation for Singapore's continued growth and prosperity in the future."

From these experiences, he gained a deep understanding of the importance of effective leadership and decision-making. He learned that strong leadership is crucial for a country's stability and prosperity, and that decisive action must be taken to address any issues that arise.",

He believed that a clear and concise vision was necessary for effective leadership and decision-making. This vision had to be communicated to the people in a way that was understandable and inspiring. He also understood the importance of having a strong and capable team in place to help implement this vision.",

He recognized that a divided society is a vulnerable society, and that social cohesion was crucial for a country's stability and success. He worked tirelessly to promote racial and religious harmony in Singapore, and encouraged all citizens to come together and work towards a common goal.",
      "Finally, Lee Kuan Yew learned the value of pragmatism in leadership. He believed that leaders must make tough decisions in order to move the country forward, even if these decisions were unpopular. He was willing to take risks and make difficult choices in order to achieve the best possible outcome for Singapore. His pragmatic approach to leadership, combined with his clear vision and strong unity, helped to shape Singapore into the prosperous and stable nation it is today."

This can lead to a greater understanding and acceptance of different viewpoints, reducing the potential for conflict and promoting social cohesion.",
      "Another way to balance nationalism and cosmopolitanism is through policy. Governments can create policies that promote diversity and inclusivity, such as implementing anti-discrimination laws and encouraging the hiring of a diverse workforce. This can help create a more equitable society where everyone feels valued and has a voice.",
      "Finally, balancing nationalism and cosmopolitanism can also involve promoting communication and dialogue between different groups. By encouraging people to engage in open and respectful discussions, we can foster a greater sense of understanding and empathy, leading to greater social cohesion. Ultimately, achieving social cohesion requires a combination of education, policy, and dialogue to balance the competing values of nationalism and cosmopolitanism."

    "question": "3. What are the challenges facing the formation of a stable and multi-ethnic permanent coalition in the opposition?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "1. One of the main challenges facing the formation of a stable and multi-ethnic permanent coalition in the opposition is the lack of trust and coordination between various opposition parties. Each party has its own interests and ideologies, and this creates difficulties in reaching a consensus on key issues. As a result, it becomes challenging to form a united front against the ruling party.",
      "2. Another challenge is the absence of a shared vision and strategic goals among opposition parties. With no clear direction and common goals, it is difficult to galvanize support and momentum towards creating a coalition government. Additionally, internal rivalries and personal animosity between opposition leaders can hinder the formation of a strong and cohesive coalition.",
      "3. Lastly, electoral systems can impact the likelihood of opposition parties forming a stable and multi-ethnic coalition. In many cases, first-past-the-post electoral systems tend to benefit the ruling party by concentrating power and resources. This can make it challenging for opposition parties to win enough seats to form a coalition government, as they must overcome significant structural barriers."

    "question": "4. How has the two-coalition system in Malaysia evolved over time, and what factors have contributed to its instability?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The two-coalition system in Malaysia refers to the alternation of power between the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, consisting primarily of the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), and the Pakatan Rakyat (PR) coalition, which includes the Democratic Action Party (DAP), Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR), and the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS). Over time, this system has undergone several changes, contributing to its instability.",
      "Firstly, the 2018 general election saw the defeat of the BN coalition, which had ruled Malaysia for over 60 years. This was a significant change, as the BN had always been able to rally its partners and maintain power through strategic alliances. The coalition's weakening was due to a combination of factors, including internal divisions, corruption scandals, and the rise of social media, which allowed opposition parties to mobilize more effectively.",
      "Secondly, the PR coalition also suffered from internal divisions, which weakened its ability to form a united front against the BN. This was particularly evident in the 1999 and 2004 elections, where the coalition failed to capitalize on public dissatisfaction with the ruling government due to infighting and lack of clear leadership. In addition, the inclusion of PAS, which has a distinct agenda and ideology, created difficulties in forging alliances with other parties in the coalition.",
      "Thirdly, the 2018 general election ushered in the formation of Pakatan Harapan (PH), which included the PR coalition parties, along with a new component, the Malaysian United Indigenous Party (BERSATU). While the coalition was able to win power, its internal dynamics have remained uncertain, with reported rifts and power struggles between its leaders. This instability has raised concerns about the coalition's ability to govern effectively and deliver on its promises to the people.",
      "In conclusion, the two-coalition system in Malaysia has undergone several changes over time, contributing to its instability. The defeat of the BN, internal divisions within the PR coalition and the PR coalition transformation into PH due to the increase of internal divisions and power struggles led to an uncertain political scenario. The evolution of the two-coalition system in Malaysia is a reflection of the country's complex political landscape and the challenges faced by its political parties in forming stable and effective alliances to govern the country."

      "IN THE latest survey results released by pollster Invoke, 51% of Malaysians polled in February 2021 were not sure which party to vote for if the election was called then, while another 17% declined to answer.",
      "Of the remaining 32%, half (16%) chose Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin\u2019s Perikatan Nasional (PN) while Barisan Nasional (BN), Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) and Pakatan Harapan (PH) enjoyed pathetic support of 8%, 4% and 3% respectively.",
      "The low support for all parties reflects voters\u2019 disillusion and frustration with the rapid political changes that have taken place since 2015, peaked in 2018 with the ouster of BN followed by the collapse of the PH government 22 months later.",
      "Malaysia\u2019s Permanent Coalitions: Fading Out? When Muhyiddin assumed power in March 2021, PN then was meant to be a grand coalition of Malay and native parties including his Malaysian United Indigenous Party (Bersatu), United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), PAS and the ex-BN Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS).",
      "Now mainly the pact of Bersatu and PAS, PN would be challenged by both PH, the official opposition, and an UMNO-led BN in the next election.",
      "UMNO sets its goals to annihilate Bersatu, its splinter formed in 2016 and home to UMNO\u2019s 15 defected parliamentarians.",
      "At the heart of realignments is the fading out of permanent coalitions, the only way of multi-ethnic, multiparty power-sharing that Malaysians have known since independence.",
      "In countries where no one party can win a simple majority in the parliament, coalitions are commonly formed to ensure political inclusion and stability.",
      "But most of these coalitions are formed after election, negotiated based on seat strength and meant to last for only the parliament\u2019s term.",
      "Coalition partners are to contest against each other in the next election and which parties would form the next coalition government depends on parties\u2019 new parliamentary strength.",
      "Political Inclusion and Stability In permanent coalitions, parties stick to each other before, during and after elections.",
      "Not only do they not contest against each other, they try to pool support for each other.",

      "The idea of permanent coalition was introduced in Malaysia by circumstance.",
      "In 1952, UMNO faced a crucial challenge by its multi-ethnic splinter Independence of Malaya Party (IMP) led by its founder president Dato\u2019 Onn Jaafar in Kuala Lumpur\u2019s inaugural municipal election.",
      "An ad-hoc and local electoral pact between UMNO and the then Malayan Chinese Association (MCA) was rewarded with a landslide, soon giving birth to the Alliance which was subsequently joined by the then Malayan Indian Congress (MIC).",
      "Against the background of a Chinese-dominant communist insurgency, a permanent coalition with parties representing different ethnic groups was seen by both the British and Malayans as the only guarantee of political inclusion and stability.",
      "The Alliance model was so dominant that it was copied in Sabah and Sarawak by the local parties on the eve of Malaysia\u2019s formation.",
      "To reduce political competition, Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak merged the three regional Alliance and co-opted opposition parties including PAS into the enlarged coalition of BN in 1974.",
      "This idea was eventually copied by the opposition in 1990 after UMNO\u2019s schism between Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and his former finance minister Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah.",

      "A Two-Coalition System? Modelling on the British two-party system, a system of two multi-ethnic and centrist permanent coalitions was seen as the only way to dislodge UMNO-BN.",
      "Instead of PAS and DAP attacking BN from the ethnic flanks accusing UMNO and MCA as sell-outs of their respective community, an opposition united front induced their moderation with the prospect of winning power.",
      "The \u201ctwo-coalition system\u201d, however, had a friend and foe in the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) electoral system.",
      "While it encouraged parties to pool votes to win ethnically mixed constituencies, it also overly weakened the loser between the two permanent coalitions that their communal components were tempted to return to their ethnic or regional flanks.",
      "This resulted in the collapse of Razaleigh\u2019s united front, followed by Barisan Alternatif (BA), Pakatan Rakyat (PR) and ultimately BN after its ousters in 2018.",
      "In the first three episodes, PAS\u2019 push for harsh Hudud punishments in PAS-administered states prompted DAP to break ties.",
      "The two-coalition project was rescued by UMNO\u2019s successive schisms, first between Mahathir Mohamad and his deputy Anwar Ibrahim who led BA and PR, then between Prime Minister Najib Razak and Mahathir since 2015.",
      "Najib successfully drew PAS out and changed the opposition coalitions\u2019 formula of an UMNO splinter \u2014 S46 and subsequently PKR \u2014 leading PAS and DAP.",
      "The 2018 election was fought between BN, PAS and PH which contained two UMNO splinter parties \u2014 PKR and Bersatu \u2014 and DAP and PAS\u2019 splinter Amanah.",
      "When BN disintegrated within months after its defeat due to exodus of East Malaysian parties and defection of UMNO parliamentarians, UMNO and PAS formalised their pact to take on the then Mahathir-led, multiethnic PH, which they accused of betraying the Malays.",

    "question": "5. What are the potential implications of a hung parliament in the next election for the future of political inclusion and stability in Malaysia?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "A hung parliament in the next election could have several implications for the future of political inclusion and stability in Malaysia. First, it could lead to political instability as coalition-building negotiations and horse-trading might take a long time, delaying the formation of a new government and causing uncertainty in policy-making. Additionally, it could also result in gridlock in Parliament, making it difficult to pass legislation and address the needs of the people.",
      "Moreover, a hung parliament could also affect the future of political inclusion in Malaysia. A lack of clear majority could result in a perceived lack of legitimacy in government and could further alienate certain groups, such as the opposition and minority groups. This could lead to further political polarization and increased division among the population, with potential for social and political unrest.",
      "On the other hand, a hung parliament could also potentially lead to a more inclusive and collaborative government, as parties would need to work together to form a government and pass legislation. This could lead to a more representative and responsive government that is more inclined to address the needs of all citizens, regardless of their political affiliation.",
      "Overall, a hung parliament in the next election could have both positive and negative implications for the future of political inclusion and stability in Malaysia, depending on how it is managed and the decisions made by the political parties involved. It is important for all parties to work towards a collaborative and inclusive government that represents the needs and wants of all citizens."

    "close_book_answer": [
      "ASEAN can play a crucial role in promoting transparency and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines in the region. Firstly, ASEAN can encourage member states to make vaccine distribution plans public and transparent so that citizens can have access to accurate information on vaccine availability, timing, and prioritization criteria. This would help in building trust and reducing mistrust and suspicions surrounding the vaccine distribution process.",
      "Secondly, ASEAN can facilitate cooperation and coordination among member states to ensure that vaccines are distributed in an equitable manner. This involves developing a common framework or guidelines for vaccine distribution that takes into consideration the needs of vulnerable groups, such as low-income households, elderly, and individuals with underlying medical conditions. ASEAN can also share best practices and lessons learned among member states to improve vaccine distribution efficiency and effectiveness.",
      "Lastly, ASEAN can advocate for transparency and accountability in vaccine distribution at the global level. This involves working with international organizations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), to ensure that vaccine manufacturers are held accountable for meeting their production and distribution targets. ASEAN can also encourage member states to engage in global vaccine distribution negotiations to ensure that the voices of developing countries are heard and taken into consideration.",
      "In summary, ASEAN can play a significant role in promoting transparency and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines in the region. By fostering a culture of transparency and accountability, ASEAN can help ensure that COVID-19 vaccines are distributed in a fair and equitable manner, benefiting all citizens in ASEAN countries."

    "question": "3. What role does nationalism play in international trade negotiations, and how does it affect the outcome of trade agreements?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "Nationalism can play a significant role in international trade negotiations as it often influences a country's bargaining position and policies. In some cases, nationalism can lead to protectionist measures, such as tariffs and subsidies, which can make trade more difficult and less beneficial for all involved parties. For instance, a country may choose to protect its domestic industries by imposing high tariffs on imports, which can lead to retaliation from other countries and a decrease in overall trade.",
      "Furthermore, nationalism can also influence a country's position on certain issues, such as intellectual property rights or labor standards. A country may prioritize its own interests over those of other nations, leading to negotiations that are more contentious and less likely to result in a mutually beneficial agreement. For instance, a country may insist on stronger intellectual property rights protections, which may be beneficial for its domestic industries but could lead to difficulties for other countries that rely on affordable access to certain goods.",
      "However, it's important to note that nationalism can also have positive effects on trade negotiations. For example, nationalism can lead to a greater emphasis on domestic industries, which can lead to increased employment and economic growth. Additionally, nationalism can give countries the confidence and motivation to negotiate more aggressively, leading to better outcomes for their citizens.",
      "In conclusion, nationalism can have both positive and negative effects on international trade negotiations and the outcome of trade agreements. It can influence a country's bargaining position, policies, and priorities, but it can also lead to greater domestic economic growth and a more assertive negotiating stance. As such, it is important for countries to carefully consider the role of nationalism in their trade policies and negotiations in order to achieve the best possible outcomes for their citizens."

    "close_book_answer": [
      "4. Achieving first-best outcomes in trade through international cooperation requires a collective effort from all involved parties, including governments, international organizations, and the private sector. One key challenge in this regard is the difficulty in reaching a consensus on the rules and regulations governing international trade. Countries may have different interests and agendas, making it difficult to reach an agreement on issues such as tariffs, trade barriers, and subsidies.",
      "Another challenge is the lack of enforcement mechanisms for existing trade agreements and regulations. Even when countries agree to certain rules, there is still a risk that some will not comply, leading to a loss of trust and a breakdown in cooperation. This can be addressed through the establishment of strong institutions and the creation of incentives for compliance.",
      "Finally, the international community must take into account the effects of trade policies on marginalized groups such as small-scale farmers and workers in developing countries. While increased trade can bring benefits, it can also lead to displacement and economic hardship for those who are not able to compete with larger and more efficient producers. Efforts must therefore be made to ensure that the benefits of trade are shared fairly and that support is provided to those who are negatively impacted.",
      "In order to achieve first-best outcomes in trade, the international community must work together to address these challenges and promote a fair and equitable trading system that benefits all.

      "WHATEVER THE shortcomings of the body of knowledge produced by the field of Economics, there is wide consensus among economists that removing barriers to international trade will benefit all countries in the aggregate.",
      "While it is true that not necessarily every single person in every single country will see an improvement in economic position, each country that liberalises its international trade regime could expect to improve its economic position in the aggregate.",
      "With the economic gain, the population of the country could collectively choose, if it so wished, to compensate those citizens that might have been set back by the process of liberalisation.",
      "Of course, in practice this does not necessarily happen; therein lies the heart of the challenge of the liberalisation of international trade: it is not an economic issue but rather one of political economy.",
      "How do we distribute the gains from trade to ensure universal support for liberalising trade? National Interest vs International Cooperation National policy, and by extension the \u2018national interest\u2019, on international trade is generally the outcome of the battle between winners and losers from trade measures.",
      "This imbues trade negotiations with a transactional and positional quality.",
      "Trade negotiators are incentivised to focus on not just what they can get for \u2018winners\u2019 but also how they might protect \u2018losers\u2019.",
      "Since it is not possible for every single country to get something without giving anything away, trade negotiations tend to become exactly that: a negotiation over what a country has to give away in order to get something.",
      "This institutional effect of domestic politics is sometimes compounded by the systemic effects of international politics that train policy makers to focus on relative gains (who gets what? will I get more than my rivals?).",
      "As a result, while economists emphasise the collective benefit of international trade, the policy makers and trade negotiators of most countries tend to approach international trade in a transactional and competitive manner.",
      "This tension between the shared benefits of an open, rules-based trading system and narrow national-interest is a long-standing feature of the international trade system.",
      "It is the classic face-off between international cooperation (or multilateralism) vs nationalism that has coloured virtually all facets of the trade regime and is often the underlying reason for the difficulty with making progress in international trade negotiations.",
      "Mercantilism in the WTO The history of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) since it was established in the mid-1990s is a vivid example of this dynamic.",
      "One of the key roles, if not the main role, of the WTO is to facilitate trade liberalisation, mainly through trade negotiations.",
      "However, the primary set of trade negotiations sponsored under the WTO, known as the Doha Round, was ultimately acknowledged to be dead after 14 years of discussions when it was buried under the inability to confer market access that largely pitted developed countries with less developed ones, all of whom focussed more on their respective national, rather than joint, interests.",
      "While an agreement on trade facilitation and one on government procurement were completed under the banner of the WTO, both are narrow in subject matter and the latter also narrow in terms of number signatories which reflect the challenge of securing wide international cooperation.",
      "More recently, the Appellate Body that is part of the WTO\u2019s dispute settlement system was rendered inoperative from December 2019 onwards because the United States unilaterally withheld support for the appointment of new members to the Body as it felt that the implementation of the system no longer served its national interest.",
      "The inability of members of the WTO to forge new trade outcomes on a multilateral basis, that is, in a way that includes all members of the WTO, has prompted member economies to seek unilateral, bilateral, regional and/or plurilateral solutions.",
      "The growth of regional trade agreements exploded in the period after the WTO was established.",
      "More dramatically were the trade wars initiated and unilateral trade measures adopted by President Donald Trump.",
      "These developments have cumulatively prompted many to question the fate and on-going relevance of economic multilateralism in recent years.",
      "The Search for First Best Outcomes This brings us back to our starting point.",
      "The demise of multilateralism in international trade might not be such a terrible thing except that there is near universal agreement that freer trade achieved through multilateral approaches would result in first-best outcomes.",
      "Anything else would lead to fragmented and less good outcomes.",
      "Recent measures related to COVID-vaccines offer a good example.",
      "In an ideal world, international cooperation would result in orderly supply of inputs to maximise the production of vaccines that are then distributed around the world to ensure that individuals are vaccinated according to universally agreed ranking of priority.",
      "Instead, nationalistic measures have resulted in disrupted production of vaccines, unproductive (and arguably unfair) hoarding of vaccines and the distribution of vaccines not according to need but instead wealth.",
      "These nationalistic measures might benefit a small handful of countries in the short-term, but it will leave the entire world much poorer and at continued risk of the virus.",
      "They will arguably also ultimately harm the small handful of countries that have adopted these measures.",
      "As the world slowly struggles to emerge out of the fog of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been a number of seminars, workshops and conferences on economic multilateralism in recent months that appear to reflect anxieties about the state of international economic cooperation.",
      "As the world ponders a post-pandemic economic future, it would be good if policymakers could heed the lesson of the virtue of international cooperation on trade (and more generally, economic) policies, exercise leadership at the domestic level and overcome their nationalistic urges at the international level.",
      "Let economic multilateralism, and not nationalism, live."
    ],
    "question": "5. What are some examples of how nationalistic measures in trade have led to negative consequences, and how can policymakers avoid these outcomes in the future?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "1. One negative consequence of nationalistic measures in trade is the rise of protectionism. When countries restrict imports or impose tariffs on foreign goods, it can lead to retaliation from other countries and a decrease in trade overall. For example, the trade war between the United States and China in 2018 resulted in both countries imposing tariffs on each other's goods, leading to decreased trade and negative impacts on their respective economies. To avoid this outcome, policymakers should focus on finding a balance between protecting domestic industries and promoting international trade. This can be achieved through negotiations and agreements that promote free trade, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO).",
      "2. Another negative consequence of nationalistic measures in trade is the potential for economic isolationism. When countries focus solely on protecting their own interests, they can miss out on opportunities for growth and development. For instance, if a country imposes high tariffs on imported goods, it may make those goods more expensive for consumers, leading them to seek alternatives from other countries. This can result in a loss of market share for domestic producers and a decrease in economic growth. To avoid this outcome, policymakers should consider the long-term effects of their decisions and weigh the benefits and drawbacks of protectionism.",
      "3. Lastly, nationalistic measures in trade can also lead to geopolitical tensions and conflict. When countries pursue protectionist policies, it can lead to a breakdown in diplomatic relations and a decline in trust among nations. For example, the United States' withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement in 2017 was met with criticism and condemnation from other countries, leading to a decline in international cooperation. To avoid this outcome, policymakers should prioritize diplomacy and engage in international cooperation to address shared challenges, such as climate change and economic development."

      "Firstly, technology convergence has changed the way we interact with each other and communicate. With the advent of social media and messaging apps, people can stay connected to their loved ones and colleagues regardless of their physical location. This has blurred the lines between personal and professional lives, leading to changes in social norms and conventions.",

    "question": "2. How do governments shape the way technological innovation intersects with social structures through investments, policy incentives, and regulation?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "A potential response to the discussion question about how governments shape the way technological innovation intersects with social structures through investments, policy incentives, and regulation is as follows:",
      "Claim 1: Governments can shape the direction of technological innovation by making strategic investments in research and development. For example, a government could invest in research focused on renewable energy sources, which would encourage the development of new, clean technologies that could potentially reduce the nation's carbon footprint. Similarly, a government could invest in biotechnology research, which could lead to the development of new medical treatments or therapies. By making these strategic investments, governments can shape the direction of technological innovation and help to drive progress in key areas.",
      "Claim 2: Governments can also use policy incentives to encourage technological innovation and social change. For example, a government could offer tax credits to businesses that invest in green technologies or provide grants to researchers working on cutting-edge biotechnology projects. These policy incentives can help to reduce the financial risks associated with investing in innovative technologies, making it more likely that they will be developed and brought to market. By providing these incentives, governments can help to foster technological innovation and encourage social change.",
      "Claim 3: Governments can use regulation to shape the way technological innovation intersects with social structures. For example, a government could regulate the use of certain technologies to ensure that they do not have negative impacts on society or the environment. This could include regulations around the use of social media, data privacy, or the disposal of electronic waste. By setting clear guidelines and standards, governments can help to shape the way that technological innovation intersects with social structures and ensure that it is developed in a responsible and sustainable manner."

How can responsible innovation be carried out in accordance with the three governmental responsibilities of setting long-term research priorities, creating the favourable conditions for invention and deployment, and managing ethical and social aspects including potential abuses of technology?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "In order to carry out responsible innovation, governments have three key responsibilities: setting long-term research priorities, creating favourable conditions for invention and deployment, and managing ethical and social aspects including potential abuses of technology.",
      "Firstly, governments must set long-term research priorities that align with the needs and goals of society, taking into account the potential benefits and risks of emerging technologies. This involves collaborating with stakeholders from various sectors to identify areas where research is most needed, and allocating resources accordingly.",
      "Secondly, governments must create the conditions for innovation and deployment by providing support for R&D, encouraging collaboration between stakeholders, and addressing barriers to entry for new technologies. This involves creating regulatory frameworks that promote innovation while also ensuring that technologies are developed and deployed in a responsible manner.",
      "Lastly, governments must manage ethical and social aspects of technology, including potential abuses, by establishing ethical standards and guidelines that promote responsible use and deployment of emerging technologies. This involves monitoring and enforcing these standards, as well as engaging with communities and stakeholders to ensure that the benefits of innovation are shared equitably.",
      "In summary, responsible innovation requires close collaboration between governments, industry, and civil society, and a commitment to developing and deploying technologies in a way that aligns with the needs and values of society. By fulfilling their responsibilities in setting research priorities, creating conditions for innovation and deployment, and managing ethical and social aspects, governments can ensure that innovation serves the public interest and contributes to a more inclusive and sustainable future."

    "close_book_answer": [
      "The long-term negative social impacts of mutual surveillance during the pandemic could lead to a breakdown of trust in social relationships, as individuals may become hesitant to engage in any behavior that could be interpreted as suspicious or risky. This could lead to a culture of fear and mistrust, where individuals are unwilling to engage in social activities or even interact with others due to concerns about being surveilled or judged. Furthermore, the prevalence of mutual surveillance could create a sense of isolation and disconnection among individuals, who may feel like they are under constant scrutiny and judgement from others.",
      "Additionally, mutual surveillance could exacerbate existing social inequalities, particularly for marginalized communities. Those who are already suspicious of authority, such as communities of color, immigrants, and the LGBTQ+ community, may be more likely to experience negative consequences of mutual surveillance, such as wrongful accusations, racial profiling, or discrimination. This could further strengthen existing biases and stereotypes, leading to a more fragmented and divided society.",
      "In conclusion, the long-term negative social impacts of mutual surveillance during the pandemic could result in a breakdown of trust, a culture of fear, and increased social isolation. Furthermore, it could exacerbate existing social inequalities and biases, leading to a more fragmented and divided society."

      "Trust as a Resource However, the defence of mutual surveillance as a matter of utility obscures its long- term negative social impacts.",
      "The mutual surveillance that has emerged during the pandemic occurs through the alienation of individuals seen to flout safe distancing rules, potentially encouraging bullying at the expense of empathy; its risks fuelling social divisions.",

      "Likening recovery from a crisis to recovery from a disease, American academic Daniel Aldrich states that it has more to do with the quality of the host than the nature of the disease.",
      "The relationship between social capital and recovery partially explains why places like New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina did not witness a vibrant recovery seen in Kobe after the Great Hanshin earthquake in 1995.",
      "The Need to Factor Trust Despite the utility of crowdsourced surveillance to clamp down on the violation of safe distancing laws, it is also crucial to recognise how a social panopticon may negatively affect trust and social capital.",
      "As Foucault argued, the effects of surveillance are permanent, and declining social capital is a cause for concern as it cannot be rebuilt overnight, requiring a longer-term approach.",
      "The recovery from COVID-19 is a lengthy process.",
      "As countries adjust to the new normal and establish new norms to navigate a post-COVID-19 reality, it is important to weigh the short-term gain of constructing a panoptic society with the long-term impacts of its blow on social capital.",

    "close_book_answer": [
      "India's experience with contact tracing and epidemiological containment in the COVID-19 pandemic provides valuable insights and lessons for other countries facing similar challenges. Firstly, India's extensive network of primary care providers and community health workers played a vital role in identifying potential COVID-19 cases at an early stage. This early detection enabled the officials to trace and isolate infected individuals before they could spread the virus to others. In contrast, other countries relied heavily on hospital-based testing, which resulted in delayed detection and spread of the virus.",
      "Secondly, India's use of technology, such as point-of-care testing and digital reporting systems, facilitated efficient contact tracing and monitoring of the virus. These systems allowed health officials to identify high-risk individuals and trace their contacts quickly, thereby preventing further spread of the virus. Although other countries have also utilized technology in their contact tracing efforts, India's approach was particularly effective in a country with a large and diverse population.",
      "Lastly, India's emphasis on community engagement and cooperation was crucial to the successful implementation of contact tracing and epidemiological containment measures. By educating the public on COVID-19 and its transmission, the Indian government was able to create a culture of compliance and cooperation with contact tracing efforts. This allowed for the identification and isolation of infected individuals more easily, leading to the overall reduction of cases in the country.",
      "In conclusion, India's experience with contact tracing and epidemiological containment provides a model for other countries to follow in their efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. By utilizing primary care providers, technology, and community engagement, India was able to halt the spread of the virus and prevent widespread illness and death. Other countries would be wise to learn from India's approach and incorporate similar strategies in their own pandemic response efforts."

      "White supremacist groups have been utilizing disturbing methods to spread disinformation and incite violence. One such method is the use of social media platforms, specifically encrypted messaging apps, to spread hateful ideologies and call for acts of violence (Lendermon, 2020). These messaging apps provide a secure and hidden space for white supremacists to share their beliefs and collaborate with each other, making it difficult for law enforcement agencies to monitor their activities (Albright et al., 2020).",
      "Another disturbing method used by white supremacist groups is the creation of fake news articles and videos that spread disinformation and propagate hateful rhetoric (Stimson, 2019). These fake news articles and videos are often shared on social media platforms and have the potential to go viral, spreading hateful messages to a large audience.",
      "Lastly, white supremacist groups have been known to use violence as a means of spreading fear and instilling a sense of power (Hayes, 2019). These violent acts, such as the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting and the Christchurch mosque shootings, are often live-streamed on social media platforms and are used as propaganda to recruit new members and incite violence among existing members (Sproule, 2019).",
      "In conclusion, white supremacist groups have been utilizing disturbing methods to spread disinformation and incite violence. These methods include the use of encrypted messaging apps, fake news articles and videos, and the use of violence as a means of spreading fear. It is important for law enforcement agencies and social media platforms to work together to monitor and prevent the spread of disinformation and hate speech by these groups."

      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Islamist militant networks are utilizing various strategies to grow their support base and resources. Firstly, these networks are leveraging online platforms to spread their ideology and recruit new followers. Social media has become a crucial tool for Islamist militants to disseminate their propaganda, radicalize potential recruits, and solicit financial support from sympathizers.",
      "Furthermore, Islamist militants are capitalizing on the turmoil caused by the pandemic to target vulnerable communities. In some cases, groups like Al-Qaeda and ISIS have been able to take advantage of disrupted governance structures due to the pandemic to expand their footprint in areas that were previously under state control. By offering essential services such as food, medical aid, and security, these groups can gain the trust of local populations and grow their support base.",
      "Finally, Islamist militants are also exploiting the economic downturn caused by the pandemic to fund their activities. Through illicit activities such as smuggling, drug trafficking, and extortion, these groups are generating revenue to sustain their operations. As the global economy recovers, it is essential to monitor the resurgence of these illicit activities and the potential challenges they pose to regional and international security."

      "The gathering of the Tabligi Jama\u2019at movement at the Sri Petaling mosque complex in Malaysia is significant in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in the ASEAN region given the large scale and frequency of gatherings hosted by the movement. The movement is known for organizing mass gatherings for a spiritual retreat, with participants coming from various countries, particularly from within the ASEAN region. Such gatherings pose a significant public health risk, as they create conditions for the rapid spread of COVID-19, given the potential for close contact among large numbers of people.",
      "The gatherings of the Tabligi Jama\u2019at movement have contributed to the spread of COVID-19 in the ASEAN region by providing an opportunity for the virus to spread among participants who may not have been previously infected. The movement has also been criticized for not adhering to proper hygiene practices such as regular hand washing, avoiding close contact with others, and wearing face masks, which exacerbate the risk of COVID-19 transmission.",
      "Furthermore, the economic impact of these gatherings has also been significant, as countries host to the Tabligi Jama\u2019at gatherings have had to invest in increased surveillance, testing, and contact tracing measures. This has put a strain on limited public health resources and diverted resources from other areas such as education and health care.",
      "Overall, the Tabligi Jama\u2019at movement\u2019s gatherings have contributed to the spread of COVID-19 in the ASEAN region, and countries should work to regulate gatherings and ensure proper public health measures are in place to minimize the risk of further transmission."

      "BY NOW alarm has been raised about the numbers of people who have been infected with the COVID-19 virus after attending a large gathering of the Tablighi Jama\u2019at religious movement at the Sri Petaling mosque complex in Malaysia.",
      "The gathering, held on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur from 27 February to 1 March 2020, reportedly involved up to 10,000 people from several countries who are devotees of the Tablighi Jama\u2019at movement.",
      "The Ministry of Health is tracing the contacts of about 90 Singaporeans who attended the gathering, after two were diagnosed with the coronavirus.",
      "Having got themselves infected due to the lack of social distancing, many of the members of this group have returned to their respective countries in the ASEAN region, including Singapore, and there is worry that the virus may spread even further as a result of such large scale human movement.",
      "What is the Tablighi Jama\u2019at? Some have asked how and why the members decided to travel to the gathering in the first place, and whether such gatherings can be better controlled or even temporarily stopped as the world dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "In the case of the Tabligh this is easier said than done, for movement is an essential feature of the group; and if we are to understand why, we would need to understand what the Tabligh.",
      "The Tablighi Jama\u2019at is a lay missionary pietist movement among Muslims that emerged in India a century ago.",
      "From the outset it has emphasised the need for individual believers to leave their comfort zones, go out into the world to face challenges and hardship, and to renounce all things worldly and materialistic.",
      "For seven years I conducted fieldwork with the movement, during which I travelled along with Tabligh members from all over the world - the United Kingdom, France and Germany to India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and to almost every part of Southeast Asia.",
      "This need to travel \u2013 which some of the members described as being on a state of permanent pilgrimage \u2013 lies at the core of what the Tabligh is as a movement of faith renewal.",
      "When the Tabligh was formed in Northern India in the early part of the 20th century, it regarded the state of Muslims as abysmal.",
      "The founders of the movement argued that the faith of many Muslims had been weakened as a result of their attachment to all things worldly (dunia) and materialistic; they believed that one has to renounce worldly attachments to be truly free to believe sincerely.",
      "I have met many members from all walks of life who have, upon joining the movement, renounced their worldly attachments and stopped doing things like watching TV, using social media, or given up smoking or drugs.",
      "Benign Movement that Moves In many ways the Tabligh was and remains a largely benign movement: It has never sought out confrontation with other faith communities (as it largely confines its activities to other fellow Muslims) and it has never had any political ambitions (for it regards politics as something worldly and therefore a distraction from faith and love for God).",
      "Outsiders have sometimes seen them as fatalistic, apolitical and apathetic to the wider needs of society, but the members would argue that one cannot change the world positively unless one has been a better and more faithful individual first.",
      "What is special about the Tabligh is that it is a movement that does not have the rigidity of parties, organisations or corporations.",
      "Membership is open to all and on a flexible basis: Some join and follow the Tabligh for a weekend a month, some for weeks or months per year, some for life.",
      "One thing that they all do is move, in order to meet other members of the faith community and to weaken their bonds to the material world around them.",
      "They do not stay in hotels when they travel (for that would be unseemly and too worldly), but choose to stay in mosques and seminaries.",
      "This is a mobile movement.",
      "In the Indonesian province of West Papua I met a young Tabligh lad who had travelled all the way to Peru \u2013 via Jakarta then to Singapore, then to Japan, then to Los Angeles on to Mexico and finally to Peru and back again.",
      "At the large gatherings of the Tabligh I have attended in Pakistan, Southern Thailand (at Yala) and Java (at Temboro) I have met thousands of Tablighs from every part of the world.",
      "Way Forward Governments are now faced with the difficult task of educating their respective populations and encouraging them to maintain a healthy social distance from one another while avoiding large gatherings.",
      "This poses a problem for movements that conduct pilgrimages in groups, and this applies not only to the Tabligh but also Christians who undertake pilgrimages along the pilgrimage trails of Europe, Hindus who visit temples, and Buddhists who make pilgrimages to shrines.",
      "So what is the best way forward with such groups? Firstly, we should remember that the Tabligh has in fact had to self-regulate its activities and movements in the recent past.",
      "Two decades ago when Indonesia was in the grip of violent militancy, the Tabligh was infiltrated and used as a vehicle by some radicals who sought to move across Indonesia anonymously.",
      "When it was discovered that terrorists had used the movement as a means to get to places like Bali, the Tabligh responded by checking on its members and ensuring that their movement would not become the vector for violence in the country.",
      "As the Tabligh is a movement of faith and cares about its members\u2019 welfare, it should be made clear to them that social responsibility is also an important value in religion.",
      "Muslim history has many examples of how Muslim rulers have imposed controls on movement in times of epidemics, and Muslim scholars have always laid great emphasis on the concept of collective social wellbeing.",
      "So rather than scape-goating or victim-blaming the Tablighi movement and its members, a better approach would be to engage them constructively while opening opportunities for them to demonstrate social responsibility.",
      "What applies to the Tabligh also applies to all itinerant movements and pilgrimage groups that likewise move from one place to another.",
      "By not singling out the Tabligh as a unique problem we avoid the mistake of adding stigma to crisis; by engaging them positively, such movements can actually play an important role in containing this virus pandemic.",
      "The underlying message ought to be that social welfare and caring for the greater good of society are also components of faith, and they are not incompatible."

      "Certainly! Here's an input-output pair based on the second question:",
      "Input: Governments shape the way technological innovation intersects with social structures through investments, policy incentives, and regulation.",
      "Output: Governments play a crucial role in shaping the direction of technological innovation and its impact on society by investing in research and development, providing policy incentives for specific technologies, and implementing regulations to mitigate potential negative consequences. For example, a government might invest in research related to renewable energy, provide tax breaks for companies that adopt green technologies, or regulate carbon emissions to address climate change. While these efforts can drive innovation, they also can result in unintended consequences, such as concentrating wealth and power in the hands of a few individuals or exacerbating social inequalities. Therefore, governments need to balance innovation with social and ethical considerations to ensure a more equitable distribution of benefits and mitigate any negative impacts on society."

    "close_book_answer": [
      "Technology convergence refers to the merging of different technologies to create new and innovative products or systems. The example of neuroscience converging with high-tech inventions illustrates this concept. In the past, neuroscience and technology were considered separate fields, with each focusing on its specific domain of expertise. However, recent advancements in both fields have led to their convergence. For instance, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are now being developed that can read and translate brain signals into actions. These BCIs use a combination of neuroscience and technology, such as electrodes and machine learning algorithms, to achieve their functionality.",
      "Similarly, wearable technology, such as fitness trackers and smartwatches, also converge with neuroscience. These devices use sensors and algorithms to collect and analyze data on biological signals, such as heart rate and sleep patterns. This data can then be used to provide insights into an individual's physical and mental health. This convergence of technology and neuroscience is further exemplified by the development of virtual reality (VR) and gaming systems. These systems use neurofeedback technology that allows players to control their game using their brainwaves.",

How can responsible innovation be carried out in accordance with the three governmental responsibilities of setting long-term research priorities, creating the favourable conditions for invention and deployment, and managing ethical and social aspects including potential abuses of technology?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The three governmental responsibilities of setting long-term research priorities, creating favourable conditions for invention and deployment, and managing ethical and social aspects including potential abuses of technology are crucial for responsible innovation.",
      "Firstly, setting long-term research priorities entails identifying and funding research areas that address societal challenges and contribute to the welfare of the public. Governments can achieve this by working with experts in the field to identify key research gaps and opportunities, as well as by allocating research funding based on the potential impact of proposed projects.",
      "Secondly, governments can create favorable conditions for invention and deployment by providing financial incentives for research, developing infrastructure and resources for startups and small businesses, and supporting technology transfer and commercialization activities. They can also create regulatory frameworks that promote the development and adoption of new technologies while ensuring that adequate safety and performance standards are maintained.",
      "Finally, managing ethical and social aspects of innovation is critical for mitigating the potential harms of technology. Governments can achieve this by establishing ethical review boards to evaluate the social and ethical implications of proposed research projects and technologies, as well as by creating public engagement activities that facilitate discussions and debates around emerging technologies. Additionally, governments can develop laws and regulations that establish ethical and social norms for technology use, as well as promote transparency and accountability in the development and deployment of emerging technologies.",
      "In conclusion, responsible innovation requires the active involvement and collaboration of governments, researchers, and other stakeholders in addressing the long-term research priorities, creating favorable conditions for invention and deployment, and managing ethical and social aspects of technology development and deployment."

      "In recent years, decentralizing multilateralism has become a growing trend in the governance of international trade. This trend has resulted in the proliferation of plurilateral agreements, which involve a group of like-minded countries negotiating and implementing trade agreements outside of the World Trade Organization (WTO).",
      "One of the key effects of decentralizing multilateralism is the fragmentation of the global trade system. As countries pursue bilateral and plurilateral agreements, it can lead to a breakdown in the cooperation and coordination that the WTO provides. Additionally, the rise of mega-regional agreements, such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), has resulted in increased trade diversion and fragmentation.",
      "Another effect of decentralizing multilateralism is the shift in power dynamics within the global trade system. As countries negotiate and implement agreements outside of the WTO, the organization's authority and ability to enforce its rules are weakened. This can result in a race to the bottom, where countries are incentivized to lower their trade barriers solely to remain competitive in the global market, without regard for the impacts on other countries.",
      "Overall, the trend towards decentralizing multilateralism in the governance of international trade has had significant implications for the global trade system. The proliferation of plurilateral agreements, the breakdown of cooperation and coordination, and the shift in power dynamics are all challenges that must be addressed as the global trade landscape continues to evolve."

    "question": "3. What are the benefits and costs of regional and inter-regional FTAs in the context of decentralizing multilateralism?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "One of the potential benefits of regional and inter-regional free trade agreements (FTAs) in the context of decentralizing multilateralism is increased efficiency and flexibility in trade negotiations. When negotiating a regional or inter-regional FTA, the parties involved are able to focus on issues that are most relevant to their specific region or inter-regional relationship, rather than negotiating with a large and diverse group of countries in a multilateral context. This can lead to faster and more effective trade agreements, as well as the ability to address issues that may not be feasible in a multilateral context.",
      "Another potential benefit of regional and inter-regional FTAs in the context of decentralizing multilateralism is the ability for countries to pursue trade agreements and deepen economic integration with their regional partners, even if multilateral negotiations are stalled or not progressing. This can help to foster regional cooperation and integration, while also providing countries with the opportunity to advance their economic goals.",
      "However, there are also costs associated with regional and inter-regional FTAs in the context of decentralizing multilateralism. These include the potential for increased fragmentation of the global trading system, with multiple overlapping FTAs leading to increased complexity and potential conflict. Additionally, regional FTAs may not always include all key trading partners, leading to potential exclusion and a less inclusive trade environment. Overall, while regional and inter-regional FTAs may offer some benefits in the context of decentralizing multilateralism, careful consideration must be given to the potential costs and impacts on the broader global trading system."

Unlike the \u201ccontested multilateralism\u201d theorists who focus only on the costs, one has to consider both the benefits as well as the costs of the process.",
      "Decentralising Multilateralism: Benefits and Costs On the side of benefits, first, regional and inter-regional FTAs provide an alternative approach to liberalising trade and are useful when WTO negotiations stall, as is the case at the present time.",

      "Going Forward: Strengthening \"WTO Centrality\"? The third cost is the fear that regional and inter-regional FTAs, especially the mega- FTAs which are sizable and cover large segments of world trade and GDP, could undermine \u201cWTO Centrality\u201d mainly in litigating trade disputes.",
      "But again several other authors have found that, in actuality, the dispute settlement procedures contained in regional and inter-regional FTAs have not introduced direct competition with the WTO.",
      "A significant number of disputes tabled at the WTO have involved members of existing their bilateral regional and disagreements.",

      "inter-regional FTAs using to resolve the WTO The move from centralised to decentralising trade multilateralism, therefore, may have improved global trade governance.",
      "The move could have also enhanced the resilience of Asian countries to global shocks like COVID-19 by enabling diversification of trade and supply chains.",
      "Looking ahead, a number of policy measures should be taken to manage the decentralisation process by reforming the WTO.",

    "question": "5. How can the WTO strengthen its centrality in the face of regional and inter-regional FTAs?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "Critical Response:",
      "The World Trade Organization (WTO) is the international body responsible for regulating and promoting global trade among its member nations. However, in recent years, the proliferation of regional and inter-regional free trade agreements (FTAs) has led to concerns about the WTO's centrality in global trade. In order to strengthen its centrality, the WTO needs to adopt several key strategies.",
      "First, the WTO can improve facilitation of trade by streamlining its dispute settlement process. This means reducing the time taken to resolve disputes and creating a more transparent and effective system. By doing so, the WTO can help ensure that disputes are resolved quickly and fairly, reducing the incentive for member countries to resort to unilateral measures or regional trade agreements.",
      "Second, the WTO can further liberalize trade in areas where progress is slow or non-existent. This requires addressing sensitive issues such as agriculture subsidies and tariffs on specific products. The WTO can work towards achieving greater",
      "Third, the WTO needs to enhance its engagement with emerging economies, such as China, India, and Brazil. These countries are becoming increasingly influential in the global economy, and their participation in the WTO is essential for promoting free trade and sustainable economic growth. By engaging with emerging economies, the WTO can help create a more inclusive and equitable trading system.",
      "In conclusion, the WTO can strengthen its centrality by streamlining its dispute settlement process, further liberalizing trade, and enhancing engagement with emerging economies. By adopting these strategies, the WTO can promote free and fair trade among its member nations and ensure that all countries benefit from global economic growth."

    "question": "2. How does India view the Indian Ocean region, and how does this view conflict with China's?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "India views the Indian Ocean region as a strategic priority due to its location, rich resources, and economic importance. As a rising global power, India sees the region as a key area for its economic development, trade, and security. India's economic ties with the countries surrounding the Indian Ocean are critical to its growth, and the country has invested in developing its maritime infrastructure to support its interests in the region.",
      "However, India's view of the Indian Ocean region conflicts with China's rising influence in the region. China's increased presence in the Indian Ocean region has raised security concerns for India, as China's expanding economic, military, and diplomatic ties in the region could potentially undermine India's interests. China's increasing investment in infrastructure and military assets in the Indian Ocean region has also led to concerns over Beijing's long-term strategic ambitions.",
      "India's sensitivity about China's influence in the region is rooted in its historical and cultural ties to the Indian Ocean. The region has traditionally been an Indian cultural and civilizational sphere of influence, and India sees itself as a natural leader in the region. Therefore, India's view of the Indian Ocean region is closely tied to its national identity and strategic interests, making it a potentially contentious issue with China's growing presence in the region."

    "close_book_answer": [
      "Extreme nationalism on both sides of the Sino-Indian rivalry is a major contributor to the perils that currently exist between the two nations. This can be seen in a number of ways, including the rise of ultra-nationalist rhetoric and the increased military build-up within each country. A key claim to support this argument is that extreme nationalism leads to an us-versus-them mentality, where each side views the other as an existential threat, rather than as a potential partner. This creates a situation where dialogue and cooperation become increasingly difficult and conflicts are more likely to arise.",
      "Another claim that supports this argument is that extreme nationalism can fuel hostility and mistrust between the two sides, making it more difficult for either country to back down or compromise in any dispute. This can be seen in the recent past, when tensions between the two countries escalated over issues such as territorial disputes and border incidents. Additionally, ultra-nationalist ideologies can lead to the justifying of aggressive military and territorial expansion, which can further increase the risk of conflict and provoke a dangerous arms race between the two nations."

      "For their part, the ASEAN countries could possibly reconsider the rules they have drawn up regarding cooperation with non-Plus countries in order to reaffirm the principle of ASEAN centrality.",
      "As consensus in this regard may take time, a parallel path could possibly be explored by creating space for dialogue between ASEAN strategic research institutions - which exchange on a regular basis through the Network of ASEAN Defence and Security Institutions, NADI - and equivalent institutions from the EU and European ADMM-Plus applicant countries.",

    "question": "2. How do climate change, pandemics, and other global risks and threats impact international security?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "Climate change, pandemics, and other global risks and threats have significant impacts on international security. Climate change is an increasingly significant driver of conflict and instability, with rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and droughts contributing to displacement, resource scarcity, and social unrest. The World Bank estimates that the frequency of weather-related disasters has increased by 46% since the 1990s, leading to millions of people being displaced and exacerbating existing conflicts. Pandemics can also contribute to international security risks, as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, which created significant challenges for global health systems and disrupted supply chains and economies. The spread of COVID-19 highlighted the interconnectedness of the global community and the potential consequences of inaction or delays in response.",
      "Additionally, global risks and threats also impact international security through the implications for economic stability and growth. Economic disruption, especially in the case of climate change, can contribute to political instability, as seen in the Arab Spring. The 2008 financial crisis, which was caused by a combination of factors, including the housing market bubble and regulatory failures, led to significant economic instability and contributed to social unrest and populist movements around the world.",
      "In conclusion, climate change, pandemics, and other global risks and threats have significant impacts on international security, affecting both human and economic security. Addressing these challenges requires coordinated global action, including the development and implementation of effective policies, cooperation between governments and international organizations, and investment in prevention and preparedness measures."
