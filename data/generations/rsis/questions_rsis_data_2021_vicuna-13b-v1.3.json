    "context": "FOR MANY countries, COVID-19 has been a strategic surprise \u2013 an unanticipated event rendering existing planning assumptions ineffective. The consequences of this have been severe, as many countries have struggled to contain infections and save lives. Despite what the speed and scale of COVID-19\u2019s impact suggest, pandemics are foreseeable, and countries have early warning systems to detect and respond to infectious disease outbreaks. Did these systems fail in the case of COVID-19? If they did not, what might explain the prevalence of strategic surprise? Failure to Detect or Failure to Respond? Following the 2003 SARS epidemic, China invested in a sophisticated early warning system for infectious diseases. While some media reports claim this system failed in the case of COVID-19, the realities of identifying a novel infectious disease are complex. China\u2019s early warning system may have been hampered by its reliance on case information obtained after diagnosis rather than analysis of pre-diagnosis risk factors. Furthermore, despite mandated reporting for pneumonia with unknown causes, it is unclear why cases were not surfaced through the early warning system during the COVID-19 outbreak\u2019s initial phase. In the United States, however, controversy arose over intelligence agencies\u2019 early warnings on COVID-19 apparently being ignored by President Trump. Media reports have also highlighted how the Trump administration cut funding for a pandemic early warning system in September 2019, just months before the COVID-19 outbreak. The Trump administration has not been alone, however, in reallocating resources away from pandemic preparedness \u2013 this despite consistent warnings for more than a decade about the significant risk posed. Questions of how much governments knew during the COVID-19 outbreak\u2019s early days are politically sensitive given the scale of the pandemic\u2019s impact. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has also been criticised for being slow to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. While these issues are underpinned by the efficacy of early warning systems, little attention has been given to why these systems did not create sufficient strategic awareness. Stumbling Blocks The elephant in the room is that an early warning system\u2019s effectiveness is closely linked to how those operating it and responding to its output perceive risk. This is problematic as an individual\u2019s perception of risk is inherently subjective. Everyone \u2013 including experts \u2013 is affected by cognitive biases that can create a gap between evidence of risk and how it is perceived. Risk perception gaps are important because they directly affect reaction time after a warning is communicated. Consider how Taiwan and Vietnam initially raised eyebrows when they implemented extensive control measures much earlier than other countries, but have since been praised for successfully containing COVID-19. Easily-disseminated mis- and disinformation have also made it particularly challenging to address risk perception gaps related to COVID-19. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus highlighted the problem\u2019s severity when he remarked that \u201cwe\u2019re not just fighting an epidemic; we\u2019re fighting an infodemic.\u201d This \u201cinfodemic\u201d also comes at a time when some global leaders have shown open distrust in and disregard for expert opinion. For example, Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro sparked outrage over a seemingly flippant response to his country\u2019s escalating spread of COVID-19. Warning fatigue is another issue that early warning systems must also contend with. Consistently issued warnings for an event that does not happen, or happens with a smaller than expected impact can shape future risk assessments \u2013 a case of \u201ccrying wolf\u201d. It is possible that the (mis)handling of previous pandemics affected risk perceptions of COVID-19. For example, the WHO was previously criticised for apparently overestimating the 2009 H1N1 pandemic\u2019s impact, and this may have in turn shaped its reaction to the COVID-19 outbreak. Prospects for Early Warning Systems Countries will likely apply lessons from epidemiological surveillance systems created during this pandemic to improve existing early warning systems or develop new ones. In particular, we can expect to see tighter integration with smart city infrastructure. South Korea\u2019s Epidemiological Investigation Support System, for example, is enabled by a common data platform originally developed in 2018 for the country\u2019s National Strategic Smart City R&D Programme. This was complemented by apps monitoring inbound travellers and those under quarantine, as well as detailed disclosure of information related to infected individuals\u2019 movements. However, technology-enabled surveillance comes with its own challenges. Concern is growing over potential surveillance creep, exemplified by China\u2019s use of digital health codes to control citizens\u2019 movements. Furthermore, the European Union\u2019s struggle to implement a region-wide contact tracing protocol has highlighted difficulties in finding a balance between respecting privacy and ensuring public safety. Need for Non-Invasive Methods To address this, countries may need to devote more attention to explore non-invasive data collection methods. Wastewater analysis has shown promise, and we may even see nationwide networks of sensors at public places to detect individuals with a fever, as well as those not wearing masks. It will nevertheless take more than leaning on technology to build strategic awareness for the long term. Countries will need to invest in minimising decision-makers\u2019 risk perception gaps, and regional cooperation platforms are well-placed to enable this. The ASEAN Plus Three Summit on COVID-19 took an important step in this direction by resolving to strengthen the region\u2019s early warning system. Regular interactions among officials through ASEAN meeting platforms and the shared experience of coping with this ongoing pandemic will also create more opportunities to narrow risk perception gaps.",

Concern is growing over potential surveillance creep, exemplified by China\u2019s use of digital health codes to control citizens\u2019 movements. Furthermore, the European Union\u2019s struggle to implement a region-wide contact tracing protocol has highlighted difficulties in finding a balance between respecting privacy and ensuring public safety. Need for Non-Invasive Methods To address this, countries may need to devote more attention to explore non-invasive data collection methods. Wastewater analysis has shown promise, and we may even see nationwide networks of sensors at public places to detect individuals with a fever, as well as those not wearing masks. It will nevertheless take more than leaning on technology to build strategic awareness for the long term. Countries will need to invest in minimising decision-makers\u2019 risk perception gaps, and regional cooperation platforms are well-placed to enable this. The ASEAN Plus Three Summit on COVID-19 took an important step in this direction by resolving to strengthen the region\u2019s early warning system. Regular interactions among officials through ASEAN meeting platforms and the shared experience of coping with this ongoing pandemic will also create more opportunities to narrow risk perception gaps.",
    "question": "5. What are the potential consequences of ignoring early warning systems, and how can we ensure that decision-makers take them seriously?",
    "point_form_context": "1. COVID-19 has been a strategic surprise for many countries, rendering existing planning assumptions ineffective.\n2. Pandemics are foreseeable, and countries have early warning systems to detect and respond to infectious disease outbreaks.\n3. China has a sophisticated early warning system for infectious diseases, but it may have been hampered by its reliance on case information obtained after diagnosis rather than analysis of pre-diagnosis risk factors.\n4. The Trump administration cut funding for a pandemic early warning system in September 2019, just months before the COVID-19 outbreak.\n5. The effectiveness of early warning systems is closely linked to how those operating it and responding to its output perceive risk, which is problematic as an individual\u2019s perception of risk is inherently subjective."

    "context": "RUSSIA HAS enormous stakes in stable Sino-Indian relations and cannot be indifferent to the increased tensions between the two Asian powers. Moscow plays a key role in the Russia-India-China (RIC) triangle, Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), and the BRICS, which are important Russian foreign policy platforms. The RIC foreign ministers have been meeting trilaterally since 2003; the RIC\u2019s importance to Russian foreign policy is clear: China and India are seen as crucial to achieving Russia\u2019s objectives of building a multipolar world, with less US/Western influence in the Asia-Pacific in particular and the world in general. China, India in Russia\u2019s Balancing Strategy Established in 2001, with China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, as founder members, the SCO\u2019s broad objectives are to stabilise relations among the Central Asian states with their two powerful neighbours and to promote the development of its members. India and Pakistan joined in 2017. The SCO has proven useful for Central Asia to work principally with China and Russia on a multilateral basis, to balance both powers which are crucial to their well-being and development. For Russia, India balances the growing weight of China in the SCO and in Central Asia itself, a key region to Moscow. The sustainability and even political future of the SCO therefore depend much on the dynamics of the relationship between China and India, given their politico-economic and military weight and membership in the SCO. Should their bilateral tensions worsen, they would have some negative impact on the SCO\u2019s functioning and effectiveness as a forum and platform for Russia\u2019s own interests. The BRICS forum is key to Russia\u2019s foreign policy objectives of lessening US/Western global influence in geopolitical and geo-economic terms as well as to Russia\u2019s economic objectives of promoting more economic interaction among the BRICs member states. To Russia, India and China are important partners in Eurasia and hence, are seen are the key players in BRICS. Brazil and South Africa are too geographically and politically distant to play any meaningful role in Eurasia. Tension between the two Asian powers might weaken BRICS member states\u2019 commitments to their economic and socio-political objectives and declarations; the worst-case scenario would be a looser BRICS. Russia holds the Chairmanship in 2020 of the SCO and BRICS and hence must be concerned about the ramifications of Sino-Indian tensions on the work of the SCO and BRICS in the immediate and near-term. Russia\u2019s own bilateral links with China and India are also crucial to its global position and its own economic development. Russo-Indian and Russo-Chinese Relations India is a major purchaser of Russian weapons and growing investor in the Russian energy sector. Enjoying close links with India also ensures that Russia can counterbalance the growing strategic and politico-economic weight of China in the Asia-Pacific as well as in Central Asia. At the same time, Russia does not want to see India\u2019s relations with the United States become stronger than they already are. For instance, Russia would not want India to become an active member of the Quad; Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reportedly criticised this US-led Indo-Pacific initiative, calling it a \"divisive approach\" to disrupt existing regional structures and contain China. An indication of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s close relationship with Indian PM Narendra Modi was seen in the former\u2019s warm greetings to Modi on his 70th birthday on 17 September 2020. No doubt, this gesture was not only well-meant personally but also acted as an indication of Russia\u2019s close links with India. Russia\u2019s strong relationship with China is a function of their common threat perception of the US, their current economic complementarity (Russian energy for Chinese goods) and strategic convergence in the Asia-Pacific to ensure that the region is not dominated by the US and its allies like Japan. China is also a major importer of Russian energy, a major investor in its energy sector, and Russia\u2019s largest trading partner. Both have been conducting military exercises bilaterally or with other countries in the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO). This is a military alliance comprising six post-Soviet republics, namely Russia, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Of late, observers have prematurely speculated about a de facto alliance between Russia and China. However, the border clashes with India appear to have led to Russian concern about China. According to a South China Morning Post article in August 2020, the Chinese websites NetEase and Sohu reported in July that deliveries of the Russian S-400 missile system had been \u201cdelayed\u201d due to the coronavirus, but Moscow said later the deliveries had been \u201csuspended\u201d. One can only speculate as to Russia\u2019s motives in this regard. Russia as Unofficial Honest Broker For the above reasons, tense Sino-Indian relations are not in Russia\u2019s interest. The fact that India and China have sought to iron out their differences on the sidelines of the mid-September SCO Foreign Ministers\u2019 meeting in Moscow illustrates Russia\u2019s crucial role in trying to reduce tensions, as an unofficial honest broker. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his Indian counterpart, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, agreed to improve mutual trust to ensure peace along their disputed border, and to avoid any action that could escalate the situation; however, no mention was made of any troop withdrawal date. Their Russian counterpart Lavrov was quoted as saying that Russia was \u201cvery happy\u201d to have provided \u201ca platform\u201d for the two Asian powers to discuss the border tensions and stabilise the situation. Nevertheless, India\u2019s defence minister reportedly said on 15 September that the border issue remains \"unresolved\u201d. Noteworthy is that the Sino-Indian relationship is now undergoing difficulties on the economic front as well. The fact that Sino-Indian tensions still remain and have spilled over into the economic realm manifests the obvious limits of Russian influence on either of its crucial partners. Russia can therefore only wait-and-see how far the situation will unfold. Moscow\u2019s difficult balancing posture in the last several years between the two Asian powers might turn out to be not as practical as it could have been assumed all this time.",

The authorities raised the health alert level from Yellow to Orange, the second highest Disease Outbreak Response System Condition level, signalling the spread of the disease was intensifying. This triggered public panic and resulted in distasteful social behaviour. Scores of Singaporeans hoarded rice, instant noodles, and toilet paper, fearing that the country would go into lockdown. Online grocery store Redmart announced it had limited delivery slots due to a sudden 300% surge in demand. NTUC FairPrice, Singapore\u2019s largest supermarket chain\u2019s website temporarily went offline. There was also hoarding and profiteering from the sale of masks and hand sanitisers on online marketplaces. With surgical masks sold out at most pharmacies, scammers online also allegedly sold masks and reneged on orders. Containing Xenophobia & Public Panic Xenophobic remarks about Chinese nationals were already making rounds on the Internet as the virus spread. After the raised health alert, there were also reports of landlords stigmatising and even evicting mainland Chinese tenants who were on quarantine or leave of absence. Some members of the public also shunned healthcare workers from taking public transport, fearing they might contaminate it. Social media platforms were also bombarded with information and misinformation from myriad sources. To allay public anxiety, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong released a recorded message on television and online, assuring Singaporeans that there was no need to panic as the country was not being locked-down, and there were ample supplies of essentials for everyone. He described the outbreak as a test of Singapore\u2019s social cohesion and psychological resilience. He said while \u201cfear and anxiety are natural human reactions\u201d, panic would undermine Singapore\u2019s reputation in the international community and can do more harm than the virus itself.

Defending Public Health According to a study by the Harvard School of Public Health, Singapore has a \u201cgold standard\u201d detection capability. However, the study also notes that Singapore\u2019s detection is \u201cprobably not 100 percent efficient\u201d, and the number of asymptomatic or low-severity cases overlooked is unknown. Singapore also shut its borders to China and has enforced a strict 14-day leave of absence for Chinese nationals returning from the mainland who are permanent residents or have work permits.

In addition, the Ministry of Manpower has also revoked work passes, repatriated, and barred violators from working in Singapore permanently.

In order to keep the public updated on the latest outbreak information and combat rumours and fake news, the government has set up an official page and communication software that provides daily updates to subscribers. The government has also emphasised the ethos of Singapore\u2019s Total Defence policy to highlight how every Singaporean needs to play a part to overcome this national challenge. Total Defence was launched in 1984 as a national defence initiative to rally all citizens behind the Singapore Armed Forces during war.

Singaporeans\u2019 Quiet Civic Spirit The initial panic among some appears to have been contained. Undeniably, despite the negative behaviour, most Singaporeans swiftly adjusted to the outbreak and showed considerable calm and rationality. Singaporeans have not only called out the disgraceful behaviour by some, there are also accounts of them giving out masks and hand sanitizers to fellow citizens, bringing food to people on leave of absence, offering to ferry healthcare workers to and from the hospitals, among other things. There have also been numerous initiatives in the community by charities and social service agencies \u2013 who have mobilised to distribute meals, hand sanitisers and masks to the vulnerable in their community, share important public health messages, rally the community to take ownership and commit to upholding good hygiene practices, and raise funds to support the various efforts towards battling COVID-19. Singapore-based Facebook crowdsourcing platform, StandUpFor.SG invited people to write notes of encouragement for healthcare workers, which the group disseminates to healthcare institutions. Insofar, more than a thousand contributions have come in from the general public, schools and non-profit organisations, including a Valentine's Day card by the Prime Minister.

He said while \u201cfear and anxiety are natural human reactions\u201d, panic would undermine Singapore\u2019s reputation in the international community and can do more harm than the virus itself. Singapore has no choice but to be extra vigilant and transparent in its fight against COVID-19. The government has implemented a series of measures to reduce the risk of imported cases and community transmission of the deadly disease. Singapore is looking to develop local manufacturing capabilities of masks as export regulations It has established a highly sophisticated contact-tracing tighten elsewhere. mechanism to track every known possible contact of those infected so they can be quarantined or monitored. Defending Public Health According to a study by the Harvard School of Public Health, Singapore has a \u201cgold standard\u201d detection capability. However, the study also notes that Singapore\u2019s detection is \u201cprobably not 100 percent efficient\u201d, and the number of asymptomatic or low-severity cases overlooked is unknown. Singapore also shut its borders to China and has enforced a strict 14-day leave of absence for Chinese nationals returning from the mainland who are permanent residents or have work permits. The country has a zero-tolerance approach to any breaches of the measures it has put in place. People who breach Quarantine Orders stand to be fined. In addition, the Ministry of Manpower has also revoked work passes, repatriated, and barred violators from working in Singapore permanently. Indeed this week, on 28 February, a China couple will be charged for giving false information and obstructing contact tracing, according to the Ministry of Health. In order to keep the public updated on the latest outbreak information and combat rumours and fake news, the government has set up an official page and communication software that provides daily updates to subscribers. The government has also emphasised the ethos of Singapore\u2019s Total Defence policy to highlight how every Singaporean needs to play a part to overcome this national challenge. Total Defence was launched in 1984 as a national defence initiative to rally all citizens behind the Singapore Armed Forces during war. The framework has since evolved to bolster resilience of Singaporeans and address new threats, including non-military adversities such as economic recessions, pandemics, cyber security breaches, and natural disasters. Accordingly, social resilience refers to a society\u2019s ability to collectively tolerate, absorb, cope with, and adjust to threats of various kinds resulting from social, political, and environmental challenges. Singaporeans\u2019 Quiet Civic Spirit The initial panic among some appears to have been contained. Undeniably, despite the negative behaviour, most Singaporeans swiftly adjusted to the outbreak and showed considerable calm and rationality. Singaporeans have not only called out the disgraceful behaviour by some, there are also accounts of them giving out masks and hand sanitizers to fellow citizens, bringing food to people on leave of absence, offering to ferry healthcare workers to and from the hospitals, among other things. There have also been numerous initiatives in the community by charities and social service agencies \u2013 who have mobilised to distribute meals, hand sanitisers and masks to the vulnerable in their community, share important public health messages, rally the community to take ownership and commit to upholding good hygiene practices, and raise funds to support the various efforts towards battling COVID-19. Singapore-based Facebook crowdsourcing platform, StandUpFor.SG invited people to write notes of encouragement for healthcare workers, which the group disseminates to healthcare institutions. Insofar, more than a thousand contributions have come in from the general public, schools and non-profit organisations, including a Valentine's Day card by the Prime Minister. Businesses have also collaborated with the group to make the initiative a success. Additionally, many unions and organisations gave out care-packages to workers on the frontline of Singapore's efforts against the ongoing threat. AIA Singapore announced offered free additional coverage for all its existing customers, employees and tied representatives. Businesses have also stepped up precautionary and business continuity measures to mitigate the risk of a spread. Going Forward The Government has set up a centralised platform to coordinate and convene the various ground-up efforts \u2013 and urged Singapore to continue acting as a community and turn fears and anxieties into concrete action to contribute in the fight against the epidemic. To conclude, Singapore has displayed rather sturdy social resilience during this crisis. While the deplorable behaviour of some Singaporeans cannot be denied or condoned, some argue that Singaporeans might have coped better if information was disseminated in a more timely manner by the authorities at the initial stage. Specifically, if the orange alert news was communicated with clearer and timelier explanation, Singaporeans might have been better prepared psychologically and acted appropriately. People were unsure about the meaning of the various colour- coded alerts and how they translate into practice \u2013 especially as they watched and compared how the COVID-19 situation was unfolding in other countries. This could explain the relative calm that followed the response and assurances from the government later. As Professor Tommy Koh reiterated, Singapore has historically proven to be able to withstand major crises. If it continues to remain cohesive and resilient, it can overcome the COVID-19 pandemic, too.",

    "context": "VIETNAM IS chairing ASEAN this year, something it has done with notable success twice before - 1998 and 2010. In 2010, Vietnam inaugurated the ADMM-Plus (ASEAN Defence Ministers Meeting Plus) and extended East Asia Summit (EAS) membership to the United States. Given Vietnam\u2019s diplomatic experience and multilateral pro- activism, there is a large degree of optimism regarding Vietnam\u2019s ASEAN Chairmanship in its 25th membership year under the theme \u201cCohesive and Responsive\u201d. Vietnam faces a dense diplomatic schedule, with the chairmanship coinciding with Vietnam\u2019s non-permanent membership of the UN Security Council. This poses logistical challenges for the country. But this dual diplomatic responsibility also offers a rare opportunity for Hanoi to present a well-coordinated foreign policy and achieve maximum impact. In particular, Hanoi should leverage the ASEAN agenda at the global stage at the UN, something previous ASEAN chairs have done with remarkable success. Cohesive and Responsive Hanoi will continue to build on the work and specific initiatives of previous chairs, such as developing smart cities. But they will also be cognizant of the need for any ASEAN chair to produce key deliverables of interests to the chairing country itself. Both thematic elements apply across all pillars of the ASEAN Community. \u201cCohesiveness\u201d symbolises ASEAN\u2019s unity and solidarity in the face of internal and external challenges, to further economic integration, and to raise public ASEAN awareness. \u201cResponsiveness\u201d is Hanoi\u2019s wish to promote greater ASEAN pro-activism in order to be a defender of regional interests in the face of crises. Five Priorities Vietnam has specified five key priorities: First, in order to be responsive, Hanoi will work towards strengthening ASEAN solidarity and unity in order to effectively and punctually address challenges and trends. Second, Vietnam intends to deepen ASEAN integration economically, by raising intra- ASEAN trade and investment levels, and leveraging the Fourth Industrial Revolution, in order to alleviate inequality. Third, Hanoi will promote a greater sense of a collective ASEAN identity and awareness, by encouraging the development of common ASEAN values, joint events and programmes, and broadening ASEAN education locally in each member country. Fourth, the 2020 chair will continue to strengthen good relations with ASEAN\u2019s external partners and seek to extend this network. Lastly, Vietnam will strongly highlight the need to improve ASEAN\u2019s institutional capacity. It plans to conduct a thorough review of the effectiveness of ASEAN\u2019s organisational structure and its operations. Its goal is to identify weaknesses and hurdles and reform ASEAN\u2019s operational methods and procedures to make the group more responsive and pro-active. Enhancing cross-sectoral and cross-pillar coordination and cooperation is a priority. So it is with procedural reform. While Hanoi believes ASEAN must uphold the consensus principle, it will develop a method to apply the ASEAN-X mechanism case-by-case on the basis of ASEAN-wide consensus. In other words, Vietnam seeks a way to find unanimous support across all ten capitals for applying ASEAN-X to very specific issues and questions across all pillars whenever unanimous ASEAN progress is not possible. Pertaining to organisational questions, Vietnam plans to set an example for alleviating the chair\u2019s hosting duties as well as for enhancing the role of the ASEAN Secretariat (ASEC) by organising more ASEAN meetings at the new ASEC building in Jakarta. Three Key Points to Watch Vietnam may attempt to set new directions for ASEAN-led mechanisms, including the EAS and ADMM and there will be efforts to advance cross-sectoral and cross-pillar approaches to better coordinate and tackle emerging security challenges within these forums. Within the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) pillar, Vietnam will seek to promote specific intra-ASEAN partnerships for sustainable development in order to boost intra- ASEAN trade and investment, and ASEAN sustainability measures. Under the ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community (ASCC), Hanoi will try to raise ASEAN awareness by seeking to enhance social security for the most vulnerable ASEAN citizens, to promote cooperation mechanisms to combat fake news, and raise the idea to place the ASEAN symbol on passports. Three Off-the-Radar Items to Watch In addition to the above agenda items, there will be several off-the-radar issues and flashpoints to watch. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) will receive particular attention and may become a concrete deliverable for Vietnam, after Thailand failed to put the seal on a pact that includes India. Second, although several officials have assured member states that Vietnam will not hijack the ASEAN agenda by placing the South China Sea at the centre of its chairmanship, it will remain a flashpoint given Vietnam\u2019s key role and recent Sino- Vietnamese tensions. The extent to which this will feature on the 2020 agenda will largely depend on either the restraint or assertiveness of China. But it would be desirable to reserve this issue for retreats and informal discussions. Lastly, the behaviour of the United States is worth observing. The Trump administration\u2019s engagement of ASEAN has been disappointingly low, and in 2020, the president is unlikely to attend the EAS, as it will coincide with the presidential elections. However, Washington may be incentivised to meet ASEAN leaders in a special US-ASEAN summit or otherwise, which would mitigate Trump\u2019s assaults on Asian multilateralism. Given Vietnam\u2019s increasingly active role on the global stage and within ASEAN, as well as the challenging regional environment and difficult issues, there will be much to observe in ASEAN in 2020 and Vietnam is uniquely well placed to move ASEAN forward.",

    "context": "IN A recent virtual ceremony, the United States ambassador to Indonesia Sung Kim officiated the construction of a campus for Indonesia\u2019s Maritime Security Board or Bakamla (Badan Keamanan Laut) on Batam Island, just south of Singapore. With a commitment to spend US$3.5 million, it was to be furnished with classrooms, barracks, and launching pad. The project was initiated by former head of Bakamla Vice Admiral Achmad Taufiqoerrochman in 2019. The training centre was originally to be developed in Serang, Banten province in West Java. But the new Bakamla chief, Vice Admiral Aan Kurnia, relocated the campus\u2019 site to Batam. Several problems have been bothering the US government, making it hesitant about going forward with its training assistance. Against this backdrop, the training centre was exposed to criticism as a form of US intervention in Indonesia\u2019s domestic affairs. The Snags: Grey Areas To resolve this potential snag, some grey areas need serious attention by the related parties involved in the preparation of the facility \u2500 both the US government and Bakamla. Firstly, the training curricula: Since the Batam training centre for Bakamla is the first model in Indonesia\u2019s maritime law education, the issue is very important. For example, which curricula will be implemented, the US or local one? There is speculation in the Indonesian media that the US Coast Guard (USCG), as the counterpart of Bakamla, will consequently be in charge of the training and therefore the deployment USCG officers. The problem is that the USCG training materials and philosophical basis are totally different from Bakamla's. Even their tactical understandings are incompatible. USCG is a military branch of the US Armed Forces while Bakamla is purely civilian. So, will the curricula adopt Bakamla\u2019s philosophy? Most unlikely, as the agency has no such experience and foundation. Since its beginning, including when it was still a coordinating entity named Bakorkamla or Badan Koordinasi Keamanan Laut, the employees are a blend of seconded civil servants, police officers and navy men. They had no training except that prepared by their respective institutions. Indonesia\u2019s Judicial System: Bakamla\u2019s Lack of Clout Secondly, the judicial system: In the US the Coast Guard has authority as the main party that handles all cases in the maritime realm of the country. It has its own attorney to do the job. His/her tasks are relatively easy to accomplish since the state\u2019s judicial system has almost everything related to maritime law: penal code, jurisprudence. In the case of Indonesia\u2019s judicial system, it only knows the National Police as the party that has the authority to bring any legal case, including maritime-related ones, to court. Bakamla has no such power. That is why when it recently seized the Iranian and Panamian tankers, MT Horse and MT Freya respectively, the board handed them over to the harbour master office of Batam for trial. Thirdly, Indonesia has many legal provisions scattered over several different laws of which only limited numbers of attorneys and judges really understand them and have been using in their ruling. Fourthly, the instructors. Who are going to teach at the training centre? USCG officers or domestic instructors? Of course, it will be a combination of them. But Indonesia has few experts to do the teaching and therefore will definitely depend on the overseas instructors. Accordingly, as soon as the training centre is completed, there will be many foreigners coming to Batam as instructors.  This inflow will be perceived negatively by the locals and will not be good for the US-backed facility. Despite its potential to improve Indonesia\u2019s maritime law by educating new Bakamla officers, the centre faces problems arising from the current maritime legal architecture. The deficit, to a certain degree, can be perceived as a confirmation of speculation that the grant is a part of the US\u2019 move to contain China\u2019s expansionism in the South China Sea. Bakamla would be seen as having been easily persuaded to support the US in its rivalry with China for regional dominance. Bakamla: Beefing Up the Newcomer Bakamla is a newcomer to Indonesia\u2019s maritime legal landscape. Six years ago, the Board\u2019s profile among local maritime law enforcement institutions was still in the making. The Marine Police and Sea and Coast Guard unit of the Ministry of Transport had negative sentiments towards Bakamla; this is because the Board had publicly stated that the two agencies would be dismantled and absorbed into Bakamla. On the other hand, the transport ministry\u2019s unit, locally known as Kesatuan Penjagaan Laut dan Pantai (KPLP), and the Marine Police are full-fledged institutions whose legal basis and traditions are much more established. Their resentment towards Bakamla is therefore understandable. Bakamla came into force by the enactment of the law on maritime affairs in 2014. This is a generic regulation for an important agency with massive tasks and responsibility. Only one provision \u2500 chapter 58 \u2500 is dedicated to the board. It will carry out coast guard tasks like law enforcement at sea, maritime search and rescue operations. Following this, President Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo issued Presidential Regulation No. 178/2014. Legal experts, however, say that this is not enough basis for Bakamla to be effective. Instead, the government should issue a Government Regulation (PP) to raise the status of Bakamla to be a primus inter pares institution. That is to say, to be the first among equals. In essence, the snags arise from the fact that the officials of Bakamla come from various educational backgrounds \u2500 from social sciences up to engineering. No specialist training is provided for them following their recruitment. For those who are seconded to Bakamla, the training is conducted by their respective internal training units without having anything to do with the board\u2019s mission. Notwithstanding the circumstances, Bakamla\u2019s dedicated maritime law enforcement training centre in Batam is still a welcome development. At the very least, it will help streamline and integrate the institutional values, procedures and management of an important institution. In the long-run, Bakamla will help produce generations of officials who will contribute to the security of Indonesia's sprawling coastline.",

    "context": "AS COVID-19 began to spread within the community, the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) on 24 March 2020 took the unprecedented step to announce the temporary closure of all mosques in the country. Upon the advice of the Fatwa Committee, MUIS also directed the suspension of the obligatory Friday prayers pending recovery from the global pandemic. The objective was to break the cycle of local community transmission of COVID-19 through mosque clusters. Singapore is among the first few countries in the world to close their mosques amid the COVID-19 threat. As the move had never been done before, it required a certain boldness of resolve backed by independent reasoning to formulate the supporting fatwa. Thereafter, other countries whether with Muslim majorities or minorities took a similar stance. Singapore\u2019s fatwa has resonated globally as other Islamic authorities and scholars similarly called for the temporary closure of mosques and suspension of Friday prayers in the face of the pandemic. Progressive Muslim Community The fatwa or religious edict on mosque closure reflects the progressive spirit of a minority Muslim community. It also highlights the need for religious scholars to be proactive, courageous and be open to work hand-in-hand with authorities to make decisions that are timely and accurate, yet without compromising religious principles. In this regard, MUIS exhibited independent religious thinking by acting swiftly based on the situation report from the Ministry of Health about returnees from a Tabligh movement\u2019s mass gathering in Kuala Lumpur, two of whom tested positive for COVID- 19. Recognising the potential of large mosque clusters emerging within the community, the Fatwa Committee convened within days and issued its newly formulated fatwa authorising the mosque closures. This probably helped narrow the window for the virus to circulate among the mosque congregants, thus preventing large clusters from forming. Malaysia, which closed all its mosques about a week later on the18 March 2020 saw a large cluster formed from the same Tabligh event. This flexibility and independence of thought are also exhibited in other MUIS initiatives during this highly-challenging period, extending Muslim verbal greetings while refraining from the traditional handshakes. Extensive research has also been conducted by MUIS on how to incorporate national measures like social distancing into congregational prayers should conditions allow for mosques to be reopened. The Singapore Fatwa Twelve days before the blanket temporary closures of mosques, MUIS directed the disinfection of all mosques in Singapore. This followed confirmation by the authorities that at least 90 Singaporeans had attended the Tabligh gathering at Seri Petaling Mosque in Selangor. Two of them subsequently tested positive for COVID-19. It was the rising number of infections that led MUIS to close the mosques pending recovery from the pandemic. The Mufti of Singapore, Dr Nazirudin Mohd Nasir, emphasised the need for mosques to remain closed and for congregational prayers to remain suspended until there were significant improvements in the situation as advised by the Ministry of Health. To date, the Fatwa Committee maintains the view that the temporary closure of mosques or the suspension of congregational prayers during the pandemic is an emergency, which required exceptional religious rulings to save lives. Using the Islamic legal maxims of \u201cemergencies permit the unlawful\u201d and \u201charm must be eliminated\u201d, the Fatwa Committee ascertained that it was therefore permissible for Muslim men to forego the obligatory Friday prayers as such large gatherings would enhance the risk of community exposure to the virus threat. Mosques were also closed for other congregational prayers and religious activities. Subsequently, similar moves were taken up by Muslims in other countries to close mosques as the virus threat spread rapidly within communities across the globe. Flexibility of Sharia Law The point that is often missed is that Sharia is not a static set of rules devoid of flexibility. The nature of Sharia has been indiscriminately abused by conservative Islamist groups such that Sharia law is associated with rigidity and severity. In actual fact, flexibility is one of the defining characteristics of Sharia. Through the process of ijtihad (the exercise of reasoning to derive new rules from Islamic principles), Muslim jurists throughout Islamic history had codified legal theories and established a plethora of methodologies to suit the context and challenges of different times. These theories accumulated over time to form a treasure trove of guidelines for future jurists to rely on with room for flexibility and adaptability. This very feature has enabled Sharia rulings to remain applicable and adjustable according to context, dealing even with society\u2019s unprecedented situations. Islamic scholars are guided by Sharia law\u2019s principles, while providing Muslims with practical and appropriate guidance. There is no better example than the permitted lifting of restrictions to eat pork during life-threatening emergencies. Should a Muslim ever be in a position to choose between dying or eating pork, the guiding principle of life preservation takes precedence over the prohibition to consume the meat. The adaptability of Sharia is probably its greatest asset and manifestation of a living religion. The fatwa on mosque closure provides a model of how Sharia law is not cast in stone and can adapt to change in a timely, yet religiously-aligned manner. This requires wisdom, courage and flexible mindsets on the part of religious authorities. By adopting these values of the Sharia, an authentic yet progressive Islam can provide solutions to problems that Muslims face today.",

    "context": "THE FIFTH anniversary of the death of Singapore\u2019s founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew passed quietly on 23 March 2020. The uneventful day was hardly surprising in a world brought almost to a standstill by the ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is a time of unprecedented crisis, testing the mettle of leadership in every country and the resilience of its people. If he were alive, Mr Lee would have quite a bit to say about leaders and their people in such trying times. He had experienced many such periods in his 35 years as prime minister. What lessons can Singaporeans draw from the way he faced those challenges that might be relevant today? I can think of three. #1: Singapore\u2019s Vulnerability: Myth or Reality? First, was his clear-eyed, unsentimental view of Singapore\u2019s vulnerability: A small island with a multi-racial people with no natural resources completely dependent on the outside world for trade and investments. For him, this was not just an existential fact but one that shaped the policies he developed to ensure Singapore\u2019s survival and success, including the building up of the armed forces, opening the economy to foreign multi-national companies and inducting the best and brightest into government. Years later he worried that a younger generation, raised amid peace and plenty, took success for granted and was increasingly sceptical about the idea that Singapore was vulnerable.

    "context": "IT IS opportune to consider what we envision as our guiding societal framework, whether in or beyond times of crisis. While the nation is an imagined political community, as Benedict Anderson puts it, nationalism has a historic role in constructing Singapore\u2019s identity through narratives of multiracialism and a shared past. This said, it is timely to look at how ideas of inclusion may be widened to encompass those who appear foreign, transient and unfamiliar. This pandemic has seen a global resurgence of racism and xenophobia, and Singapore is no exception. At the same time, reactions to COVID-19 include ground-up initiatives that signal a will to help those in need, within and beyond national borders. Nationalism and Cosmopolitanism To make sense of this discordance, it is useful to revisit notions of nationalism and cosmopolitanism as distinct yet complementary ways of thinking about inclusion. As we move forward, what forms of solidarity do we want to take with us, and what should we leave behind in order to build a better society? While nationalism as a concept and lived reality has contested definitions, it has at its core the binding of an 'us' through the creation of an \u2018Other\u2019. This demarcation between members and non-members may take the form of difference based on citizenship status, ethno-cultural and/or ideological perspectives. Hence, while nationalism has unifying potentials, this pandemic demonstrates the insidious side of nationalism. First, protectionist policies inhibit the export of medical supplies and other essential needs. This approach disrupts access to resources, free flowing exchanges and mobilities. Borders are fortified, with the export of protective medical equipment and travel restricted. These practices of economic nationalism, while understandably reactionary, undermine the need for cooperation in times of crisis. E.B. White, novelist and essayist, forewarned that nationalism presupposes local self-sufficiency, and entitlement based on belonging. The pandemic has pulled this curtain back. Signs point toward a renewed awareness of how interconnected and interdependent we are, with resources, knowledge and national economies contingent on the survival of the international community. Pandemic and Xenophobia Second, nationalism explains how the pandemic has exacerbated xenophobia and racism. In the context of pandemics, the connection between disease and foreignness is not new. US intellectual Susan Sontag points out that syphilis in the 15th century was termed the \u2018French pox\u2019 by the English, \u2018morbus Germanicus\u2019 by the Parisians, and the \u2018Chinese disease\u2019 by the Japanese. In today\u2019s context, this same logic manifests in exclusionary political rhetoric and racism towards individuals identified as Chinese, specifically because they were seen as a key vector of COVID-19. Such incidents affect those close to home, including Singaporean-Chinese migrants who endured COVID-19-related attacks in Australia and the United Kingdom. Unfortunately, these exclusionary sentiments are also present in Singapore. With the caveat that xenophobia and racism precede COVID-19, the pandemic triggered more Sinophobic sentiments in Singapore, with calls to ban travellers from China. More recently, transient migrant workers were critiqued for being responsible for the spread of COVID-19, particularly those of South Asian descent who are already subject to stigmas of poor hygiene and posing threats to public order. That nationalism is not necessarily divisive should be noted. Political scientist Yael Tamir argues that 'xenophobic nationalism [is] an expression of valuable ideas gone astray\u2019 and isolationist practices are far from the norm. Nationalism can be a salve in times of crisis, and there is perhaps no better time for national unity than the present. It is however necessary to acknowledge and remedy the toxic effects of nationalism on social cohesion. Moral Cosmopolitanism? Cosmopolitanism provides a foil to nationalism through the idea that all humans are members of a single community. Some proponents of economic cosmopolitanism advocate for a single global economy and limited state intervention. However, the mobilisation of grassroots aid efforts toward rectifying inequalities during this pandemic is not one that appears driven by economic logic. Instead, it speaks to moral cosmopolitanism, which calls for an ethical responsibility to extend concern for the individual beyond borders and to all of humanity. This ethos of moral cosmopolitanism resonates with efforts not motivated by an ethics of outcome but an ethics of right action. For moral cosmopolitans, decisions are made based on whether they are deemed right or wrong, regardless of their consequences. To illustrate, countries are providing resources and refuge for those stranded at sea, donations are made across borders to healthcare workers through personal protective equipment, and communities are rallying together to form support networks for the poor, differently-abled and marginalised, regardless of nationality. Unconditional Goodwill to Migrant Workers Aiding others beyond the national \u2018us\u2019 is also evident on a local level. Here, Singaporean citizens and residents are offering their homes to Malaysians affected by the lockdown, while coordinating food and clothing donations. When the government distributed Solidarity Payments to Singaporeans, donations were made to NGOs and charities, including those dedicated to migrant workers. There are also numerous ground-up initiatives seeking to ease the plight of migrant workers by raising funds, distributing essential needs and raising morale. Such moments of unconditional goodwill are promising, suggesting the need and potential for continuity. A duty of care forms the foundation of these movements. Beyond national bonds is a moral commitment to help those in need regardless of nationality, as a matter of justice and human rights. This rationality, and the acts they entail, counter the oft-held presumption that attachments to fellow citizens should be exclusive and privileged. A Key Language While a general ethos of moral cosmopolitanism can have positive effects on a community, it should not be treated as a replacement for nationalism. Where nationalism has its exclusionary properties, it is also necessary for social cohesion. As this crisis shows, moral cosmopolitanism and nationalism are not fundamentally opposed but are effectively two sides of a coin. More than ever, we are reminded of societal complexities as xenophobia is juxtaposed with acts of compassion toward migrants, and as nations both compete and cooperate for resources and knowledge to overcome this pandemic. Nationalism\u2019s collective spirit and cosmopolitanism\u2019s duty to others beyond our own should both be harnessed. Taking a balanced stance is particularly salient in Singapore, where economic and social progress hinges on both national solidarity and an openness to diversity. Developing a good society may well be the remedy for fractiousness and antagonisms whether in exceptional or unexceptional times. Looking forward, this period reinforces the necessity of leaving behind old habits of exclusivity and taking with us compassion toward strangers in our midst.",

Pandemic and Xenophobia Second, nationalism explains how the pandemic has exacerbated xenophobia and racism. In the context of pandemics, the connection between disease and foreignness is not new. US intellectual Susan Sontag points out that syphilis in the 15th century was termed the \u2018French pox\u2019 by the English, \u2018morbus Germanicus\u2019 by the Parisians, and the \u2018Chinese disease\u2019 by the Japanese. In today\u2019s context, this same logic manifests in exclusionary political rhetoric and racism towards individuals identified as Chinese, specifically because they were seen as a key vector of COVID-19. Such incidents affect those close to home, including Singaporean-Chinese migrants who endured COVID-19-related attacks in Australia and the United Kingdom. Unfortunately, these exclusionary sentiments are also present in Singapore. With the caveat that xenophobia and racism precede COVID-19, the pandemic triggered more Sinophobic sentiments in Singapore, with calls to ban travellers from China. More recently, transient migrant workers were critiqued for being responsible for the spread of COVID-19, particularly those of South Asian descent who are already subject to stigmas of poor hygiene and posing threats to public order. That nationalism is not necessarily divisive should be noted. Political scientist Yael Tamir argues that 'xenophobic nationalism [is] an expression of valuable ideas gone astray\u2019 and isolationist practices are far from the norm. Nationalism can be a salve in times of crisis, and there is perhaps no better time for national unity than the present. It is however necessary to acknowledge and remedy the toxic effects of nationalism on social cohesion. Moral Cosmopolitanism? Cosmopolitanism provides a foil to nationalism through the idea that all humans are members of a single community. Some proponents of economic cosmopolitanism advocate for a single global economy and limited state intervention. However, the mobilisation of grassroots aid efforts toward rectifying inequalities during this pandemic is not one that appears driven by economic logic. Instead, it speaks to moral cosmopolitanism, which calls for an ethical responsibility to extend concern for the individual beyond borders and to all of humanity. This ethos of moral cosmopolitanism resonates with efforts not motivated by an ethics of outcome but an ethics of right action. For moral cosmopolitans, decisions are made based on whether they are deemed right or wrong, regardless of their consequences. To illustrate, countries are providing resources and refuge for those stranded at sea, donations are made across borders to healthcare workers through personal protective equipment, and communities are rallying together to form support networks for the poor, differently-abled and marginalised, regardless of nationality. Unconditional Goodwill to Migrant Workers Aiding others beyond the national \u2018us\u2019 is also evident on a local level. Here, Singaporean citizens and residents are offering their homes to Malaysians affected by the lockdown, while coordinating food and clothing donations. When the government distributed Solidarity Payments to Singaporeans, donations were made to NGOs and charities, including those dedicated to migrant workers. There are also numerous ground-up initiatives seeking to ease the plight of migrant workers by raising funds, distributing essential needs and raising morale. Such moments of unconditional goodwill are promising, suggesting the need and potential for continuity. A duty of care forms the foundation of these movements. Beyond national bonds is a moral commitment to help those in need regardless of nationality, as a matter of justice and human rights. This rationality, and the acts they entail, counter the oft-held presumption that attachments to fellow citizens should be exclusive and privileged. A Key Language While a general ethos of moral cosmopolitanism can have positive effects on a community, it should not be treated as a replacement for nationalism. Where nationalism has its exclusionary properties, it is also necessary for social cohesion. As this crisis shows, moral cosmopolitanism and nationalism are not fundamentally opposed but are effectively two sides of a coin. More than ever, we are reminded of societal complexities as xenophobia is juxtaposed with acts of compassion toward migrants, and as nations both compete and cooperate for resources and knowledge to overcome this pandemic. Nationalism\u2019s collective spirit and cosmopolitanism\u2019s duty to others beyond our own should both be harnessed. Taking a balanced stance is particularly salient in Singapore, where economic and social progress hinges on both national solidarity and an openness to diversity. Developing a good society may well be the remedy for fractiousness and antagonisms whether in exceptional or unexceptional times. Looking forward, this period reinforces the necessity of leaving behind old habits of exclusivity and taking with us compassion toward strangers in our midst.",

    "context": "IN THE latest survey results released by pollster Invoke, 51% of Malaysians polled in February 2021 were not sure which party to vote for if the election was called then, while another 17% declined to answer. Of the remaining 32%, half (16%) chose Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin\u2019s Perikatan Nasional (PN) while Barisan Nasional (BN), Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) and Pakatan Harapan (PH) enjoyed pathetic support of 8%, 4% and 3% respectively. The low support for all parties reflects voters\u2019 disillusion and frustration with the rapid political changes that have taken place since 2015, peaked in 2018 with the ouster of BN followed by the collapse of the PH government 22 months later. Malaysia\u2019s Permanent Coalitions: Fading Out? When Muhyiddin assumed power in March 2021, PN then was meant to be a grand coalition of Malay and native parties including his Malaysian United Indigenous Party (Bersatu), United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), PAS and the ex-BN Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS). Now mainly the pact of Bersatu and PAS, PN would be challenged by both PH, the official opposition, and an UMNO-led BN in the next election. UMNO sets its goals to annihilate Bersatu, its splinter formed in 2016 and home to UMNO\u2019s 15 defected parliamentarians. At the heart of realignments is the fading out of permanent coalitions, the only way of multi-ethnic, multiparty power-sharing that Malaysians have known since independence. In countries where no one party can win a simple majority in the parliament, coalitions are commonly formed to ensure political inclusion and stability. But most of these coalitions are formed after election, negotiated based on seat strength and meant to last for only the parliament\u2019s term. Coalition partners are to contest against each other in the next election and which parties would form the next coalition government depends on parties\u2019 new parliamentary strength. Political Inclusion and Stability In permanent coalitions, parties stick to each other before, during and after elections. Not only do they not contest against each other, they try to pool support for each other. Parties in permanent coalitions are akin to formalised factions in parties, except that they maintain separate organisation structure, leadership and party label to appeal to different social constituencies. The idea of permanent coalition was introduced in Malaysia by circumstance. In 1952, UMNO faced a crucial challenge by its multi-ethnic splinter Independence of Malaya Party (IMP) led by its founder president Dato\u2019 Onn Jaafar in Kuala Lumpur\u2019s inaugural municipal election. An ad-hoc and local electoral pact between UMNO and the then Malayan Chinese Association (MCA) was rewarded with a landslide, soon giving birth to the Alliance which was subsequently joined by the then Malayan Indian Congress (MIC). Against the background of a Chinese-dominant communist insurgency, a permanent coalition with parties representing different ethnic groups was seen by both the British and Malayans as the only guarantee of political inclusion and stability. The Alliance model was so dominant that it was copied in Sabah and Sarawak by the local parties on the eve of Malaysia\u2019s formation. To reduce political competition, Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak merged the three regional Alliance and co-opted opposition parties including PAS into the enlarged coalition of BN in 1974. This idea was eventually copied by the opposition in 1990 after UMNO\u2019s schism between Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and his former finance minister Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah. His splinter party, Semangat 46 (S46), brought together PAS and the Chinese-dominant and secular Democratic Action Party (DAP) to form the \u201csecond\u201d multiethnic coalition as BN\u2019s alternative. A Two-Coalition System? Modelling on the British two-party system, a system of two multi-ethnic and centrist permanent coalitions was seen as the only way to dislodge UMNO-BN. Instead of PAS and DAP attacking BN from the ethnic flanks accusing UMNO and MCA as sell-outs of their respective community, an opposition united front induced their moderation with the prospect of winning power. The \u201ctwo-coalition system\u201d, however, had a friend and foe in the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) electoral system. While it encouraged parties to pool votes to win ethnically mixed constituencies, it also overly weakened the loser between the two permanent coalitions that their communal components were tempted to return to their ethnic or regional flanks. This resulted in the collapse of Razaleigh\u2019s united front, followed by Barisan Alternatif (BA), Pakatan Rakyat (PR) and ultimately BN after its ousters in 2018. In the first three episodes, PAS\u2019 push for harsh Hudud punishments in PAS-administered states prompted DAP to break ties. The two-coalition project was rescued by UMNO\u2019s successive schisms, first between Mahathir Mohamad and his deputy Anwar Ibrahim who led BA and PR, then between Prime Minister Najib Razak and Mahathir since 2015. Najib successfully drew PAS out and changed the opposition coalitions\u2019 formula of an UMNO splinter \u2014 S46 and subsequently PKR \u2014 leading PAS and DAP. The 2018 election was fought between BN, PAS and PH which contained two UMNO splinter parties \u2014 PKR and Bersatu \u2014 and DAP and PAS\u2019 splinter Amanah. When BN disintegrated within months after its defeat due to exodus of East Malaysian parties and defection of UMNO parliamentarians, UMNO and PAS formalised their pact to take on the then Mahathir-led, multiethnic PH, which they accused of betraying the Malays. End of the Two-Coalition Project? The fading out of permanent coalitions spells the end of the two-coalition project. While it has successfully dislodged UMNO, it cannot sustain a stable and multi-ethnic permanent coalition in the opposition, not until power is decentralised, incumbency advantages are reduced and a healthy non-communal divide is found between the government and the opposition. With the current power struggle between UMNO, Bersatu and PAS, even a permanent coalition in government is not possible. The next election is likely to deliver a hung parliament and another post-election coalition, with East Malaysians as guaranteed kingmakers. Even if UMNO and DAP were to team up in the event of a PKR defeat, the deal would likely be one-term at a time for both because UMNO cannot defragmentise Malay politics to restore its hegemony and DAP will not want to be an MCA 2.0. The end of permanent coalitions need not be bad news for political inclusion and stability in Malaysia. With proper reforms, post-election coalitions may give Malaysia real stability in competitive politics.",

While it encouraged parties to pool votes to win ethnically mixed constituencies, it also overly weakened the loser between the two permanent coalitions that their communal components were tempted to return to their ethnic or regional flanks. This resulted in the collapse of Razaleigh\u2019s united front, followed by Barisan Alternatif (BA), Pakatan Rakyat (PR) and ultimately BN after its ousters in 2018. In the first three episodes, PAS\u2019 push for harsh Hudud punishments in PAS-administered states prompted DAP to break ties. The two-coalition project was rescued by UMNO\u2019s successive schisms, first between Mahathir Mohamad and his deputy Anwar Ibrahim who led BA and PR, then between Prime Minister Najib Razak and Mahathir since 2015. Najib successfully drew PAS out and changed the opposition coalitions\u2019 formula of an UMNO splinter \u2014 S46 and subsequently PKR \u2014 leading PAS and DAP. The 2018 election was fought between BN, PAS and PH which contained two UMNO splinter parties \u2014 PKR and Bersatu \u2014 and DAP and PAS\u2019 splinter Amanah. When BN disintegrated within months after its defeat due to exodus of East Malaysian parties and defection of UMNO parliamentarians, UMNO and PAS formalised their pact to take on the then Mahathir-led, multiethnic PH, which they accused of betraying the Malays. End of the Two-Coalition Project? The fading out of permanent coalitions spells the end of the two-coalition project. While it has successfully dislodged UMNO, it cannot sustain a stable and multi-ethnic permanent coalition in the opposition, not until power is decentralised, incumbency advantages are reduced and a healthy non-communal divide is found between the government and the opposition. With the current power struggle between UMNO, Bersatu and PAS, even a permanent coalition in government is not possible. The next election is likely to deliver a hung parliament and another post-election coalition, with East Malaysians as guaranteed kingmakers. Even if UMNO and DAP were to team up in the event of a PKR defeat, the deal would likely be one-term at a time for both because UMNO cannot defragmentise Malay politics to restore its hegemony and DAP will not want to be an MCA 2.0.

    "context": "IN THE latest survey results released by pollster Invoke, 51% of Malaysians polled in February 2021 were not sure which party to vote for if the election was called then, while another 17% declined to answer. Of the remaining 32%, half (16%) chose Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin\u2019s Perikatan Nasional (PN) while Barisan Nasional (BN), Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) and Pakatan Harapan (PH) enjoyed pathetic support of 8%, 4% and 3% respectively. The low support for all parties reflects voters\u2019 disillusion and frustration with the rapid political changes that have taken place since 2015, peaked in 2018 with the ouster of BN followed by the collapse of the PH government 22 months later. Malaysia\u2019s Permanent Coalitions: Fading Out? When Muhyiddin assumed power in March 2021, PN then was meant to be a grand coalition of Malay and native parties including his Malaysian United Indigenous Party (Bersatu), United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), PAS and the ex-BN Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS). Now mainly the pact of Bersatu and PAS, PN would be challenged by both PH, the official opposition, and an UMNO-led BN in the next election. UMNO sets its goals to annihilate Bersatu, its splinter formed in 2016 and home to UMNO\u2019s 15 defected parliamentarians. At the heart of realignments is the fading out of permanent coalitions, the only way of multi-ethnic, multiparty power-sharing that Malaysians have known since independence. In countries where no one party can win a simple majority in the parliament, coalitions are commonly formed to ensure political inclusion and stability. But most of these coalitions are formed after election, negotiated based on seat strength and meant to last for only the parliament\u2019s term. Coalition partners are to contest against each other in the next election and which parties would form the next coalition government depends on parties\u2019 new parliamentary strength. Political Inclusion and Stability In permanent coalitions, parties stick to each other before, during and after elections. Not only do they not contest against each other, they try to pool support for each other. Parties in permanent coalitions are akin to formalised factions in parties, except that they maintain separate organisation structure, leadership and party label to appeal to different social constituencies. The idea of permanent coalition was introduced in Malaysia by circumstance. In 1952, UMNO faced a crucial challenge by its multi-ethnic splinter Independence of Malaya Party (IMP) led by its founder president Dato\u2019 Onn Jaafar in Kuala Lumpur\u2019s inaugural municipal election. An ad-hoc and local electoral pact between UMNO and the then Malayan Chinese Association (MCA) was rewarded with a landslide, soon giving birth to the Alliance which was subsequently joined by the then Malayan Indian Congress (MIC). Against the background of a Chinese-dominant communist insurgency, a permanent coalition with parties representing different ethnic groups was seen by both the British and Malayans as the only guarantee of political inclusion and stability. The Alliance model was so dominant that it was copied in Sabah and Sarawak by the local parties on the eve of Malaysia\u2019s formation. To reduce political competition, Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak merged the three regional Alliance and co-opted opposition parties including PAS into the enlarged coalition of BN in 1974. This idea was eventually copied by the opposition in 1990 after UMNO\u2019s schism between Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and his former finance minister Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah. His splinter party, Semangat 46 (S46), brought together PAS and the Chinese-dominant and secular Democratic Action Party (DAP) to form the \u201csecond\u201d multiethnic coalition as BN\u2019s alternative. A Two-Coalition System? Modelling on the British two-party system, a system of two multi-ethnic and centrist permanent coalitions was seen as the only way to dislodge UMNO-BN. Instead of PAS and DAP attacking BN from the ethnic flanks accusing UMNO and MCA as sell-outs of their respective community, an opposition united front induced their moderation with the prospect of winning power.

    "context": "WHATEVER THE shortcomings of the body of knowledge produced by the field of Economics, there is wide consensus among economists that removing barriers to international trade will benefit all countries in the aggregate. While it is true that not necessarily every single person in every single country will see an improvement in economic position, each country that liberalises its international trade regime could expect to improve its economic position in the aggregate. With the economic gain, the population of the country could collectively choose, if it so wished, to compensate those citizens that might have been set back by the process of liberalisation. Of course, in practice this does not necessarily happen; therein lies the heart of the challenge of the liberalisation of international trade: it is not an economic issue but rather one of political economy. How do we distribute the gains from trade to ensure universal support for liberalising trade? National Interest vs International Cooperation National policy, and by extension the \u2018national interest\u2019, on international trade is generally the outcome of the battle between winners and losers from trade measures. This imbues trade negotiations with a transactional and positional quality. Trade negotiators are incentivised to focus on not just what they can get for \u2018winners\u2019 but also how they might protect \u2018losers\u2019. Since it is not possible for every single country to get something without giving anything away, trade negotiations tend to become exactly that: a negotiation over what a country has to give away in order to get something. This institutional effect of domestic politics is sometimes compounded by the systemic effects of international politics that train policy makers to focus on relative gains (who gets what? will I get more than my rivals?). As a result, while economists emphasise the collective benefit of international trade, the policy makers and trade negotiators of most countries tend to approach international trade in a transactional and competitive manner. This tension between the shared benefits of an open, rules-based trading system and narrow national-interest is a long-standing feature of the international trade system. It is the classic face-off between international cooperation (or multilateralism) vs nationalism that has coloured virtually all facets of the trade regime and is often the underlying reason for the difficulty with making progress in international trade negotiations. Mercantilism in the WTO The history of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) since it was established in the mid-1990s is a vivid example of this dynamic. One of the key roles, if not the main role, of the WTO is to facilitate trade liberalisation, mainly through trade negotiations. However, the primary set of trade negotiations sponsored under the WTO, known as the Doha Round, was ultimately acknowledged to be dead after 14 years of discussions when it was buried under the inability to confer market access that largely pitted developed countries with less developed ones, all of whom focussed more on their respective national, rather than joint, interests. While an agreement on trade facilitation and one on government procurement were completed under the banner of the WTO, both are narrow in subject matter and the latter also narrow in terms of number signatories which reflect the challenge of securing wide international cooperation. More recently, the Appellate Body that is part of the WTO\u2019s dispute settlement system was rendered inoperative from December 2019 onwards because the United States unilaterally withheld support for the appointment of new members to the Body as it felt that the implementation of the system no longer served its national interest. The inability of members of the WTO to forge new trade outcomes on a multilateral basis, that is, in a way that includes all members of the WTO, has prompted member economies to seek unilateral, bilateral, regional and/or plurilateral solutions. The growth of regional trade agreements exploded in the period after the WTO was established. More dramatically were the trade wars initiated and unilateral trade measures adopted by President Donald Trump. These developments have cumulatively prompted many to question the fate and on-going relevance of economic multilateralism in recent years. The Search for First Best Outcomes This brings us back to our starting point. The demise of multilateralism in international trade might not be such a terrible thing except that there is near universal agreement that freer trade achieved through multilateral approaches would result in first-best outcomes. Anything else would lead to fragmented and less good outcomes. Recent measures related to COVID-vaccines offer a good example. In an ideal world, international cooperation would result in orderly supply of inputs to maximise the production of vaccines that are then distributed around the world to ensure that individuals are vaccinated according to universally agreed ranking of priority. Instead, nationalistic measures have resulted in disrupted production of vaccines, unproductive (and arguably unfair) hoarding of vaccines and the distribution of vaccines not according to need but instead wealth. These nationalistic measures might benefit a small handful of countries in the short-term, but it will leave the entire world much poorer and at continued risk of the virus. They will arguably also ultimately harm the small handful of countries that have adopted these measures. As the world slowly struggles to emerge out of the fog of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been a number of seminars, workshops and conferences on economic multilateralism in recent months that appear to reflect anxieties about the state of international economic cooperation. As the world ponders a post-pandemic economic future, it would be good if policymakers could heed the lesson of the virtue of international cooperation on trade (and more generally, economic) policies, exercise leadership at the domestic level and overcome their nationalistic urges at the international level.

Instead, nationalistic measures have resulted in disrupted production of vaccines, unproductive (and arguably unfair) hoarding of vaccines and the distribution of vaccines not according to need but instead wealth. These nationalistic measures might benefit a small handful of countries in the short-term, but it will leave the entire world much poorer and at continued risk of the virus. They will arguably also ultimately harm the small handful of countries that have adopted these measures. As the world slowly struggles to emerge out of the fog of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been a number of seminars, workshops and conferences on economic multilateralism in recent months that appear to reflect anxieties about the state of international economic cooperation. As the world ponders a post-pandemic economic future, it would be good if policymakers could heed the lesson of the virtue of international cooperation on trade (and more generally, economic) policies, exercise leadership at the domestic level and overcome their nationalistic urges at the international level.

    "context": "WHATEVER THE shortcomings of the body of knowledge produced by the field of Economics, there is wide consensus among economists that removing barriers to international trade will benefit all countries in the aggregate. While it is true that not necessarily every single person in every single country will see an improvement in economic position, each country that liberalises its international trade regime could expect to improve its economic position in the aggregate. With the economic gain, the population of the country could collectively choose, if it so wished, to compensate those citizens that might have been set back by the process of liberalisation. Of course, in practice this does not necessarily happen; therein lies the heart of the challenge of the liberalisation of international trade: it is not an economic issue but rather one of political economy. How do we distribute the gains from trade to ensure universal support for liberalising trade? National Interest vs International Cooperation National policy, and by extension the \u2018national interest\u2019, on international trade is generally the outcome of the battle between winners and losers from trade measures. This imbues trade negotiations with a transactional and positional quality. Trade negotiators are incentivised to focus on not just what they can get for \u2018winners\u2019 but also how they might protect \u2018losers\u2019. Since it is not possible for every single country to get something without giving anything away, trade negotiations tend to become exactly that: a negotiation over what a country has to give away in order to get something. This institutional effect of domestic politics is sometimes compounded by the systemic effects of international politics that train policy makers to focus on relative gains (who gets what? will I get more than my rivals?). As a result, while economists emphasise the collective benefit of international trade, the policy makers and trade negotiators of most countries tend to approach international trade in a transactional and competitive manner. This tension between the shared benefits of an open, rules-based trading system and narrow national-interest is a long-standing feature of the international trade system. It is the classic face-off between international cooperation (or multilateralism) vs nationalism that has coloured virtually all facets of the trade regime and is often the underlying reason for the difficulty with making progress in international trade negotiations. Mercantilism in the WTO The history of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) since it was established in the mid-1990s is a vivid example of this dynamic. One of the key roles, if not the main role, of the WTO is to facilitate trade liberalisation, mainly through trade negotiations. However, the primary set of trade negotiations sponsored under the WTO, known as the Doha Round, was ultimately acknowledged to be dead after 14 years of discussions when it was buried under the inability to confer market access that largely pitted developed countries with less developed ones, all of whom focussed more on their respective national, rather than joint, interests. While an agreement on trade facilitation and one on government procurement were completed under the banner of the WTO, both are narrow in subject matter and the latter also narrow in terms of number signatories which reflect the challenge of securing wide international cooperation. More recently, the Appellate Body that is part of the WTO\u2019s dispute settlement system was rendered inoperative from December 2019 onwards because the United States unilaterally withheld support for the appointment of new members to the Body as it felt that the implementation of the system no longer served its national interest. The inability of members of the WTO to forge new trade outcomes on a multilateral basis, that is, in a way that includes all members of the WTO, has prompted member economies to seek unilateral, bilateral, regional and/or plurilateral solutions. The growth of regional trade agreements exploded in the period after the WTO was established. More dramatically were the trade wars initiated and unilateral trade measures adopted by President Donald Trump. These developments have cumulatively prompted many to question the fate and on-going relevance of economic multilateralism in recent years. The Search for First Best Outcomes This brings us back to our starting point. The demise of multilateralism in international trade might not be such a terrible thing except that there is near universal agreement that freer trade achieved through multilateral approaches would result in first-best outcomes. Anything else would lead to fragmented and less good outcomes. Recent measures related to COVID-vaccines offer a good example. In an ideal world, international cooperation would result in orderly supply of inputs to maximise the production of vaccines that are then distributed around the world to ensure that individuals are vaccinated according to universally agreed ranking of priority. Instead, nationalistic measures have resulted in disrupted production of vaccines, unproductive (and arguably unfair) hoarding of vaccines and the distribution of vaccines not according to need but instead wealth. These nationalistic measures might benefit a small handful of countries in the short-term, but it will leave the entire world much poorer and at continued risk of the virus. They will arguably also ultimately harm the small handful of countries that have adopted these measures. As the world slowly struggles to emerge out of the fog of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been a number of seminars, workshops and conferences on economic multilateralism in recent months that appear to reflect anxieties about the state of international economic cooperation. As the world ponders a post-pandemic economic future, it would be good if policymakers could heed the lesson of the virtue of international cooperation on trade (and more generally, economic) policies, exercise leadership at the domestic level and overcome their nationalistic urges at the international level.

    "context": "GOVERNMENTS HAVE lost their status as engines of innovation in the 20th century, but that does not mean they do not have a role to play today. Through investments, policy incentives, and regulation, governments wield important tools to shape the way that technological innovation intersects with social structures. This exact intersection, especially in relation to the term \u201ctechnology convergence,\u201d is worth exploring, Scientists Mihael Roco and William Bainbridge describe technology convergence as a fusion between disciplines with shared methodologies, theories, and goals. What is Technology Convergence Technology convergence also means considering the impact on people and power structures \u2013 be it at the individual, organisational, community, societal, or global scale. To this end, the shared goals are important for governments so that a greater purpose, not just the technology, drives decisions. After providing an example of this type of convergence, the trend is examined in light of the governmental responsibilities that Roco and Bainbridge have described. These responsibilities are to set long-term research priorities and facilitate conditions to invent and deploy beneficial technologies. At the same time, they are to respect the ethical and social implications of potential uses of the technologies. The example of neuroscience converging with high-tech inventions makes the concept of technology convergence more concrete. Although decades old in ideation, hardware like neuromorphic chips and artificial intelligence (AI) systems called neural nets have recently become cutting-edge. These technologies allow computers to work quickly and learn relatively complex tasks. They derive their names from the fact that they mimic qualities of the human brain, like its structure and energy efficiency. In this example, neuroscience is not merely an inspiration, but has actually become part of the baseline for pushing forward the boundaries of high-tech inventions. Advances in neuroscience may have amplifying effects when they become integrated into the design of these cutting-edge technologies, including in AI or even brain- computer interfaces. To see the true impact of these technologies means understanding how humans interact with them, as can be learned about in social sciences and humanities. Introducing these social elements is important because technology often plays a role irritating or alleviating existing problems. Just as technology does not cause problems alone, it should not be seen as a solution itself. Responsible Innovation Technological innovation is becoming increasingly complex, particularly because it relies on the convergence between different fields. It also means that the pace of innovation may be increasingly difficult for decision-makers to anticipate. This is not because governments are no longer the primary innovation drivers, but rather because the ingredients are too numerous and fast-evolving to monitor. Governments\u2019 roles in managing technology instead relies on steering development in a way that benefits their societies \u2013 or even humanity more broadly. One moniker for this, championed by the public and private sectors alike, is responsible innovation. Responsible innovation can be carried out in accordance with the three governmental responsibilities of setting long-term research priorities, creating the favourable conditions for invention and deployment, and managing ethical and social aspects including potential abuses of technology. Instead of seeing these as separate questions, the ways they inform each other provide governments with a more robust role. Setting long-term research priorities is difficult because it involves protracted investment and the right environment to enable creativity to grow into innovation. Often this takes the form of nostalgia to replicate a \u201cSputnik\u201d or \u201cmoonshot\u201d style of innovation. Because this mission-driven, exorbitant investment may not be feasible or sustainable, it becomes more important to create the conditions for broader ecosystems to flourish beyond the grasp of government. This still includes public investment in basic research \u2013 without which many advances in computing, AI, energy storage technologies, and autonomous vehicles would not be seen today. It also includes raising the profile of technology mediators and experts in areas such as history, anthropology, the sociology of science, and ethics. The governmental role in baking the ethical and societal implications of potential technology into earlier stages of the innovation lifecycle is perhaps the most urgent one. Aligning with Human Values As inventions and societies become increasingly interconnected, more and more industries have to consider how their products and services become accelerants or irritants of societal change. To this end, the governmental role includes facilitating convergence. This means encouraging more interdisciplinary efforts and more explicit recognition of the socio- technical nexus that many innovations epitomise. Today, these conversations converge around AI ethics and governance. It is important to get these preliminary questions right because AI is a general-purpose technology, like electricity or the steam engine, that will affect all sectors. These questions become even more important when designing the governance of other emerging technologies \u2013 and AI as such can be seen as the groundwork for governance of future technology convergence, when questions of human augmentation become more mainstream.

The example of neuroscience converging with high-tech inventions makes the concept of technology convergence more concrete. Although decades old in ideation, hardware like neuromorphic chips and artificial intelligence (AI) systems called neural nets have recently become cutting-edge. These technologies allow computers to work quickly and learn relatively complex tasks. They derive their names from the fact that they mimic qualities of the human brain, like its structure and energy efficiency. In this example, neuroscience is not merely an inspiration, but has actually become part of the baseline for pushing forward the boundaries of high-tech inventions. Advances in neuroscience may have amplifying effects when they become integrated into the design of these cutting-edge technologies, including in AI or even brain- computer interfaces. To see the true impact of these technologies means understanding how humans interact with them, as can be learned about in social sciences and humanities. Introducing these social elements is important because technology often plays a role irritating or alleviating existing problems. Just as technology does not cause problems alone, it should not be seen as a solution itself. Responsible Innovation Technological innovation is becoming increasingly complex, particularly because it relies on the convergence between different fields. It also means that the pace of innovation may be increasingly difficult for decision-makers to anticipate. This is not because governments are no longer the primary innovation drivers, but rather because the ingredients are too numerous and fast-evolving to monitor. Governments\u2019 roles in managing technology instead relies on steering development in a way that benefits their societies \u2013 or even humanity more broadly. One moniker for this, championed by the public and private sectors alike, is responsible innovation. Responsible innovation can be carried out in accordance with the three governmental responsibilities of setting long-term research priorities, creating the favourable conditions for invention and deployment, and managing ethical and social aspects including potential abuses of technology. Instead of seeing these as separate questions, the ways they inform each other provide governments with a more robust role. Setting long-term research priorities is difficult because it involves protracted investment and the right environment to enable creativity to grow into innovation. Often this takes the form of nostalgia to replicate a \u201cSputnik\u201d or \u201cmoonshot\u201d style of innovation. Because this mission-driven, exorbitant investment may not be feasible or sustainable, it becomes more important to create the conditions for broader ecosystems to flourish beyond the grasp of government. This still includes public investment in basic research \u2013 without which many advances in computing, AI, energy storage technologies, and autonomous vehicles would not be seen today. It also includes raising the profile of technology mediators and experts in areas such as history, anthropology, the sociology of science, and ethics. The governmental role in baking the ethical and societal implications of potential technology into earlier stages of the innovation lifecycle is perhaps the most urgent one. Aligning with Human Values As inventions and societies become increasingly interconnected, more and more industries have to consider how their products and services become accelerants or irritants of societal change. To this end, the governmental role includes facilitating convergence. This means encouraging more interdisciplinary efforts and more explicit recognition of the socio- technical nexus that many innovations epitomise. Today, these conversations converge around AI ethics and governance. It is important to get these preliminary questions right because AI is a general-purpose technology, like electricity or the steam engine, that will affect all sectors. These questions become even more important when designing the governance of other emerging technologies \u2013 and AI as such can be seen as the groundwork for governance of future technology convergence, when questions of human augmentation become more mainstream. For governments, steering these developments can mean aligning technological development with human values to the benefit of society \u2013 as well as asserting their role in relation to evolving conceptions of power that increasingly involve technology.",

    "context": "COVID-19 HAS made salient how individual decisions \u2500 whether relating to movement, personal hygiene, and consumer behaviour \u2500 can profoundly impact others. This interconnectedness renders the private publicly relevant and thus exposes private life to public scrutiny. The effects of this social environment may wear down social trust and social capital within the community. As individual actions come under scrutiny during COVID-19, mutual surveillance has flourished. At the community level, individuals report on one another to the authorities, at times turning to social media to berate socially irresponsible behaviour which includes not wearing a mask in public and flouting safe distancing rules, amongst others. As the world eases into a new normal and society is faced with the reality that safe distancing measures will persist  in some form, the use of mutual surveillance needs to be reconsidered vis-\u00e0-vis its effects on social trust. COVID-19 and the Panopticon The intensified state of mutual surveillance creates a social environment best described as panoptic. The Panopticon was conceived by the English reformer Jeremy Bentham as a social control mechanism. It describes a prison designed to make prisoners aware of the possibility of being under constant watch. With such a prison, prisoners self-police out of fear of consequences. This idea was expanded by the French philosopher Michel Foucault to criticise the modern society disciplined through surveillance. The Panopticon has since been used as a on surveillance and control in everyday life, for example, the new embeddedness of digital surveillance in society. The Panopticon aptly describes lived reality during the pandemic, where the encouragement of mutual surveillance cultivates a panoptic social environment. COVID-19 may prompt suspicion and distrust; this forms part of our \u2018behavioural immune system\u2019. It consists of behavioural and psychological adaptations we undergo to reduce the likelihood of contact with the virus. However, because of this, life during COVID-19 is one exposed to observation and judgment from others. Individuals become more conformist and morally vigilant during a pandemic, resulting in paranoia and harsh condemnation of those who do not similarly abide by safe distancing rules. The Utility and Disutility of the Panopticon In the era of COVID-19, channelling these insecurities to enforce safe distancing rules appear to be a productive way to capitalise on pandemic anxieties. A seemingly convincing utilitarian argument supports mutual surveillance and the cultivation of the panopticon: we are currently in times of unprecedented crisis, and the urgent need to curb the spread of the virus appears to outweigh concerns of privacy. After all, conformity increases when surveillance increases. Governments are also seen to capitalise on mutual surveillance to steer the public towards safe distancing practices. In Singapore, the expansion of the government app and portal, OneServiceApp, allows the population to report cases where safe distancing is breached. Some police forces in England and Wales have also introduced similar reporting platforms. Unfortunately, the community-level, mutual surveillance can prominently manifest in pandemic vigilantism, which encompasses \u201cpandemic snitching\u201d and \u201cpandemic shaming\u201d. In Europe, there were concerns of neighbours turning on each other at the height of pandemic paranoia. The rise of pandemic snitching in Germany has sparked uncomfortable comparisons to its Stasi past, and residents in Toronto and the UK flooded emergency and police lines with reports of safe distancing breaches. Here in Singapore, the rise of pandemic vigilantism culminated in the creation of the \u201cSG Covidiot\u201d Facebook page which shows videos of individuals flouting safe distancing measures. It has gained both traction and notoriety, with many concerned about its legality and ethics due to the prevalence of doxxing and shaming on the page. Trust as a Resource However, the defence of mutual surveillance as a matter of utility obscures its long- term negative social impacts. The mutual surveillance that has emerged during the pandemic occurs through the alienation of individuals seen to flout safe distancing rules, potentially encouraging bullying at the expense of empathy; its risks fuelling social divisions. As surveillance academic Kirstie Ball notes, the conformity that emerges from such surveillance damages the quality of social relations, as it is founded on mutual suspicions and distrust. Social trust is the foundation underlying social relationships. In an ideal society, people exercise trust when interacting with others, expecting others to behave and respond in a certain way. Without trust, uncertainties and friction emerging from daily interactions erode the foundation of community and society. As characterised by political scientist Robert D. Putnam, social trust is indicative of social capital \u2500 a resource that facilitates relationships amongst individuals and enables cooperation and collaboration within society. The presence of social capital indicates that there are networks and norms of reciprocity and trust in society, that individuals are cohesive and have meaningful social engagements. The gravity of declining social capital is especially worrying during a pandemic as social capital is cardinal to resilience and long-term recovery. Social capital, accounting for the bonds which tie communities and citizens together, enables the mobilisation of community efforts and invention of new solutions born of grassroots efforts. Likening recovery from a crisis to recovery from a disease, American academic Daniel Aldrich states that it has more to do with the quality of the host than the nature of the disease. The relationship between social capital and recovery partially explains why places like New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina did not witness a vibrant recovery seen in Kobe after the Great Hanshin earthquake in 1995. The Need to Factor Trust Despite the utility of crowdsourced surveillance to clamp down on the violation of safe distancing laws, it is also crucial to recognise how a social panopticon may negatively affect trust and social capital. As Foucault argued, the effects of surveillance are permanent, and declining social capital is a cause for concern as it cannot be rebuilt overnight, requiring a longer-term approach. The recovery from COVID-19 is a lengthy process. As countries adjust to the new normal and establish new norms to navigate a post-COVID-19 reality, it is important to weigh the short-term gain of constructing a panoptic society with the long-term impacts of its blow on social capital. By trying to save many, we may jeopardise all.",

    "context": "COVID-19 HAS made salient how individual decisions \u2500 whether relating to movement, personal hygiene, and consumer behaviour \u2500 can profoundly impact others. This interconnectedness renders the private publicly relevant and thus exposes private life to public scrutiny. The effects of this social environment may wear down social trust and social capital within the community. As individual actions come under scrutiny during COVID-19, mutual surveillance has flourished. At the community level, individuals report on one another to the authorities, at times turning to social media to berate socially irresponsible behaviour which includes not wearing a mask in public and flouting safe distancing rules, amongst others. As the world eases into a new normal and society is faced with the reality that safe distancing measures will persist  in some form, the use of mutual surveillance needs to be reconsidered vis-\u00e0-vis its effects on social trust. COVID-19 and the Panopticon The intensified state of mutual surveillance creates a social environment best described as panoptic. The Panopticon was conceived by the English reformer Jeremy Bentham as a social control mechanism. It describes a prison designed to make prisoners aware of the possibility of being under constant watch. With such a prison, prisoners self-police out of fear of consequences. This idea was expanded by the French philosopher Michel Foucault to criticise the modern society disciplined through surveillance. The Panopticon has since been used as a on surveillance and control in everyday life, for example, the new embeddedness of digital surveillance in society. The Panopticon aptly describes lived reality during the pandemic, where the encouragement of mutual surveillance cultivates a panoptic social environment. COVID-19 may prompt suspicion and distrust; this forms part of our \u2018behavioural immune system\u2019. It consists of behavioural and psychological adaptations we undergo to reduce the likelihood of contact with the virus. However, because of this, life during COVID-19 is one exposed to observation and judgment from others. Individuals become more conformist and morally vigilant during a pandemic, resulting in paranoia and harsh condemnation of those who do not similarly abide by safe distancing rules. The Utility and Disutility of the Panopticon In the era of COVID-19, channelling these insecurities to enforce safe distancing rules appear to be a productive way to capitalise on pandemic anxieties. A seemingly convincing utilitarian argument supports mutual surveillance and the cultivation of the panopticon: we are currently in times of unprecedented crisis, and the urgent need to curb the spread of the virus appears to outweigh concerns of privacy. After all, conformity increases when surveillance increases. Governments are also seen to capitalise on mutual surveillance to steer the public towards safe distancing practices. In Singapore, the expansion of the government app and portal, OneServiceApp, allows the population to report cases where safe distancing is breached. Some police forces in England and Wales have also introduced similar reporting platforms. Unfortunately, the community-level, mutual surveillance can prominently manifest in pandemic vigilantism, which encompasses \u201cpandemic snitching\u201d and \u201cpandemic shaming\u201d. In Europe, there were concerns of neighbours turning on each other at the height of pandemic paranoia. The rise of pandemic snitching in Germany has sparked uncomfortable comparisons to its Stasi past, and residents in Toronto and the UK flooded emergency and police lines with reports of safe distancing breaches. Here in Singapore, the rise of pandemic vigilantism culminated in the creation of the \u201cSG Covidiot\u201d Facebook page which shows videos of individuals flouting safe distancing measures. It has gained both traction and notoriety, with many concerned about its legality and ethics due to the prevalence of doxxing and shaming on the page. Trust as a Resource However, the defence of mutual surveillance as a matter of utility obscures its long- term negative social impacts. The mutual surveillance that has emerged during the pandemic occurs through the alienation of individuals seen to flout safe distancing rules, potentially encouraging bullying at the expense of empathy; its risks fuelling social divisions. As surveillance academic Kirstie Ball notes, the conformity that emerges from such surveillance damages the quality of social relations, as it is founded on mutual suspicions and distrust. Social trust is the foundation underlying social relationships. In an ideal society, people exercise trust when interacting with others, expecting others to behave and respond in a certain way. Without trust, uncertainties and friction emerging from daily interactions erode the foundation of community and society. As characterised by political scientist Robert D. Putnam, social trust is indicative of social capital \u2500 a resource that facilitates relationships amongst individuals and enables cooperation and collaboration within society. The presence of social capital indicates that there are networks and norms of reciprocity and trust in society, that individuals are cohesive and have meaningful social engagements. The gravity of declining social capital is especially worrying during a pandemic as social capital is cardinal to resilience and long-term recovery. Social capital, accounting for the bonds which tie communities and citizens together, enables the mobilisation of community efforts and invention of new solutions born of grassroots efforts. Likening recovery from a crisis to recovery from a disease, American academic Daniel Aldrich states that it has more to do with the quality of the host than the nature of the disease. The relationship between social capital and recovery partially explains why places like New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina did not witness a vibrant recovery seen in Kobe after the Great Hanshin earthquake in 1995. The Need to Factor Trust Despite the utility of crowdsourced surveillance to clamp down on the violation of safe distancing laws, it is also crucial to recognise how a social panopticon may negatively affect trust and social capital. As Foucault argued, the effects of surveillance are permanent, and declining social capital is a cause for concern as it cannot be rebuilt overnight, requiring a longer-term approach. The recovery from COVID-19 is a lengthy process. As countries adjust to the new normal and establish new norms to navigate a post-COVID-19 reality, it is important to weigh the short-term gain of constructing a panoptic society with the long-term impacts of its blow on social capital. By trying to save many, we may jeopardise all.",
    "question": "5. What measures can be taken to balance the need for mutual surveillance to curb the spread of COVID",
    "point_form_context": "1. COVID-19 has highlighted the impact of individual decisions on the community and the interconnectedness of society.\n2. Mutual surveillance has become prevalent during the pandemic, with individuals reporting socially irresponsible behavior to authorities and social media.\n3. The panopticon, a social control mechanism, describes the intensified state of mutual surveillance during the pandemic, creating a panoptic social environment.\n4. The panopticon cultivates paranoia and harsh condemnation of those who do not abide by safe distancing rules, leading to a decline in social trust and social capital.\n5. The long-term negative social impacts of mutual surveillance, such as the alienation of individuals and the erosion of social trust, should be considered alongside its short-term utility in enforcing safe distancing practices."

    "context": "A FRIEND in need is a friend indeed. This is especially true when the whole world is reeling under unprecedented crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As maritime neighbours, India and the countries of East Africa have a long history of trade relations, as well as cultural and educational exchanges. The large and influential Indian diaspora in East Africa has often been at the forefront of these interactions. Under the premiership of Narendra Modi, however, India and the countries of East Africa have visibly enhanced their level of direct political engagement and development cooperation. Modi refers to India\u2019s increasing ties as the \u2018Indian Ocean Family\u2019 in East Africa. These include: Delhi\u2019s provision of a US$100 million line of credit under which Seychelles can purchase military surveillance equipment from India; the donation of medical equipment, notably the Bhabhatron, to support improved cancer care in Kenya; as well as the deployment of three navy vessels to deliver humanitarian assistance to Mozambique in the aftermath of Cyclone Idai in 2019. India-East Africa Healthcare Cooperation Given the current health pandemic, are there prospects for Indian-East African engagement to strengthen further, particularly in healthcare? There is considerable precedence for such cooperation. Indian pharmaceutical firms, such as Cipla Ltd. in the early 2000s and, more recently, Mylan and Aurobindo, have provided many of the generic anti-retroviral drugs imported by African states to combat HIV/AIDS. Meanwhile, India\u2019s Pan-African e-Network, first launched in 2009, has connected hospitals in 53 African countries with medical practitioners in India to provide tele- medicine training and consultations. The speed and ferocity at which COVID-19 has placed existing health systems under strain, however, begs the question of whether such health-focused cooperation remains viable and, if it is, where it may be most effective. India and a number of East African countries share an array of common challenges with the current pandemic. Each have under-resourced health systems (particularly in rural areas), young populations, significant rural-to-urban migration, urban overcrowding and large informal sectors whose workers are struggling to cope with some of the world\u2019s strictest national lockdowns. However, there are two areas in which India and its East African partners may stand to benefit from healthcare-focused cooperation. Two Areas for Expansion The first of these areas relates to contact tracing. While entailing controversy over matters of personal data privacy, the Aarogya Setu app, created by India\u2019s National Informatics Centre, is already beginning to have an impact in using Bluetooth technology to effectively track COVID-19 patients and those they come into contact with. This, in turn, is providing Indian authorities and medical practitioners with the data they require to understand the spatial dynamics of the virus and to forecast the virus\u2019 near- term spread. This brings with it the prospect of India\u2019s national and state governments being able to implement more geographically-targeted lockdowns rather than the blunt nationwide lockdown currently in place. For countries like Kenya and Mozambique, which have followed India\u2019s lead in putting in place similar \u2013 if not quite as rigorously enforced \u2013 national lockdowns, the absence of similar rigorous contact tracing data or, equally likely, an inability to actively interpret and make use of these data in real-time, may prove catastrophic. Cooperation in the area of contact tracing may pertain partially to apps development, though a number of East Africa\u2019s own burgeoning tech firms are likely more than capable to developing appropriate, if perhaps less comprehensive, equivalents. Perhaps most useful would be direct engagement by Indian policymakers and medical practitioners. As they gain knowledge and experience through Aarogya Setu, they can liaise with their counterparts in East Africa \u2013 and particularly those working at sub-national levels \u2013 to share lessons learned and knowledge on how to interpret data from contact tracing technologies and build these data into epidemiological models capable of informing intelligent and responsive containment measures. Given some of the similarities between the two geographies, Indian insights may prove more relevant and credible than engagement from equivalent authorities in the global north. Deepening South-South Ties in Healthcare The second area, perhaps slightly longer-term in focus, pertains to the education and training of health professionals. The eVidya Bharti e Arogya Bharti (eVBAB) project, launched in October 2019, builds on the Pan-African e-Network to provide an expansive e-portal, training opportunities for African doctors, nurses and paramedics. inclusive of more comprehensive tele-medicine Mauritius and Mozambique are the two East African countries being prioritised for eVBAB\u2019s initial rollout by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. While e-trainings relating to COVID-19 could potentially be useful to medical professionals of all types, a particularly impactful approach may be to use the projects\u2019 tele-medicine platforms as an opportunity for experience exchange among Community Health Workers (CHWs). CHWs are at the forefront of community-level care for COVID-19 in countries like Mozambique; the experiences of their counterparts in India, Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs), could prove invaluable in outlining \u2018best practices\u2019 for identifying, tracking and supporting COVID-19 patients, their families and communities. India and the countries along Africa\u2019s Indian Ocean coast have a long history and cultural connectedness. As India and East African states increasingly engage at the political level and as partners in development, COVID-19 provides a clear opportunity for deepening \u2018south-south\u2019 cooperation and establishing Delhi as a leader in healthcare policy and practice.",

    "context": "A FRIEND in need is a friend indeed. This is especially true when the whole world is reeling under unprecedented crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As maritime neighbours, India and the countries of East Africa have a long history of trade relations, as well as cultural and educational exchanges. The large and influential Indian diaspora in East Africa has often been at the forefront of these interactions. Under the premiership of Narendra Modi, however, India and the countries of East Africa have visibly enhanced their level of direct political engagement and development cooperation. Modi refers to India\u2019s increasing ties as the \u2018Indian Ocean Family\u2019 in East Africa. These include: Delhi\u2019s provision of a US$100 million line of credit under which Seychelles can purchase military surveillance equipment from India; the donation of medical equipment, notably the Bhabhatron, to support improved cancer care in Kenya; as well as the deployment of three navy vessels to deliver humanitarian assistance to Mozambique in the aftermath of Cyclone Idai in 2019. India-East Africa Healthcare Cooperation Given the current health pandemic, are there prospects for Indian-East African engagement to strengthen further, particularly in healthcare? There is considerable precedence for such cooperation. Indian pharmaceutical firms, such as Cipla Ltd. in the early 2000s and, more recently, Mylan and Aurobindo, have provided many of the generic anti-retroviral drugs imported by African states to combat HIV/AIDS. Meanwhile, India\u2019s Pan-African e-Network, first launched in 2009, has connected hospitals in 53 African countries with medical practitioners in India to provide tele- medicine training and consultations. The speed and ferocity at which COVID-19 has placed existing health systems under strain, however, begs the question of whether such health-focused cooperation remains viable and, if it is, where it may be most effective. India and a number of East African countries share an array of common challenges with the current pandemic. Each have under-resourced health systems (particularly in rural areas), young populations, significant rural-to-urban migration, urban overcrowding and large informal sectors whose workers are struggling to cope with some of the world\u2019s strictest national lockdowns. However, there are two areas in which India and its East African partners may stand to benefit from healthcare-focused cooperation. Two Areas for Expansion The first of these areas relates to contact tracing. While entailing controversy over matters of personal data privacy, the Aarogya Setu app, created by India\u2019s National Informatics Centre, is already beginning to have an impact in using Bluetooth technology to effectively track COVID-19 patients and those they come into contact with. This, in turn, is providing Indian authorities and medical practitioners with the data they require to understand the spatial dynamics of the virus and to forecast the virus\u2019 near- term spread. This brings with it the prospect of India\u2019s national and state governments being able to implement more geographically-targeted lockdowns rather than the blunt nationwide lockdown currently in place. For countries like Kenya and Mozambique, which have followed India\u2019s lead in putting in place similar \u2013 if not quite as rigorously enforced \u2013 national lockdowns, the absence of similar rigorous contact tracing data or, equally likely, an inability to actively interpret and make use of these data in real-time, may prove catastrophic. Cooperation in the area of contact tracing may pertain partially to apps development, though a number of East Africa\u2019s own burgeoning tech firms are likely more than capable to developing appropriate, if perhaps less comprehensive, equivalents. Perhaps most useful would be direct engagement by Indian policymakers and medical practitioners. As they gain knowledge and experience through Aarogya Setu, they can liaise with their counterparts in East Africa \u2013 and particularly those working at sub-national levels \u2013 to share lessons learned and knowledge on how to interpret data from contact tracing technologies and build these data into epidemiological models capable of informing intelligent and responsive containment measures. Given some of the similarities between the two geographies, Indian insights may prove more relevant and credible than engagement from equivalent authorities in the global north. Deepening South-South Ties in Healthcare The second area, perhaps slightly longer-term in focus, pertains to the education and training of health professionals. The eVidya Bharti e Arogya Bharti (eVBAB) project, launched in October 2019, builds on the Pan-African e-Network to provide an expansive e-portal, training opportunities for African doctors, nurses and paramedics. inclusive of more comprehensive tele-medicine Mauritius and Mozambique are the two East African countries being prioritised for eVBAB\u2019s initial rollout by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. While e-trainings relating to COVID-19 could potentially be useful to medical professionals of all types, a particularly impactful approach may be to use the projects\u2019 tele-medicine platforms as an opportunity for experience exchange among Community Health Workers (CHWs). CHWs are at the forefront of community-level care for COVID-19 in countries like Mozambique; the experiences of their counterparts in India, Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs), could prove invaluable in outlining \u2018best practices\u2019 for identifying, tracking and supporting COVID-19 patients, their families and communities. India and the countries along Africa\u2019s Indian Ocean coast have a long history and cultural connectedness. As India and East African states increasingly engage at the political level and as partners in development, COVID-19 provides a clear opportunity for deepening \u2018south-south\u2019 cooperation and establishing Delhi as a leader in healthcare policy and practice.",

    "context": "THE COVID-19 pandemic has brought an unprecedented threat to the health, livelihood and well-being of entire populations. While countries across the world continue to grapple with arguably the worst global health crisis in generations, terrorist networks of various denominations are looking to capitalise on ongoing uncertainties and insecurities to consolidate their operations and spread panic and hate. They blast online propaganda messages to followers and potential recruits by framing calamity as divine retribution. In what appears to be a new trend, White supremacists have even begun to talk about weaponising COVID-19 while sections of the Christian rightwing in the United States tried to defy quarantine orders. Weaponising COVID-19 Some have gone further, by inciting followers to launch attacks, particularly against soft targets such as hospitals and government installations. There have been reports of White supremacists planning to use the virus to achieve their deadly objectives. US federal authorities have been cited as disclosing that among the tactics talked about included using saliva on door handles and elevator buttons at government offices, and intermingling in public places \u201cwith the enemies\u201d to transmit the virus. Indeed, there is growing concern among US federal authorities of White supremacist terror. Capitalising on developments such as the COVID-19 pandemic comes straight out of the terrorist playbook by framing any natural disaster as God\u2019s will. The potential security implications warrant renewed vigilance on a global scale. This is even as governments face unprecedented health and economic challenges as the number of COVID-19 related cases and deaths skyrocket, and resources, including those of law enforcement and intelligence agencies, get stretched or diverted. Disturbing Methods White supremacist groups are touting accelerationist, siege and conspiracy theories linked to the COVID-19 pandemic to spread disinformation, sow panic and discontent and incite individuals to violence. Their messaging includes an array of conspiracy theories that play up anti-Semitic and xenophobic sentiments against, for example, China, its government and minority communities. More worryingly, US law enforcement agencies say, is the resort by some networks to use secure messaging apps such as Telegram to call for new attacks. Plans to use the coronavirus as a bioweapon against their enemies, including the FBI and non-white communities, have also been discussed. According to reports, White supremacists  are encouraging one another to deliberately spread the COVID-19 virus, if contracted, through bodily fluids and personal interactions. This includes through the use of aerosol spray bottles to disperse infected bodily fluids on police officers on the street as well as points of congregation such as markets, political offices, and places of worship. The methods of applying such biological attacks through the use of COVID-19 would appear far-fetched but are nonetheless disturbing. According to a SITE Intelligence report, a White supremacist in Missouri recently attempted to bomb a hospital, partly on the belief \u201cthe pandemic was engineered by Jews\u201d -- the attacker had in the leadup also posted conspiracy theories about COVID-19 and reposted others\u2019 call to infect doctors; this indicated that some individuals may be willing to act on such directives. Cultivating Forces Beyond mere narratives of retribution and divine punishment against their opponents, Islamist militant networks, on their part, have suggested practical ideas to their followers for dealing with the pandemic. These can often serve a dual purpose. For example, IS\u2019 call to followers to uphold hygiene standards and defer travels to Europe are also aimed at preserving their forces for attacks. Moreover, with finite government resources also redirected from military operations to address grave healthcare and economic challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, force projection at terrorist sanctuaries have been significantly reduced, including in terror hotspots such as Syria and Afghanistan. Capitalising on this, IS has attempted to grow its support base and resources, including through conducting recent jailbreaks in Afghanistan and Syria, where many jihadists remain in detention, to regain their forces. Overall, the reduced capacity of military campaigns, has provided IS networks with the time and space to retreat, recover, and recruit. Critical Infrastructure Terrorist groups have also notably raised their appeals for lone wolf attacks on state targets as well as critical infrastructure such as hospitals, particularly in Western cities ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic. The FBI also recently foiled the attempted detonating of a car bomb by a White supremacist outside Kansas City, while hospitals treating infected patients have also been identified as valuable targets. A conventional small-arms attack on critical facilities such as hospitals, particularly during times of national emergency, can completely overwhelm an already stressed medical system. The psychological impact of such an attack would also go beyond the immediate victims and foster widespread panic in the general public. Law enforcement agencies will need to be vigilant against such opportunistic attacks. On the other hand, the unprecedented measures rolled out across many countries, including nationwide lockdowns designed to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus, may have had the unintentional consequence of reducing the likelihood of a large- scale domestic terrorist attack. Physical distancing measures, which have also been widely implemented, have also significantly restricted the number of people in places of congregation, hence offering less opportunities for terrorists to launch mass-casualty attacks. The overwhelming number of law enforcement officers being mobilised to patrol public spaces has also made suspicious activity more easily detectable. Authorities could seek to harden critical installations like hospitals. For example, infectious disease treatment centres could be fortified further with additional layers of security. States can also consider decentralising their infectious disease treatment facilities to minimise the impact on their critical healthcare infrastructure, in the event of a successful attack.

    "context": "THE COVID-19 pandemic has brought an unprecedented threat to the health, livelihood and well-being of entire populations. While countries across the world continue to grapple with arguably the worst global health crisis in generations, terrorist networks of various denominations are looking to capitalise on ongoing uncertainties and insecurities to consolidate their operations and spread panic and hate. They blast online propaganda messages to followers and potential recruits by framing calamity as divine retribution. In what appears to be a new trend, White supremacists have even begun to talk about weaponising COVID-19 while sections of the Christian rightwing in the United States tried to defy quarantine orders. Weaponising COVID-19 Some have gone further, by inciting followers to launch attacks, particularly against soft targets such as hospitals and government installations. There have been reports of White supremacists planning to use the virus to achieve their deadly objectives. US federal authorities have been cited as disclosing that among the tactics talked about included using saliva on door handles and elevator buttons at government offices, and intermingling in public places \u201cwith the enemies\u201d to transmit the virus. Indeed, there is growing concern among US federal authorities of White supremacist terror. Capitalising on developments such as the COVID-19 pandemic comes straight out of the terrorist playbook by framing any natural disaster as God\u2019s will. The potential security implications warrant renewed vigilance on a global scale. This is even as governments face unprecedented health and economic challenges as the number of COVID-19 related cases and deaths skyrocket, and resources, including those of law enforcement and intelligence agencies, get stretched or diverted. Disturbing Methods White supremacist groups are touting accelerationist, siege and conspiracy theories linked to the COVID-19 pandemic to spread disinformation, sow panic and discontent and incite individuals to violence. Their messaging includes an array of conspiracy theories that play up anti-Semitic and xenophobic sentiments against, for example, China, its government and minority communities. More worryingly, US law enforcement agencies say, is the resort by some networks to use secure messaging apps such as Telegram to call for new attacks. Plans to use the coronavirus as a bioweapon against their enemies, including the FBI and non-white communities, have also been discussed. According to reports, White supremacists  are encouraging one another to deliberately spread the COVID-19 virus, if contracted, through bodily fluids and personal interactions. This includes through the use of aerosol spray bottles to disperse infected bodily fluids on police officers on the street as well as points of congregation such as markets, political offices, and places of worship. The methods of applying such biological attacks through the use of COVID-19 would appear far-fetched but are nonetheless disturbing. According to a SITE Intelligence report, a White supremacist in Missouri recently attempted to bomb a hospital, partly on the belief \u201cthe pandemic was engineered by Jews\u201d -- the attacker had in the leadup also posted conspiracy theories about COVID-19 and reposted others\u2019 call to infect doctors; this indicated that some individuals may be willing to act on such directives. Cultivating Forces Beyond mere narratives of retribution and divine punishment against their opponents, Islamist militant networks, on their part, have suggested practical ideas to their followers for dealing with the pandemic. These can often serve a dual purpose. For example, IS\u2019 call to followers to uphold hygiene standards and defer travels to Europe are also aimed at preserving their forces for attacks. Moreover, with finite government resources also redirected from military operations to address grave healthcare and economic challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, force projection at terrorist sanctuaries have been significantly reduced, including in terror hotspots such as Syria and Afghanistan. Capitalising on this, IS has attempted to grow its support base and resources, including through conducting recent jailbreaks in Afghanistan and Syria, where many jihadists remain in detention, to regain their forces. Overall, the reduced capacity of military campaigns, has provided IS networks with the time and space to retreat, recover, and recruit. Critical Infrastructure Terrorist groups have also notably raised their appeals for lone wolf attacks on state targets as well as critical infrastructure such as hospitals, particularly in Western cities ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic. The FBI also recently foiled the attempted detonating of a car bomb by a White supremacist outside Kansas City, while hospitals treating infected patients have also been identified as valuable targets. A conventional small-arms attack on critical facilities such as hospitals, particularly during times of national emergency, can completely overwhelm an already stressed medical system. The psychological impact of such an attack would also go beyond the immediate victims and foster widespread panic in the general public. Law enforcement agencies will need to be vigilant against such opportunistic attacks. On the other hand, the unprecedented measures rolled out across many countries, including nationwide lockdowns designed to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus, may have had the unintentional consequence of reducing the likelihood of a large- scale domestic terrorist attack. Physical distancing measures, which have also been widely implemented, have also significantly restricted the number of people in places of congregation, hence offering less opportunities for terrorists to launch mass-casualty attacks. The overwhelming number of law enforcement officers being mobilised to patrol public spaces has also made suspicious activity more easily detectable. Authorities could seek to harden critical installations like hospitals. For example, infectious disease treatment centres could be fortified further with additional layers of security. States can also consider decentralising their infectious disease treatment facilities to minimise the impact on their critical healthcare infrastructure, in the event of a successful attack. These security practices could also be replicated for other essential facilities, if required.",

    "context": "THE COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the speed at which the definition of money is being transformed by private digital currencies. Beyond the domain of central banks, a new cohort of private-sector agents, including social media companies (Facebook), issuing e-commerce cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin and Ethereum) are actively engaged in creating digital currencies. The pandemic resulted in a rapid shift from cash to online shopping and payments using digital currencies that have grown enormously in volume and diversity. (Alibaba, Tencent), and peer-to-peer networks firms Such digital currencies raised concerns about government-issued currency being challenged by private digital currencies. For example, Libra \u2013 offered by Facebook which has a client base of over 2.7 billion users \u2013 could eventually pose serious threats to central banks\u2019 monetary management. The growing risk of cyber attacks disrupting the payment systems, and overseas digital currencies potentially displacing domestic currencies, have all underpinned the urgency for countries to evaluate the feasibility of issuing digital currencies through their central banks (CBDC). The PBOC\u2019s CBDC The Chinese government and the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) consider internationalising the yuan an important objective as China grows stronger economically. In April 2020, the PBOC became one of the first major central banks to conduct a trial run of its Digital Currency/Electronic Payment (DCEP) in four Chinese cities, with plans to expand the tests to major metropolises. The project was fast-tracked in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike many other CBDCs under consideration, whose use will be confined to wholesale transactions between financial institutions and the central bank, the DCEP will be a retail digital currency issued through banks and payment service providers to individual digital wallets approved by the PBOC. It will allow users to transact online or offline without bank accounts. Structured as a replacement for cash, the DCEP is a centralised, government-issued, universally accessible digital fiat currency, the converse of a Bitcoin. The DCEP is structured to meet several strategic economic and political goals of the Chinese government. It is programmable, and consequently transactions can be completely monitored and recorded in government ledgers. The PBOC may be also concerned about the overwhelming dominance of the two major private sector players, AliPay and WeChat Pay that handle 93 per cent of mobile payments in China. A failure of their networks could result in serious instability, jeopardising the health of the financial system. DCEP and ASEAN As China gains economic strength, the PBOC will aim to internationalise the yuan to reduce the dominance of the US dollar as reserve currency. Since 2016, when the IMF included the yuan in its special drawing rights (SDR) basket as an official reserve currency, the yuan has achieved some, albeit, limited progress in gaining acceptance. By the end of June 2020, two per cent of total reserves were denominated in the yuan, compared to 62 per cent in the US dollar. Deeply connected with China\u2019s economy through trade, investment, travel and people- to-people links, ASEAN may be the first region to drive international usage of the e- yuan. By mid-2020 ASEAN had become China\u2019s biggest trading partner. Can China use its deepening economic engagement and growing clout to pressure Southeast Asian entities to use the yuan for transactions in trade? China's sheer weight in international trade will encourage the use of the DCEP by overseas businesses and countries. While most ASEAN trade with China is denominated in US dollar, the role of the yuan in the region and beyond is increasing. China can deploy numerous levers to expand the use of the e-yuan, including through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) which invests in more than 68 countries, and by encouraging yuan-denominated lending at the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). The PBOC is pushing for a shift from the West-dominated SWIFT system to China\u2019s own Cross-Border Interbank Payments-System (CIPS) for settlements. A digital yuan will allow China to bypass sanctions, enabling users to avoid the scrutiny of the SWIFT system that monitors cash flows on behalf of Western law enforcement and international agencies. Oil exports from Russia, Iran, and Venezuela can be paid in the DCEP, thus circumventing US sanctions. Four Constraints on Yuan Internationalisation However, four factors can constrain the internationalisation of the yuan: \u2022 The yuan\u2019s acceptance as a reserve currency will depend on trust and confidence placed on the currency. Trust is shaped by the currency\u2019s stability and track record over time, especially during periods of turbulence. So far, during periods of stress, the Chinese government has tended to revert to an interventionist mode with capital and currency controls, which will dissuade transactions or reserve holdings in the yuan. \u2022 Prospects for internationalisation will be shaped by the liquidity and depth of China\u2019s financial and capital markets, and the availability of financial instruments to hedge against currency and other risks. On these counts, although financial markets are growing rapidly in China, the yuan is not just behind the US dollar, but some other hard currencies as well. Global players in ASEAN, be they multinationals, international portfolio investors, or banks, expect to operate in a multi-currency environment with easy access to liquid, global currencies. \u2022 Prospects for the yuan will be brighter when there is stability and economic growth. However, enduring geopolitical concerns including anxiety about China\u2019s aggressive postures in the South China Sea, and other strained bilateral relationships; the tensions with Taiwan, and the US-China trade war, will deter investors from considering yuan. \u2022 The programmable nature of DCEP and complete loss of privacy, coupled with the ability of the PBOC to monitor and control the end use of money may be a deterrent for market participants considering the DCEP. ASEAN\u2019s Options To maintain autonomy in its choice of currency for international trade and finance, ASEAN needs to scale up collaboration among its members. The ASEAN Digital Integration Framework (ASEAN DIF), integral to the ASEAN Economic Community 2025 blueprint could provide a platform for enhanced discussions on initiatives for safeguarding financial stability. To address the challenges arising from DCEP, ASEAN finance ministers and central banks could consider establishing a region-wide platform encompassing common global standards and protocols that will enable ASEAN to interface with digital currencies developed elsewhere in the world, including the DCEP. Since ASEAN trades actively with other economic powers including the European Union, the United States, Japan, and South Korea, the need for competitiveness and autonomy would suggest that ASEAN maintain flexibility in its choice of currency usage. Most large businesses are diversified across several regions. They will have a strong preference for hard currencies and the lower risk and fungibility they offer in global markets. In the long-term, when the DCEP has acquired a track record and gained public confidence, it will undoubtedly gain traction in global trade and finance. In the interim, the US dollar will remain dominant in international transactions. Ultimately, the risk associated with holding the yuan as opposed to the US dollar will shape decisions.",

Oil exports from Russia, Iran, and Venezuela can be paid in the DCEP, thus circumventing US sanctions. Four Constraints on Yuan Internationalisation However, four factors can constrain the internationalisation of the yuan: \u2022 The yuan\u2019s acceptance as a reserve currency will depend on trust and confidence placed on the currency. Trust is shaped by the currency\u2019s stability and track record over time, especially during periods of turbulence. So far, during periods of stress, the Chinese government has tended to revert to an interventionist mode with capital and currency controls, which will dissuade transactions or reserve holdings in the yuan. \u2022 Prospects for internationalisation will be shaped by the liquidity and depth of China\u2019s financial and capital markets, and the availability of financial instruments to hedge against currency and other risks. On these counts, although financial markets are growing rapidly in China, the yuan is not just behind the US dollar, but some other hard currencies as well. Global players in ASEAN, be they multinationals, international portfolio investors, or banks, expect to operate in a multi-currency environment with easy access to liquid, global currencies. \u2022 Prospects for the yuan will be brighter when there is stability and economic growth. However, enduring geopolitical concerns including anxiety about China\u2019s aggressive postures in the South China Sea, and other strained bilateral relationships; the tensions with Taiwan, and the US-China trade war, will deter investors from considering yuan. \u2022 The programmable nature of DCEP and complete loss of privacy, coupled with the ability of the PBOC to monitor and control the end use of money may be a deterrent for market participants considering the DCEP. ASEAN\u2019s Options To maintain autonomy in its choice of currency for international trade and finance, ASEAN needs to scale up collaboration among its members. The ASEAN Digital Integration Framework (ASEAN DIF), integral to the ASEAN Economic Community 2025 blueprint could provide a platform for enhanced discussions on initiatives for safeguarding financial stability. To address the challenges arising from DCEP, ASEAN finance ministers and central banks could consider establishing a region-wide platform encompassing common global standards and protocols that will enable ASEAN to interface with digital currencies developed elsewhere in the world, including the DCEP. Since ASEAN trades actively with other economic powers including the European Union, the United States, Japan, and South Korea, the need for competitiveness and autonomy would suggest that ASEAN maintain flexibility in its choice of currency usage. Most large businesses are diversified across several regions. They will have a strong preference for hard currencies and the lower risk and fungibility they offer in global markets. In the long-term, when the DCEP has acquired a track record and gained public confidence, it will undoubtedly gain traction in global trade and finance. In the interim, the US dollar will remain dominant in international transactions. Ultimately, the risk associated with holding the yuan as opposed to the US dollar will shape decisions.",

    "context": "THE COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the speed at which the definition of money is being transformed by private digital currencies. Beyond the domain of central banks, a new cohort of private-sector agents, including social media companies (Facebook), issuing e-commerce cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin and Ethereum) are actively engaged in creating digital currencies. The pandemic resulted in a rapid shift from cash to online shopping and payments using digital currencies that have grown enormously in volume and diversity. (Alibaba, Tencent), and peer-to-peer networks firms Such digital currencies raised concerns about government-issued currency being challenged by private digital currencies. For example, Libra \u2013 offered by Facebook which has a client base of over 2.7 billion users \u2013 could eventually pose serious threats to central banks\u2019 monetary management. The growing risk of cyber attacks disrupting the payment systems, and overseas digital currencies potentially displacing domestic currencies, have all underpinned the urgency for countries to evaluate the feasibility of issuing digital currencies through their central banks (CBDC). The PBOC\u2019s CBDC The Chinese government and the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) consider internationalising the yuan an important objective as China grows stronger economically. In April 2020, the PBOC became one of the first major central banks to conduct a trial run of its Digital Currency/Electronic Payment (DCEP) in four Chinese cities, with plans to expand the tests to major metropolises. The project was fast-tracked in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike many other CBDCs under consideration, whose use will be confined to wholesale transactions between financial institutions and the central bank, the DCEP will be a retail digital currency issued through banks and payment service providers to individual digital wallets approved by the PBOC. It will allow users to transact online or offline without bank accounts. Structured as a replacement for cash, the DCEP is a centralised, government-issued, universally accessible digital fiat currency, the converse of a Bitcoin. The DCEP is structured to meet several strategic economic and political goals of the Chinese government. It is programmable, and consequently transactions can be completely monitored and recorded in government ledgers. The PBOC may be also concerned about the overwhelming dominance of the two major private sector players, AliPay and WeChat Pay that handle 93 per cent of mobile payments in China. A failure of their networks could result in serious instability, jeopardising the health of the financial system. DCEP and ASEAN As China gains economic strength, the PBOC will aim to internationalise the yuan to reduce the dominance of the US dollar as reserve currency. Since 2016, when the IMF included the yuan in its special drawing rights (SDR) basket as an official reserve currency, the yuan has achieved some, albeit, limited progress in gaining acceptance. By the end of June 2020, two per cent of total reserves were denominated in the yuan, compared to 62 per cent in the US dollar. Deeply connected with China\u2019s economy through trade, investment, travel and people- to-people links, ASEAN may be the first region to drive international usage of the e- yuan. By mid-2020 ASEAN had become China\u2019s biggest trading partner. Can China use its deepening economic engagement and growing clout to pressure Southeast Asian entities to use the yuan for transactions in trade? China's sheer weight in international trade will encourage the use of the DCEP by overseas businesses and countries. While most ASEAN trade with China is denominated in US dollar, the role of the yuan in the region and beyond is increasing. China can deploy numerous levers to expand the use of the e-yuan, including through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) which invests in more than 68 countries, and by encouraging yuan-denominated lending at the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). The PBOC is pushing for a shift from the West-dominated SWIFT system to China\u2019s own Cross-Border Interbank Payments-System (CIPS) for settlements. A digital yuan will allow China to bypass sanctions, enabling users to avoid the scrutiny of the SWIFT system that monitors cash flows on behalf of Western law enforcement and international agencies.

    "context": "BY NOW alarm has been raised about the numbers of people who have been infected with the COVID-19 virus after attending a large gathering of the Tablighi Jama\u2019at religious movement at the Sri Petaling mosque complex in Malaysia. The gathering, held on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur from 27 February to 1 March 2020, reportedly involved up to 10,000 people from several countries who are devotees of the Tablighi Jama\u2019at movement. The Ministry of Health is tracing the contacts of about 90 Singaporeans who attended the gathering, after two were diagnosed with the coronavirus. Having got themselves infected due to the lack of social distancing, many of the members of this group have returned to their respective countries in the ASEAN region, including Singapore, and there is worry that the virus may spread even further as a result of such large scale human movement. What is the Tablighi Jama\u2019at? Some have asked how and why the members decided to travel to the gathering in the first place, and whether such gatherings can be better controlled or even temporarily stopped as the world dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic. In the case of the Tabligh this is easier said than done, for movement is an essential feature of the group; and if we are to understand why, we would need to understand what the Tabligh. The Tablighi Jama\u2019at is a lay missionary pietist movement among Muslims that emerged in India a century ago. From the outset it has emphasised the need for individual believers to leave their comfort zones, go out into the world to face challenges and hardship, and to renounce all things worldly and materialistic. For seven years I conducted fieldwork with the movement, during which I travelled along with Tabligh members from all over the world - the United Kingdom, France and Germany to India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and to almost every part of Southeast Asia. This need to travel \u2013 which some of the members described as being on a state of permanent pilgrimage \u2013 lies at the core of what the Tabligh is as a movement of faith renewal. When the Tabligh was formed in Northern India in the early part of the 20th century, it regarded the state of Muslims as abysmal. The founders of the movement argued that the faith of many Muslims had been weakened as a result of their attachment to all things worldly (dunia) and materialistic; they believed that one has to renounce worldly attachments to be truly free to believe sincerely. I have met many members from all walks of life who have, upon joining the movement, renounced their worldly attachments and stopped doing things like watching TV, using social media, or given up smoking or drugs. Benign Movement that Moves In many ways the Tabligh was and remains a largely benign movement: It has never sought out confrontation with other faith communities (as it largely confines its activities to other fellow Muslims) and it has never had any political ambitions (for it regards politics as something worldly and therefore a distraction from faith and love for God). Outsiders have sometimes seen them as fatalistic, apolitical and apathetic to the wider needs of society, but the members would argue that one cannot change the world positively unless one has been a better and more faithful individual first. What is special about the Tabligh is that it is a movement that does not have the rigidity of parties, organisations or corporations. Membership is open to all and on a flexible basis: Some join and follow the Tabligh for a weekend a month, some for weeks or months per year, some for life. One thing that they all do is move, in order to meet other members of the faith community and to weaken their bonds to the material world around them. They do not stay in hotels when they travel (for that would be unseemly and too worldly), but choose to stay in mosques and seminaries. This is a mobile movement. In the Indonesian province of West Papua I met a young Tabligh lad who had travelled all the way to Peru \u2013 via Jakarta then to Singapore, then to Japan, then to Los Angeles on to Mexico and finally to Peru and back again. At the large gatherings of the Tabligh I have attended in Pakistan, Southern Thailand (at Yala) and Java (at Temboro) I have met thousands of Tablighs from every part of the world. Way Forward Governments are now faced with the difficult task of educating their respective populations and encouraging them to maintain a healthy social distance from one another while avoiding large gatherings. This poses a problem for movements that conduct pilgrimages in groups, and this applies not only to the Tabligh but also Christians who undertake pilgrimages along the pilgrimage trails of Europe, Hindus who visit temples, and Buddhists who make pilgrimages to shrines. So what is the best way forward with such groups? Firstly, we should remember that the Tabligh has in fact had to self-regulate its activities and movements in the recent past. Two decades ago when Indonesia was in the grip of violent militancy, the Tabligh was infiltrated and used as a vehicle by some radicals who sought to move across Indonesia anonymously. When it was discovered that terrorists had used the movement as a means to get to places like Bali, the Tabligh responded by checking on its members and ensuring that their movement would not become the vector for violence in the country. As the Tabligh is a movement of faith and cares about its members\u2019 welfare, it should be made clear to them that social responsibility is also an important value in religion. Muslim history has many examples of how Muslim rulers have imposed controls on movement in times of epidemics, and Muslim scholars have always laid great emphasis on the concept of collective social wellbeing. So rather than scape-goating or victim-blaming the Tablighi movement and its members, a better approach would be to engage them constructively while opening opportunities for them to demonstrate social responsibility. What applies to the Tabligh also applies to all itinerant movements and pilgrimage groups that likewise move from one place to another. By not singling out the Tabligh as a unique problem we avoid the mistake of adding stigma to crisis; by engaging them positively, such movements can actually play an important role in containing this virus pandemic. The underlying message ought to be that social welfare and caring for the greater good of society are also components of faith, and they are not incompatible.",

The gathering, held on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur from 27 February to 1 March 2020, reportedly involved up to 10,000 people from several countries who are devotees of the Tablighi Jama\u2019at movement. The Ministry of Health is tracing the contacts of about 90 Singaporeans who attended the gathering, after two were diagnosed with the coronavirus. Having got themselves infected due to the lack of social distancing, many of the members of this group have returned to their respective countries in the ASEAN region, including Singapore, and there is worry that the virus may spread even further as a result of such large scale human movement. What is the Tablighi Jama\u2019at? Some have asked how and why the members decided to travel to the gathering in the first place, and whether such gatherings can be better controlled or even temporarily stopped as the world dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic. In the case of the Tabligh this is easier said than done, for movement is an essential feature of the group; and if we are to understand why, we would need to understand what the Tabligh. The Tablighi Jama\u2019at is a lay missionary pietist movement among Muslims that emerged in India a century ago. From the outset it has emphasised the need for individual believers to leave their comfort zones, go out into the world to face challenges and hardship, and to renounce all things worldly and materialistic. For seven years I conducted fieldwork with the movement, during which I travelled along with Tabligh members from all over the world - the United Kingdom, France and Germany to India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and to almost every part of Southeast Asia. This need to travel \u2013 which some of the members described as being on a state of permanent pilgrimage \u2013 lies at the core of what the Tabligh is as a movement of faith renewal. When the Tabligh was formed in Northern India in the early part of the 20th century, it regarded the state of Muslims as abysmal. The founders of the movement argued that the faith of many Muslims had been weakened as a result of their attachment to all things worldly (dunia) and materialistic; they believed that one has to renounce worldly attachments to be truly free to believe sincerely. I have met many members from all walks of life who have, upon joining the movement, renounced their worldly attachments and stopped doing things like watching TV, using social media, or given up smoking or drugs. Benign Movement that Moves In many ways the Tabligh was and remains a largely benign movement: It has never sought out confrontation with other faith communities (as it largely confines its activities to other fellow Muslims) and it has never had any political ambitions (for it regards politics as something worldly and therefore a distraction from faith and love for God). Outsiders have sometimes seen them as fatalistic, apolitical and apathetic to the wider needs of society, but the members would argue that one cannot change the world positively unless one has been a better and more faithful individual first. What is special about the Tabligh is that it is a movement that does not have the rigidity of parties, organisations or corporations. Membership is open to all and on a flexible basis: Some join and follow the Tabligh for a weekend a month, some for weeks or months per year, some for life. One thing that they all do is move, in order to meet other members of the faith community and to weaken their bonds to the material world around them. They do not stay in hotels when they travel (for that would be unseemly and too worldly), but choose to stay in mosques and seminaries. This is a mobile movement. In the Indonesian province of West Papua I met a young Tabligh lad who had travelled all the way to Peru \u2013 via Jakarta then to Singapore, then to Japan, then to Los Angeles on to Mexico and finally to Peru and back again. At the large gatherings of the Tabligh I have attended in Pakistan, Southern Thailand (at Yala) and Java (at Temboro) I have met thousands of Tablighs from every part of the world. Way Forward Governments are now faced with the difficult task of educating their respective populations and encouraging them to maintain a healthy social distance from one another while avoiding large gatherings. This poses a problem for movements that conduct pilgrimages in groups, and this applies not only to the Tabligh but also Christians who undertake pilgrimages along the pilgrimage trails of Europe, Hindus who visit temples, and Buddhists who make pilgrimages to shrines. So what is the best way forward with such groups? Firstly, we should remember that the Tabligh has in fact had to self-regulate its activities and movements in the recent past. Two decades ago when Indonesia was in the grip of violent militancy, the Tabligh was infiltrated and used as a vehicle by some radicals who sought to move across Indonesia anonymously. When it was discovered that terrorists had used the movement as a means to get to places like Bali, the Tabligh responded by checking on its members and ensuring that their movement would not become the vector for violence in the country. As the Tabligh is a movement of faith and cares about its members\u2019 welfare, it should be made clear to them that social responsibility is also an important value in religion. Muslim history has many examples of how Muslim rulers have imposed controls on movement in times of epidemics, and Muslim scholars have always laid great emphasis on the concept of collective social wellbeing. So rather than scape-goating or victim-blaming the Tablighi movement and its members, a better approach would be to engage them constructively while opening opportunities for them to demonstrate social responsibility. What applies to the Tabligh also applies to all itinerant movements and pilgrimage groups that likewise move from one place to another. By not singling out the Tabligh as a unique problem we avoid the mistake of adding stigma to crisis; by engaging them positively, such movements can actually play an important role in containing this virus pandemic. The underlying message ought to be that social welfare and caring for the greater good of society are also components of faith, and they are not incompatible.",

    "context": "GOVERNMENTS HAVE lost their status as engines of innovation in the 20th century, but that does not mean they do not have a role to play today. Through investments, policy incentives, and regulation, governments wield important tools to shape the way that technological innovation intersects with social structures. This exact intersection, especially in relation to the term \u201ctechnology convergence,\u201d is worth exploring, Scientists Mihael Roco and William Bainbridge describe technology convergence as a fusion between disciplines with shared methodologies, theories, and goals. What is Technology Convergence Technology convergence also means considering the impact on people and power structures \u2013 be it at the individual, organisational, community, societal, or global scale. To this end, the shared goals are important for governments so that a greater purpose, not just the technology, drives decisions. After providing an example of this type of convergence, the trend is examined in light of the governmental responsibilities that Roco and Bainbridge have described. These responsibilities are to set long-term research priorities and facilitate conditions to invent and deploy beneficial technologies. At the same time, they are to respect the ethical and social implications of potential uses of the technologies. The example of neuroscience converging with high-tech inventions makes the concept of technology convergence more concrete. Although decades old in ideation, hardware like neuromorphic chips and artificial intelligence (AI) systems called neural nets have recently become cutting-edge. These technologies allow computers to work quickly and learn relatively complex tasks. They derive their names from the fact that they mimic qualities of the human brain, like its structure and energy efficiency. In this example, neuroscience is not merely an inspiration, but has actually become part of the baseline for pushing forward the boundaries of high-tech inventions. Advances in neuroscience may have amplifying effects when they become integrated into the design of these cutting-edge technologies, including in AI or even brain- computer interfaces. To see the true impact of these technologies means understanding how humans interact with them, as can be learned about in social sciences and humanities. Introducing these social elements is important because technology often plays a role irritating or alleviating existing problems. Just as technology does not cause problems alone, it should not be seen as a solution itself. Responsible Innovation Technological innovation is becoming increasingly complex, particularly because it relies on the convergence between different fields. It also means that the pace of innovation may be increasingly difficult for decision-makers to anticipate. This is not because governments are no longer the primary innovation drivers, but rather because the ingredients are too numerous and fast-evolving to monitor. Governments\u2019 roles in managing technology instead relies on steering development in a way that benefits their societies \u2013 or even humanity more broadly. One moniker for this, championed by the public and private sectors alike, is responsible innovation. Responsible innovation can be carried out in accordance with the three governmental responsibilities of setting long-term research priorities, creating the favourable conditions for invention and deployment, and managing ethical and social aspects including potential abuses of technology. Instead of seeing these as separate questions, the ways they inform each other provide governments with a more robust role. Setting long-term research priorities is difficult because it involves protracted investment and the right environment to enable creativity to grow into innovation. Often this takes the form of nostalgia to replicate a \u201cSputnik\u201d or \u201cmoonshot\u201d style of innovation. Because this mission-driven, exorbitant investment may not be feasible or sustainable, it becomes more important to create the conditions for broader ecosystems to flourish beyond the grasp of government. This still includes public investment in basic research \u2013 without which many advances in computing, AI, energy storage technologies, and autonomous vehicles would not be seen today. It also includes raising the profile of technology mediators and experts in areas such as history, anthropology, the sociology of science, and ethics. The governmental role in baking the ethical and societal implications of potential technology into earlier stages of the innovation lifecycle is perhaps the most urgent one. Aligning with Human Values As inventions and societies become increasingly interconnected, more and more industries have to consider how their products and services become accelerants or irritants of societal change. To this end, the governmental role includes facilitating convergence. This means encouraging more interdisciplinary efforts and more explicit recognition of the socio- technical nexus that many innovations epitomise. Today, these conversations converge around AI ethics and governance. It is important to get these preliminary questions right because AI is a general-purpose technology, like electricity or the steam engine, that will affect all sectors. These questions become even more important when designing the governance of other emerging technologies \u2013 and AI as such can be seen as the groundwork for governance of future technology convergence, when questions of human augmentation become more mainstream.

Responsible innovation can be carried out in accordance with the three governmental responsibilities of setting long-term research priorities, creating the favourable conditions for invention and deployment, and managing ethical and social aspects including potential abuses of technology. Instead of seeing these as separate questions, the ways they inform each other provide governments with a more robust role. Setting long-term research priorities is difficult because it involves protracted investment and the right environment to enable creativity to grow into innovation. Often this takes the form of nostalgia to replicate a \u201cSputnik\u201d or \u201cmoonshot\u201d style of innovation. Because this mission-driven, exorbitant investment may not be feasible or sustainable, it becomes more important to create the conditions for broader ecosystems to flourish beyond the grasp of government. This still includes public investment in basic research \u2013 without which many advances in computing, AI, energy storage technologies, and autonomous vehicles would not be seen today. It also includes raising the profile of technology mediators and experts in areas such as history, anthropology, the sociology of science, and ethics. The governmental role in baking the ethical and societal implications of potential technology into earlier stages of the innovation lifecycle is perhaps the most urgent one. Aligning with Human Values As inventions and societies become increasingly interconnected, more and more industries have to consider how their products and services become accelerants or irritants of societal change. To this end, the governmental role includes facilitating convergence. This means encouraging more interdisciplinary efforts and more explicit recognition of the socio- technical nexus that many innovations epitomise. Today, these conversations converge around AI ethics and governance. It is important to get these preliminary questions right because AI is a general-purpose technology, like electricity or the steam engine, that will affect all sectors. These questions become even more important when designing the governance of other emerging technologies \u2013 and AI as such can be seen as the groundwork for governance of future technology convergence, when questions of human augmentation become more mainstream. For governments, steering these developments can mean aligning technological development with human values to the benefit of society \u2013 as well as asserting their role in relation to evolving conceptions of power that increasingly involve technology.",

How can responsible innovation be carried out in accordance with the three governmental responsibilities of setting long-term research priorities, creating the favourable conditions for invention and deployment, and managing ethical and social aspects including potential abuses of technology?",
    "point_form_context": "1. Technology convergence is a fusion between disciplines with shared methodologies, theories, and goals.\n2. The impact of technology convergence on people and power structures should be considered at individual, organizational, community, societal, and global scales.\n3. Governments have responsibilities to set long-term research priorities, facilitate conditions to invent and deploy beneficial technologies, and respect the ethical and social implications of potential uses of technologies.\n4. The example of neuroscience converging with high-tech inventions illustrates the concept of technology convergence.\n5. Responsible innovation, which involves steering development in a way that benefits societies, is becoming increasingly important."

    "context": "THE FOCUS of the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944, led by the United States and other Western powers, was to establish a number of rules-based international economic institutions to provide global public goods. In the area of finance, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was established to provide short-term finance for macroeconomic stability, and the World Bank was created to provide long-term development finance for poverty reduction in developing countries. The General Agreement on Tariffs and trade (GATT) was established to promote an open global trading environment. In 1995, the GATT was replaced by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) which at that time had 123 member countries as compared to 164 at the present. This rules-based multilateralism has brought about unprecedented economic prosperity and social development all over the world. From Centralised to Decentralising Multilateralism Presently, however, the world is moving from the system of centralised multilateralism towards decentralising multilateralism or a multi-layered system with the WTO as the senior global institution and various regional and inter-regional free trade agreements (FTAs). The European Union (EU), Japan, and China have taken a stand against Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d and his emphasis on \u201cbilateral and reciprocal trade\u201d and signed a large number of regional and inter-regional FTAs with other trading partners. Soon after Trump\u2019s inauguration, the European Parliament gave its consent to the Canada-EU Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement. The Japan-EU Economic Partnership Agreement came in force on 1 February 2019. The EU approved the EU-Singapore trade pact in February 2019, signed the agreement with Vietnam in June 2019, and is negotiating with Indonesia, Australia, and New Zealand. EU negotiations with China for a bilateral investment agreement are also progressing albeit slowly. Japan is playing an active role in promoting regional and inter-regional free trade areas (FTAs) as the US retreats. It has played a key role in driving the 11-country Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTTP). A number of high profile officials from Beijing have recently voiced opinions about China\u2019s interest in joining the CPTPP, although no official contact has yet been made. Contested Multilateralism Japan is also working with China and ASEAN on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), Recently, India announced that it would not join the grouping. The remaining countries are expected to sign the RCEP Agreement later this year. Thanks to Tokyo\u2019s persistence, progress is also being made on a China- Japan-Korea trade agreement. China has taken a complimentary approach to regionalism and inter-regionalism, by focusing on infrastructure and physical connectivity. In this regard, President Xi Jinping\u2019s signature project, the Belt and Road Initiative, is the main game in town. How has the establishment of new regional and inter-regional FTAs, which has led to the decentralising trade multilateralism, affected the governance of international trade? Unlike the \u201ccontested multilateralism\u201d theorists who focus only on the costs, one has to consider both the benefits as well as the costs of the process. Decentralising Multilateralism: Benefits and Costs On the side of benefits, first, regional and inter-regional FTAs provide an alternative approach to liberalising trade and are useful when WTO negotiations stall, as is the case at the present time. Second, modern regional and inter-regional FTAs typically promote deeper integration as compared to the shallower integration of the WTO which mainly tackles \u201con-the-border\u201d barriers. Regional and inter-regional FTAs can therefore address \u201cbehind the border\u201d issues such as rules for protecting investments, intellectual property, environment and labour rights, and regulations on product standards that are relevant to supply chain trade which now constitutes a bulk of global trade. There are, however, a number of costs for regional and inter-regional FTAs. The first is that they are discriminatory in nature. Granting preferences to some countries effectively discriminates against trade with others which could be more efficient trading partners, resulting in potentially costly trade diversion. That said, problems with trade diversion are more serious at the theoretical level than in practice. The second category of risks associated with regional and inter-regional FTAs are the so-called \u201cspaghetti bowl\u201d effects. This arises when overlapping FTAs create a web of trade agreements with different documentation rules, inspection procedure, and rules of origin, in effect raising the transaction and compliance costs for businesses. While there is some element of truth, a number of studies including one by the Asian Development Bank and the other by the Inter-American Development Bank have found that these costs tend to be overestimated. Going Forward: Strengthening \"WTO Centrality\"? The third cost is the fear that regional and inter-regional FTAs, especially the mega- FTAs which are sizable and cover large segments of world trade and GDP, could undermine \u201cWTO Centrality\u201d mainly in litigating trade disputes. But again several other authors have found that, in actuality, the dispute settlement procedures contained in regional and inter-regional FTAs have not introduced direct competition with the WTO. A significant number of disputes tabled at the WTO have involved members of existing their bilateral regional and disagreements. On the whole, the benefits of new regional and inter-reginal FTAs and the decentralising multilateralism appear to have outweighed the costs, mainly because the latter are overstated. inter-regional FTAs using to resolve the WTO The move from centralised to decentralising trade multilateralism, therefore, may have improved global trade governance. The move could have also enhanced the resilience of Asian countries to global shocks like COVID-19 by enabling diversification of trade and supply chains. Looking ahead, a number of policy measures should be taken to manage the decentralisation process by reforming the WTO. The WTO should also enhance further its collaboration with regional and inter-regional FTAs.",

    "context": "THE FOCUS of the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944, led by the United States and other Western powers, was to establish a number of rules-based international economic institutions to provide global public goods. In the area of finance, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was established to provide short-term finance for macroeconomic stability, and the World Bank was created to provide long-term development finance for poverty reduction in developing countries. The General Agreement on Tariffs and trade (GATT) was established to promote an open global trading environment. In 1995, the GATT was replaced by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) which at that time had 123 member countries as compared to 164 at the present. This rules-based multilateralism has brought about unprecedented economic prosperity and social development all over the world. From Centralised to Decentralising Multilateralism Presently, however, the world is moving from the system of centralised multilateralism towards decentralising multilateralism or a multi-layered system with the WTO as the senior global institution and various regional and inter-regional free trade agreements (FTAs). The European Union (EU), Japan, and China have taken a stand against Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d and his emphasis on \u201cbilateral and reciprocal trade\u201d and signed a large number of regional and inter-regional FTAs with other trading partners. Soon after Trump\u2019s inauguration, the European Parliament gave its consent to the Canada-EU Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement. The Japan-EU Economic Partnership Agreement came in force on 1 February 2019. The EU approved the EU-Singapore trade pact in February 2019, signed the agreement with Vietnam in June 2019, and is negotiating with Indonesia, Australia, and New Zealand. EU negotiations with China for a bilateral investment agreement are also progressing albeit slowly. Japan is playing an active role in promoting regional and inter-regional free trade areas (FTAs) as the US retreats. It has played a key role in driving the 11-country Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTTP). A number of high profile officials from Beijing have recently voiced opinions about China\u2019s interest in joining the CPTPP, although no official contact has yet been made. Contested Multilateralism Japan is also working with China and ASEAN on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), Recently, India announced that it would not join the grouping. The remaining countries are expected to sign the RCEP Agreement later this year. Thanks to Tokyo\u2019s persistence, progress is also being made on a China- Japan-Korea trade agreement. China has taken a complimentary approach to regionalism and inter-regionalism, by focusing on infrastructure and physical connectivity. In this regard, President Xi Jinping\u2019s signature project, the Belt and Road Initiative, is the main game in town. How has the establishment of new regional and inter-regional FTAs, which has led to the decentralising trade multilateralism, affected the governance of international trade? Unlike the \u201ccontested multilateralism\u201d theorists who focus only on the costs, one has to consider both the benefits as well as the costs of the process. Decentralising Multilateralism: Benefits and Costs On the side of benefits, first, regional and inter-regional FTAs provide an alternative approach to liberalising trade and are useful when WTO negotiations stall, as is the case at the present time. Second, modern regional and inter-regional FTAs typically promote deeper integration as compared to the shallower integration of the WTO which mainly tackles \u201con-the-border\u201d barriers. Regional and inter-regional FTAs can therefore address \u201cbehind the border\u201d issues such as rules for protecting investments, intellectual property, environment and labour rights, and regulations on product standards that are relevant to supply chain trade which now constitutes a bulk of global trade. There are, however, a number of costs for regional and inter-regional FTAs. The first is that they are discriminatory in nature. Granting preferences to some countries effectively discriminates against trade with others which could be more efficient trading partners, resulting in potentially costly trade diversion. That said, problems with trade diversion are more serious at the theoretical level than in practice. The second category of risks associated with regional and inter-regional FTAs are the so-called \u201cspaghetti bowl\u201d effects. This arises when overlapping FTAs create a web of trade agreements with different documentation rules, inspection procedure, and rules of origin, in effect raising the transaction and compliance costs for businesses. While there is some element of truth, a number of studies including one by the Asian Development Bank and the other by the Inter-American Development Bank have found that these costs tend to be overestimated. Going Forward: Strengthening \"WTO Centrality\"? The third cost is the fear that regional and inter-regional FTAs, especially the mega- FTAs which are sizable and cover large segments of world trade and GDP, could undermine \u201cWTO Centrality\u201d mainly in litigating trade disputes. But again several other authors have found that, in actuality, the dispute settlement procedures contained in regional and inter-regional FTAs have not introduced direct competition with the WTO. A significant number of disputes tabled at the WTO have involved members of existing their bilateral regional and disagreements. On the whole, the benefits of new regional and inter-reginal FTAs and the decentralising multilateralism appear to have outweighed the costs, mainly because the latter are overstated. inter-regional FTAs using to resolve the WTO The move from centralised to decentralising trade multilateralism, therefore, may have improved global trade governance. The move could have also enhanced the resilience of Asian countries to global shocks like COVID-19 by enabling diversification of trade and supply chains. Looking ahead, a number of policy measures should be taken to manage the decentralisation process by reforming the WTO. The WTO should also enhance further its collaboration with regional and inter-regional FTAs.",

    "context": "ON 16 JUNE 2020, brutal fist fighting broke out between Chinese and Indian troops at the Galwan Valley, Ladakh, in the Himalayas. It is 4,300 metres above sea level, with snow-capped mountains. The area is next to Aksai Chin and near China\u2019s Xinjiang province. New Delhi said 20 Indian soldiers, including a senior officer, were killed. Both sides have been actively boosting their military hardware there. There is no settled boundary where the flare-up occurred, only a tenuous Line of Actual Control (LAC) separating Chinese and Indian troops. China\u2019s Motivations China has three main motivations behind the incident. First, Aksai Chin and Xinjiang are of strategic importance to Beijing. Aksai Chin provides China with land access to the south of the mountainous Himalayas to the Indian Ocean. China conducts nuclear and long-range missile tests at Lop Nur in Xinjiang, a region with vast oil and gas resources. Second, Beijing is irked by India's military upgrading and renewed territorial claims to Aksai Chin. This region has been under Chinese administration since the 1950s and the construction of a highway there was one of the triggers of the China-India war in 1962. Only a fragile peace prevailed, with occasional military skirmishes. China and India share a long land border whose actual length is in dispute. On 18 June 2020, Indian Home Minister Amit Shah vowed to take back Aksai Chin (by force), again irking Beijing. Through its control of significant points in Aksai Chin, such as Patrolling Point 14, China is able to gain a strong military advantage in overlooking Indian military positions in the region. At the same time, China and Pakistan have been relentlessly upgrading the strategic Karakoram Highway, something which India views with trepidation. Today, a stronger China has an assertive foreign policy, setting aside Deng Xiaoping\u2019s advice to \u201cHide your capabilities; Bide your time\u201d. Indian Ocean as a Strategic Region Third, Beijing sees the Indian Ocean as a strategic region. The United States has been strongly cultivating India, as part of its anti-China strategy. China has a strong ally in Pakistan which Beijing strongly supported since the 1970s. Over the past 30 years, Beijing has significantly expanded its engagements and presence in the Indian Ocean region. American and Indian strategists have raised fears about China\u2019s expansionism. New Delhi sees Beijing\u2019s Indian Ocean plan as anti-India. China views Pakistan\u2019s Navy as a helpful partner in tying down Indian resources in the Arabian Sea, away from the Indian Ocean region. China has strengthened ties with Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives, and Myanmar. Beijing\u2019s \u201cstring of pearls\u201d doctrine seeks a stable balance of power in the Indian Ocean region. This is one way that Beijing is reducing New Delhi\u2019s dominance in South Asia. India\u2019s Motivations India too has three main motivations. First, New Delhi sees the Indian Ocean as its own backyard. India sees China\u2019s growing presence there as a major strategic challenge. But Beijing does not view the Indian Ocean as India\u2019s sole preserve. China is claiming sovereignty over the Galwan Valley where both countries have enhanced infrastructures, especially roads, bridges, and airstrips. Second, India is, however, quite dependent on China for trade and investments. China is India\u2019s second largest trading partner. China\u2019s investments in India totalled US$26 billion (2019), compared to lower level of foreign direct investments from other Asian countries like South Korea and Japan. Many Indian companies are dependent on China for critical supplies. India has a huge trade deficit of $56.8 billion (2019), its largest with any state in the world. There are 54 Indian companies operating in China. They are in manufacturing, healthcare, and financial services. Third, India seeks to undermine China\u2019s close economic and military ties with Pakistan, New Delhi\u2019s arch rival in the region. Consequences of India-China Tensions There are a number of consequences of this Sino-Indian rivalry. One, China and India are the world\u2019s two most populous states (1.4 billion, and 1.3 billion respectively). They are both the world\u2019s emerging technological powers, and changing the global balance of power. Two, they are both nuclear-armed. A Sino-Indian war would have geopolitical reverberations worldwide. The summit diplomacy between President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is over, for the foreseeable future. Three, both China and India have very nationalistic political and military leaderships. President Xi is facing growing domestic challenges: his handling of COVID-19 is facing strong domestic criticisms; is slowing down, raising the Chinese economy unemployment and threatening key private sector activities. He has to be seen domestically as strong in foreign policy. This will boost his political legitimacy. In military terms, China is stronger than India. China is the larger spender on defence, $266 billion in 2019. India spends about $70 billion. Another Sino-Indian war would be disastrous for both. For the past ten years, Sino-Indian rivalry has steadily intensified, but remained largely stable. India and China have also been more engaged. Bilateral trade increased 67 times between 1998 and 2012. Thousands of Indian students have flocked to Chinese universities. Both sides have also held joint military exercises. Perils of Extreme Nationalism Both China and India have a nationalistic foreign policy to advance their respective geopolitical interests. China\u2019s \u201cstring of pearls\u201d doctrine has already built strong links with Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives, and Myanmar. This should not be a surprise. From Beijing\u2019s viewpoint, the Indian Ocean is critical because it links the oil-rich Middle East with an economically vibrant Asia. This will lessen Beijing\u2019s \u201cMalacca Strait dilemma\u201d, where China\u2019s oil supply passes through and is seen by Beijing as a potential choke point. Beijing is seeking to counter Washington\u2019s hostile encirclement policy. On the other hand, it is not in China\u2019s long-term interests to worsen ties with India. It will only push India closer to the US and other US partners such as Australia, Japan, South Korea and those in Europe. The Galwan Valley episode showed the perils of extreme nationalism on both sides, but Chinese media have prudently called for a resumption of Sino-Indian dialogue to restore cordial and mutually beneficial ties.",

Through its control of significant points in Aksai Chin, such as Patrolling Point 14, China is able to gain a strong military advantage in overlooking Indian military positions in the region. At the same time, China and Pakistan have been relentlessly upgrading the strategic Karakoram Highway, something which India views with trepidation. Today, a stronger China has an assertive foreign policy, setting aside Deng Xiaoping\u2019s advice to \u201cHide your capabilities; Bide your time\u201d. Indian Ocean as a Strategic Region Third, Beijing sees the Indian Ocean as a strategic region. The United States has been strongly cultivating India, as part of its anti-China strategy. China has a strong ally in Pakistan which Beijing strongly supported since the 1970s. Over the past 30 years, Beijing has significantly expanded its engagements and presence in the Indian Ocean region. American and Indian strategists have raised fears about China\u2019s expansionism. New Delhi sees Beijing\u2019s Indian Ocean plan as anti-India. China views Pakistan\u2019s Navy as a helpful partner in tying down Indian resources in the Arabian Sea, away from the Indian Ocean region. China has strengthened ties with Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives, and Myanmar. Beijing\u2019s \u201cstring of pearls\u201d doctrine seeks a stable balance of power in the Indian Ocean region. This is one way that Beijing is reducing New Delhi\u2019s dominance in South Asia. India\u2019s Motivations India too has three main motivations. First, New Delhi sees the Indian Ocean as its own backyard. India sees China\u2019s growing presence there as a major strategic challenge. But Beijing does not view the Indian Ocean as India\u2019s sole preserve. China is claiming sovereignty over the Galwan Valley where both countries have enhanced infrastructures, especially roads, bridges, and airstrips. Second, India is, however, quite dependent on China for trade and investments. China is India\u2019s second largest trading partner. China\u2019s investments in India totalled US$26 billion (2019), compared to lower level of foreign direct investments from other Asian countries like South Korea and Japan. Many Indian companies are dependent on China for critical supplies. India has a huge trade deficit of $56.8 billion (2019), its largest with any state in the world. There are 54 Indian companies operating in China. They are in manufacturing, healthcare, and financial services. Third, India seeks to undermine China\u2019s close economic and military ties with Pakistan, New Delhi\u2019s arch rival in the region. Consequences of India-China Tensions There are a number of consequences of this Sino-Indian rivalry. One, China and India are the world\u2019s two most populous states (1.4 billion, and 1.3 billion respectively). They are both the world\u2019s emerging technological powers, and changing the global balance of power. Two, they are both nuclear-armed. A Sino-Indian war would have geopolitical reverberations worldwide. The summit diplomacy between President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is over, for the foreseeable future. Three, both China and India have very nationalistic political and military leaderships. President Xi is facing growing domestic challenges: his handling of COVID-19 is facing strong domestic criticisms; is slowing down, raising the Chinese economy unemployment and threatening key private sector activities. He has to be seen domestically as strong in foreign policy. This will boost his political legitimacy. In military terms, China is stronger than India. China is the larger spender on defence, $266 billion in 2019. India spends about $70 billion. Another Sino-Indian war would be disastrous for both. For the past ten years, Sino-Indian rivalry has steadily intensified, but remained largely stable. India and China have also been more engaged. Bilateral trade increased 67 times between 1998 and 2012. Thousands of Indian students have flocked to Chinese universities. Both sides have also held joint military exercises. Perils of Extreme Nationalism Both China and India have a nationalistic foreign policy to advance their respective geopolitical interests. China\u2019s \u201cstring of pearls\u201d doctrine has already built strong links with Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives, and Myanmar. This should not be a surprise. From Beijing\u2019s viewpoint, the Indian Ocean is critical because it links the oil-rich Middle East with an economically vibrant Asia. This will lessen Beijing\u2019s \u201cMalacca Strait dilemma\u201d, where China\u2019s oil supply passes through and is seen by Beijing as a potential choke point. Beijing is seeking to counter Washington\u2019s hostile encirclement policy. On the other hand, it is not in China\u2019s long-term interests to worsen ties with India. It will only push India closer to the US and other US partners such as Australia, Japan, South Korea and those in Europe. The Galwan Valley episode showed the perils of extreme nationalism on both sides, but Chinese media have prudently called for a resumption of Sino-Indian dialogue to restore cordial and mutually beneficial ties.",

    "context": "ON 16 JUNE 2020, brutal fist fighting broke out between Chinese and Indian troops at the Galwan Valley, Ladakh, in the Himalayas. It is 4,300 metres above sea level, with snow-capped mountains. The area is next to Aksai Chin and near China\u2019s Xinjiang province. New Delhi said 20 Indian soldiers, including a senior officer, were killed. Both sides have been actively boosting their military hardware there. There is no settled boundary where the flare-up occurred, only a tenuous Line of Actual Control (LAC) separating Chinese and Indian troops. China\u2019s Motivations China has three main motivations behind the incident. First, Aksai Chin and Xinjiang are of strategic importance to Beijing. Aksai Chin provides China with land access to the south of the mountainous Himalayas to the Indian Ocean. China conducts nuclear and long-range missile tests at Lop Nur in Xinjiang, a region with vast oil and gas resources. Second, Beijing is irked by India's military upgrading and renewed territorial claims to Aksai Chin. This region has been under Chinese administration since the 1950s and the construction of a highway there was one of the triggers of the China-India war in 1962. Only a fragile peace prevailed, with occasional military skirmishes. China and India share a long land border whose actual length is in dispute.

    "context": "EUROPEAN STATES and ASEAN are increasingly finding it critical to strengthen their security and defence cooperation. This is coming at a time of growing tensions between great powers, the weakening of multilateralism, an undermining of international law and the growing consequences of global risks and threats on international security -- terrorism, confrontation in cyberspace and at sea. in particular climate change, pandemics, Participation in ADMM-Plus\u2019 activities would be a powerful symbol of closer collaboration between the two groupings in this regard, especially given that ADMM- Plus is a platform that brings together the ASEAN Defence Ministers\u2019 Meeting and its security dialogue partners (hence the \u201cPlus\u201d). A Thwarted Rapprochement As early as 2013, France expressed its wish to be able to participate in the activities of ADMM-Plus. This interest was received with caution, as the regional cooperation platform created in 2010, it was argued, needed to be consolidated before being possibly enlarged. To maintain the dialogue aimed at bringing Europeans and ASEAN countries closer together, the question of participation by non-Plus countries, as observers, was discussed. The proposed platform was in the Experts\u2019 Working Groups (EWGs), with rules of accession established. France was the first to embark on this path, followed by the United Kingdom and the European Union. Each highlighted its strengths and in particular the added value of its participation in the activities of the seven EWGs under the ADMM-Plus and its expertise in the fields covered. ASEAN members\u2019 cautious reception towards opening the platform to non-Plus countries is evident in the two documents produced in 2017 and 2018 to oversee the process of participation in EWGs activities. Three conditions were specified for accession to observer status. Conditions for EWG Observer Status & Opposition Firstly, observer status \u201cis not a guarantee or a basis for eventual membership in the ADMM-Plus\u201d, an option only available for ASEAN dialogue partners, and a status that neither France nor the United Kingdom has; Secondly, observer status excludes access to EWG meetings and is limited to activities like conferences, workshops and exercise, with a maximum of two EWGs; this is also valid for a three-year cycle of activities and there can only be one non-Plus country per activity; Finally, for the sake of inclusiveness and respect for consensus, the ASEAN countries would submit the applications for agreement of all ADMM-Plus member countries. The question is raised whether such precautions and limitations were essential to allow the participation of three candidates. Canada had also applied, while that of the EU was not considered admissible, as the rules of the ADMM-Plus precludes the candidacy of a regional organisation. Unfortunately, two Plus-countries -- Russia and China -- opposed the three applications for observership, hindering the proposed expansion of the dialogue process with the Europeans. Way Forward? Against this backdrop, how can we strengthen Euro-ASEAN relations in the field of defence and security and unleash the potential for multilateral cooperation? There is no doubt that efforts must come from both sides, both at the political and practical levels. ASEAN, under the chairmanship of Vietnam in 2020, paved the way by inviting the European Union, France and United Kingdom, as well as Canada and Germany, which recently expressed its desire to apply for observership, to speak at the ADMM-Plus Defence Ministers' Meeting in December 2020. It is significant that ASEAN and the EU decided to enhance their relationship by establishing a strategic partnership, as this was one way to stress the importance of openness, inclusivity and ASEAN centrality. In 2020, a year after France developed its strategy for the Indo-Pacific region, Germany and the Netherlands adopted their own policy guidelines for the Indo-Pacific. This has created a positive momentum within the EU which is expected to soon engage in the development of an Indo-Pacific strategy. Think-tanks: New Space for Dialogue France and Great Britain have long been active in the region in the area of defence and security, having established close cooperative relations with most of the ASEAN countries. Moreover, the EU and its major member states, Germany in particular, should develop their regional security engagement. They should also promote their already significant contribution to regional peace and security as well as their relevant expertise in the fields covered by the EWGs, which are the two main criteria for participating in ADMM-Plus activities. For their part, the ASEAN countries could possibly reconsider the rules they have drawn up regarding cooperation with non-Plus countries in order to reaffirm the principle of ASEAN centrality. As consensus in this regard may take time, a parallel path could possibly be explored by creating space for dialogue between ASEAN strategic research institutions - which exchange on a regular basis through the Network of ASEAN Defence and Security Institutions, NADI - and equivalent institutions from the EU and European ADMM-Plus applicant countries. The work carried out within the framework of NADI contributes to the development of ADMM/ADMM-Plus by promoting a shared vision of strategic issues and new avenues of cooperation, such as the security impacts of climate change. This Track 2 mechanism is a welcome source of ideas and proposals for the benefit of ADMM. Establishing regular exchanges with European strategic research institutions would promote convergences in terms of strategic analysis, a better understanding of regional expectations and the added value of Europeans, furthering the dynamic of dialogue even beyond the prospect of European participation in ADMM-Plus. Game-changer? Of course, European participation in ADMM-Plus activities would not be a game changer. Despite the success and importance of this regional platform for defence cooperation, the volume of its activities is still limited and they focus on non-traditional security areas. But the question of European participation in ADMM-Plus -- even modest -- has acquired over time a high symbolic weight, and its realisation would illustrate a shared desire to face together global challenges of increasing importance, independent of the tensions between great powers.",

    "context": "EUROPEAN STATES and ASEAN are increasingly finding it critical to strengthen their security and defence cooperation. This is coming at a time of growing tensions between great powers, the weakening of multilateralism, an undermining of international law and the growing consequences of global risks and threats on international security -- terrorism, confrontation in cyberspace and at sea. in particular climate change, pandemics, Participation in ADMM-Plus\u2019 activities would be a powerful symbol of closer collaboration between the two groupings in this regard, especially given that ADMM- Plus is a platform that brings together the ASEAN Defence Ministers\u2019 Meeting and its security dialogue partners (hence the \u201cPlus\u201d). A Thwarted Rapprochement As early as 2013, France expressed its wish to be able to participate in the activities of ADMM-Plus. This interest was received with caution, as the regional cooperation platform created in 2010, it was argued, needed to be consolidated before being possibly enlarged. To maintain the dialogue aimed at bringing Europeans and ASEAN countries closer together, the question of participation by non-Plus countries, as observers, was discussed. The proposed platform was in the Experts\u2019 Working Groups (EWGs), with rules of accession established. France was the first to embark on this path, followed by the United Kingdom and the European Union. Each highlighted its strengths and in particular the added value of its participation in the activities of the seven EWGs under the ADMM-Plus and its expertise in the fields covered. ASEAN members\u2019 cautious reception towards opening the platform to non-Plus countries is evident in the two documents produced in 2017 and 2018 to oversee the process of participation in EWGs activities. Three conditions were specified for accession to observer status. Conditions for EWG Observer Status & Opposition Firstly, observer status \u201cis not a guarantee or a basis for eventual membership in the ADMM-Plus\u201d, an option only available for ASEAN dialogue partners, and a status that neither France nor the United Kingdom has; Secondly, observer status excludes access to EWG meetings and is limited to activities like conferences, workshops and exercise, with a maximum of two EWGs; this is also valid for a three-year cycle of activities and there can only be one non-Plus country per activity; Finally, for the sake of inclusiveness and respect for consensus, the ASEAN countries would submit the applications for agreement of all ADMM-Plus member countries. The question is raised whether such precautions and limitations were essential to allow the participation of three candidates. Canada had also applied, while that of the EU was not considered admissible, as the rules of the ADMM-Plus precludes the candidacy of a regional organisation. Unfortunately, two Plus-countries -- Russia and China -- opposed the three applications for observership, hindering the proposed expansion of the dialogue process with the Europeans. Way Forward? Against this backdrop, how can we strengthen Euro-ASEAN relations in the field of defence and security and unleash the potential for multilateral cooperation? There is no doubt that efforts must come from both sides, both at the political and practical levels. ASEAN, under the chairmanship of Vietnam in 2020, paved the way by inviting the European Union, France and United Kingdom, as well as Canada and Germany, which recently expressed its desire to apply for observership, to speak at the ADMM-Plus Defence Ministers' Meeting in December 2020. It is significant that ASEAN and the EU decided to enhance their relationship by establishing a strategic partnership, as this was one way to stress the importance of openness, inclusivity and ASEAN centrality. In 2020, a year after France developed its strategy for the Indo-Pacific region, Germany and the Netherlands adopted their own policy guidelines for the Indo-Pacific. This has created a positive momentum within the EU which is expected to soon engage in the development of an Indo-Pacific strategy. Think-tanks: New Space for Dialogue France and Great Britain have long been active in the region in the area of defence and security, having established close cooperative relations with most of the ASEAN countries. Moreover, the EU and its major member states, Germany in particular, should develop their regional security engagement. They should also promote their already significant contribution to regional peace and security as well as their relevant expertise in the fields covered by the EWGs, which are the two main criteria for participating in ADMM-Plus activities. For their part, the ASEAN countries could possibly reconsider the rules they have drawn up regarding cooperation with non-Plus countries in order to reaffirm the principle of ASEAN centrality. As consensus in this regard may take time, a parallel path could possibly be explored by creating space for dialogue between ASEAN strategic research institutions - which exchange on a regular basis through the Network of ASEAN Defence and Security Institutions, NADI - and equivalent institutions from the EU and European ADMM-Plus applicant countries. The work carried out within the framework of NADI contributes to the development of ADMM/ADMM-Plus by promoting a shared vision of strategic issues and new avenues of cooperation, such as the security impacts of climate change.
