    "question": "4. How significant are social ties in facilitating the radicalisation process among pro-IS supporters?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "In the context of the radicalisation process among pro-IS supporters, social ties play a significant role. Social bonds can both facilitate and hinder the process of radicalisation, depending on the nature and strength of the ties.",
      "One claim is that social ties can provide a platform for radical ideologies to spread. For instance, individuals who are already sympathetic to extremist ideologies may be more likely to adopt them if their friends or family members also hold those views. These peer networks can provide a sense of belonging and validation for individuals who might otherwise feel isolated or marginalised, making them more susceptible to extremist messaging.",
      "Another claim is that social ties can also serve as a form of social control. Families, friends, and communities often serve as vital sources of support and guidance, and their influence can help to deter individuals from pursuing radical paths. Moreover, when links between individuals and their social networks are disrupted or weakened, the process of radicalisation can be hindered. This is because social bonds provide important mechanisms for counter-extremism, such as the sharing of alternative narratives and exposure to diverse perspectives.",
      "Lastly, the strength of social ties in facilitating the radicalisation process also depends on the specific context. In some cases, weak social bonds may lead individuals to seek out alternative sources of belonging, such as extremist groups. On the other hand, strong social bonds may offer more robust resistance to the radicalisation process.",
      "In conclusion, social ties play a crucial role in the radicalisation process among pro-IS supporters both in terms of facilitating and hindering the process. The significance of social ties depends on various factors such as the nature, strength, and context of the ties."

The primary purpose of this bill is to modernize the labor laws, make them more flexible and simplify the procedures for employers and employees. The bill also includes provisions for ensuring workers' rights and welfare.",

They argue that the proposed changes in the bill will weaken the legal protection of workers and lead to greater exploitation by employers. They also claim that the bill does not adequately address issues such as child labor and forced labor.",

They argue that the bill does not provide sufficient incentives for investment and may not be conducive to economic growth.",
      "Overall, the opposition to the \"Cipta Kerja\" bill reflects the diverse interests and perspectives of various stakeholders in the country's labor market. While the government and some business groups see the bill as a necessary reform to improve the business climate, labor unions and civil society organizations are concerned about the potential impact on workers' rights and welfare."

    "question": "1. What are the primary objectives of sanctions imposed by the EU, and how effective are they in achieving these objectives?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The primary objective of sanctions imposed by the European Union (EU) is to influence the behavior of targeted countries or organizations. The sanctions can take various forms, such as economic sanctions, trade restrictions, or diplomatic measures. The EU uses sanctions as a tool to promote its foreign policy objectives, such as the protection of human rights, democracy, and the rule of law.",
      "The effectiveness of sanctions in achieving these objectives depends on various factors, including the nature of the sanctions, the targeted country or organization, and the duration of the sanctions. Economic sanctions, for example, can be effective in bringing about change in the targeted country. However, sanctions can also have unintended consequences, such as causing harm to innocent civilians or leading to retaliatory measures from the targeted country or organization.",
      "Another consideration is the fact that sanctions are often closely tied to broader geopolitical factors. For instance, sanctions may be used as part of a broader strategy to contain or counter the influence of a particular country or organization. In such cases, the effectiveness of sanctions may depend on the ability of the EU to work with other countries and international organizations to achieve its objectives.",
      "In conclusion, the effectiveness of sanctions imposed by the EU in achieving its objectives depends on various factors, including the nature of the sanctions, the targeted country or organization, and the broader geopolitical context. While sanctions can be effective in bringing about change in the targeted country, they can also have unintended consequences and may require coordination with other countries and international organizations to achieve the desired results."

    "question": "2. How do human rights violations in Xinjiang affect the EU's relationship with China, and what role does the EU Parliament play in addressing these violations?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The human rights violations in Xinjiang, China have had significant implications on the EU's relationship with China. The atrocities committed by the Chinese government against the Uyghur Muslim community in Xinjiang have drawn widespread condemnation from the international community, including the EU. The violations of fundamental human rights, such as the right to freedom of religion and freedom from arbitrary detention, are incompatible with the principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights treaties to which China is a state party.",
      "The EU Parliament has a crucial role to play in addressing these violations. As a representative body of the European Union, the EU Parliament has the power to voice its concerns and pressure the Chinese government to take action. In 2019, the EU Parliament passed a resolution condemning the human rights abuses in Xinjiang and calling for sanctions against those responsible for these abuses. The resolution also called on the EU to consider invoking Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, which could lead to sanctions and the suspension of trade privileges with China.",
      "The EU Parliament's efforts have been complemented by the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, who has repeatedly called for the release of prisoners of conscience in Xinjiang. The EU has also stressed the need for a political solution to the conflict, which would address the legitimate grievances of the Uyghur Muslim community and ensure their rights are protected.",
      "Overall, the human rights violations in Xinjiang present a significant challenge to the EU's relationship with China. The EU Parliament must continue to press for action and hold China accountable for its actions. By doing so, the EU can uphold its commitment to human rights and the rule of law, and promote a more just and equitable international order."

Chinese businesses, which are known for their large-scale production capabilities and low labor costs, may flood the EU market and undercut European businesses in terms of price. This could lead to European businesses being forced to lower their prices or close down altogether.",
      "Another potential consequence of the CAI is a loss of control over intellectual property (IP) for European businesses. China has a history of not respecting IP rights, and it is possible that Chinese businesses may freely use European IP without permission. This could lead to a loss of revenue for European businesses and potentially hinder innovation.",
      "Lastly, the CAI may have wider economic implications for the EU. If European businesses are unable to compete with Chinese businesses, it could lead to a decline in economic growth and job losses in the EU. Additionally, the agreement could potentially exacerbate existing trade imbalances between the EU and China, with China exporting more goods and services to the EU than vice versa."

      "1. The US-EU relationship can influence the EU's stance towards China, as the US is a key ally of many European countries. The US's view on China's growing influence and military power in the region can shape the EU's perspective, leading to a more uniformed approach towards China. On the other hand, a potential US-EU anti-China alliance could encourage the EU to take a more aggressive stance towards China, leading to increased tensions between the two countries.",
      "2. The EU's economic ties with China, particularly in the area of trade, could also affect the EU's approach towards China. The EU is China's largest trading partner, and any potential sanctions or retaliatory measures from the US could have significant economic implications for the EU. This could lead to increased pressure on the EU to balance its economic interests with its security concerns, leading to a more nuanced approach towards China.",
      "3. The US-EU relationship can also be impacted by the EU's approach towards China. If the EU takes a more aggressive stance towards China, this could strain relations with the US, which is also concerned about China's growing influence. On the other hand, if the EU balances its security concerns with its economic interests, this could strengthen the US-EU relationship and lead to a more coordinated approach towards China.

    "question": "1. How does modernity contribute to the rise of fundamentalism, despite its role in giving birth to contemporary civilization?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "1. One claim is that modernity has contributed to the rise of fundamentalism through the process of globalization, which has created a global culture that undermines traditional cultural values and beliefs. Globalization has created a world in which people are more connected than ever before, and this has led to an exchange of ideas and cultures. This exchange has led to a homogenization of cultures, which has, in turn, alienated people from their traditional values and beliefs, making them more susceptible to fundamentalist ideologies that promise to restore a sense of identity and meaning.",
      "2. Another claim is that modernity has also contributed to the rise of fundamentalism through the process of secularization, which has caused people to become disillusioned with traditional forms of religion and to seek out more radical forms of religious expression. Secularization has led to the decline of religious institutions and the loss of their influence in society, leading some people to seek out more radical forms of religion that offer a sense of community and meaning. This has created a vacuum that fundamentalist movements have been able to fill.",
      "3. A third claim is that modernity has also contributed to the rise of fundamentalism through the process of individualization, which has created a society that values individual freedom and autonomy over group loyalty and tradition. This has made people more open to individual interpretations of religion, which are more likely to be fundamentalist in nature. The emphasis on individual rights and freedoms has also created a society that is less structured and less hierarchical, which has made it easier for fundamentalist movements to gain a foothold. Overall, the rise of fundamentalism in the modern world can be seen as a response to the challenges posed by modernity, rather than a rejection of it."

    "question": "2. What is the connection between disillusionment and the embrace of fundamentalist traits in modern individuals?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "Disillusionment with the world can lead individuals to seek solace in fundamentalist beliefs. This is because fundamentalism offers a sense of certainty and security in an uncertain and chaotic world. It provides a clear set of rules and principles to live by, which can be appealing to those who feel lost or disenchanted with the current state of society. Moreover, fundamentalist groups often offer a sense of belonging and community, which can be especially attractive to individuals who feel isolated or disconnected from mainstream society.",
      "Furthermore, disillusionment can lead individuals to be more susceptible to the messages promoted by fundamentalist groups. When individuals feel disillusioned with their world, they may be more open to beliefs that offer a radical contrast to the status quo. Fundamentalist groups often present their beliefs as the only truth, which can be appealing to those who feel that the world is full of contradictions and false promises. This can contribute to the embrace of fundamentalist traits in modern individuals who are seeking a sense of order and certainty in their lives.",
      "It is important to note that disillusionment alone does not necessarily lead to the embrace of fundamentalist traits. Other factors, such as upbringing, cultural values, and personal experiences, also play a role in shaping an individual's beliefs and worldview. However, disillusionment can be a significant contributing factor in the adoption of fundamentalist beliefs. Thus, it is crucial for society to address the root causes of disillusionment in order to prevent individuals from turning to extreme and divisive ideologies."

    "close_book_answer": [
      "Relativism, the belief that moral principles are subjective and relative to the individual or culture, can lead to moral nihilism, the denial of all moral value or obligation. When moral principles are viewed as subjective and arbitrary, individuals are left with no objective standard to guide their behavior. This can lead to a sense of moral uncertainty and anxiety, as individuals are left without a clear moral compass.",
      "In extreme cases, this moral uncertainty can fuel extremist ideologies that rely on blind obedience to charismatic leaders or rigid adherence to dogmatic principles. When individuals are unable to trust their own moral judgment, they may turn to external sources of authority to provide guidance and certainty. However, this can lead to a distorted and dangerous form of moral reasoning, wherein individuals embrace ideas that are at odds with fundamental human rights and dignity.",
      "To avoid the pitfalls of moral relativism and extremism, it is important to recognize the importance of critical reflection and open-mindedness in our moral reasoning. By engaging with others and considering different perspectives, we can develop a more nuanced and informed understanding of moral principles and values. This can help to prevent the kind of moral uncertainty that can fuel extremist ideologies and lead to violence and suffering."

This worldview can lead them to perceive themselves and their cause as righteous, and those they view as enemies as evil. This binary mindset can fuel their willingness to engage in violent acts against perceived enemies.",

For some, their interpretation of religious texts or teachings can justify violence against those they perceive as threatening their values or beliefs. Additionally, religious rhetoric or leaders may contribute to a sense of moral righteousness that can justify terrorist acts.",
      "3. Grievances: Often, fundamentalist groups are formed in response to perceived injustices or grievances against their community or belief system. These grievances, real or imagined, can be used to mobilize support for terrorist acts as a means of revenge or retaliation. The perception of a war between good and evil can be amplified by these grievances, as it provides a sense of moral justification for their actions.",

      "Consequently, the frequency and lethality of pro -IS attacks have declined significantly.",
      "In 2022, Indonesia experienced only one attack by JAD \u2013 the Astana Raya Bombing \u2013 which resulted in ten casualties.",
      "Notably, this attack was significantly less lethal than its earlier attacks, such as the 2018 Triple Church Bombings in Surabaya which caused 58 casualties.",
      "Despite their declining operational capacity, pro -IS groups have shown a degree of resilience in their ability to recruit members and to establish new cells.",
      "A report by the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC) noted as of 2020, that pro -IS cells continued to emerge in areas that \u201chad no recent history of terrorism\u201d.",
      "These included Pohuwanto, Gorontalo, whe re seven pro -IS men were arrested for plotting attacks, and Banjar Baru, South Kalimantan, where attack preparations were plotted.",
      "In 2021, new pro -IS cells were still forming in Nganjuk, East Java.",

      "Indonesian Pro -IS Terrorists\u2019 Radicalisation Patterns Based on information from the ITI Dataset, two radicalisation patterns among pro -IS organisations were observed to persist between 2018 and 2021.",
      "First, it was observed that most of their members wer e radicalised offline even though they were savvy with social media and the Internet.",
      "In 2018, the data showed that 67 per cent of Indonesian pro -IS supporters were radicalised through offline processes.",
      "They were mostly influenced at mosque sermons delive red by extremist ulamas (religious scholars and teachers) and at radical Quranic recital groups, both being the starting point of 80 per cent of offline radicalisation cases in 2018.",
      "While some were radicalised online by propaganda disseminated through Fa cebook and Telegram, most of them were concurrently influenced offline by extremist sermons and Quranic recital groups.",
      "In most instances, the commitment to the IS cause that developed online became stronger, manifesting into action only after it was reinf orced by group activities \u2013 as in the case of JAD Bogor and Bekasi members, Baban and Iswahyudi.",
      "Overall, the data showed that only 9 per cent of pro -IS radicalisations in 2018 took place exclusively online.",

      "A lthough the proportion of pro -IS supporters radicalised online increased from 35 per cent in 2018 to 40 per cent in 2021, many were still simultaneously involved in offline processes as well.",
      "Overall, purely online radicalisation occurred in only 13 per ce nt of cases in 2021.",
      "The second pattern that persisted in 2018 and 2021 was the role of social ties in facilitating the radicalisation process.",
      "Despite some claims that online self - radicalisation is a major threat, data actually suggested that most members of pro -IS terrorist organisations were radicalised either by or with someone they were personally familiar with.",
      "Data from the ITI Dataset foun d that 73 per cent of all pro -IS supporters who were arrested in 2018 had a social relationship with another supporter who facilitated their radicalisation process.",
      "In 2021, this percentage remained high at 77 per cent.",
      "The data also showed that the most common social ties which facilitated radicalisations were the individuals\u2019 relationships with their ulamas followed by friendships and family ties.",
      "In 2018, 32 per cent of the people radicalised involved a radical ulama they were close to, and 22 per cent involved introduction to radical materials by a friend or family member who was part of or on the way to joining a pro - IS group.",
      "In 2021, these numbers remained about the same, with 34 per cent involving radical ulamas and 28 per cent involving a friend or family member.",
      "The case of the Anshor Daulah Villa Mutiara group highlights the significance of social ties in the radicalisation of pro -IS supporters.",
      "This group, located in Makassar, South Sulawesi, was brought together by Rizaldy whose radicalisation was facilitated by Ustad Basri, his ulama while he was a member of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI).",
      "Rizaldy es tablished private Quranic recital groups and invited his siblings, their spouses, and former FPI colleagues to participate.",
      "Even tually, the group expanded to 80 people and its most infamous terrorist couples, Ulfa and Rullie along with Lukman and Dewi, went on to perpetuate, respectively, the 2019 Jolo c athedral bombing and the 2021 Makassar bombing.",
      "Looking Ahead In view of the persistent patterns of offline radicalisations involving social networks observed in 2018 and 2021, it is likely that these trends are still prevalent today.",
      "It is therefore vital for the Indonesian government to conduct two things.",
      "Firstly, it needs to collaborate with and expand the reach of civil society groups involved in the battle against extremism in offline settings.",
      "Secondly, it needs to coordinate with and support \u201cPreventing and Countering Violent Extremism (P/CVE)\u201d organisations in implementing a \u201c whole of society \u201d approach to identify and to intervene early in radicalisation processes.",

      "1. Patterns of Radicalization Among Pro-IS Organizations",
      "Between 2018 and 2021, two distinct patterns of radicalization emerged among pro-IS organizations. The first pattern involved the rapid radicalization of individuals who were previously unaffiliated with extremist ideologies. These individuals were often drawn to the IS cause through online recruitment efforts and were heavily influenced by the group's sophisticated propaganda machine. This first pattern was particularly prevalent in regions with high levels of political instability, such as the Middle East and North Africa.",
      "The second pattern involved the radicalization of individuals who were already affiliated with other extremist groups, such as al-Qaeda or the Taliban. These individuals were often disillusioned with their current groups and were attracted to the IS brand due to its perceived success and influence on the global jihadist movement. This second pattern was observed primarily in regions with established extremist networks, such as South Asia and Europe.",
      "Both of these patterns highlight the global reach and influence of IS and its ability to attract individuals from diverse backgrounds and ideological starting points. However, they also demonstrate the need for a comprehensive and coordinated response to counter the group's radicalization efforts and prevent the spread of its extremist ideology."

      "Notably, this attack was significantly less lethal than its earlier attacks, such as the 2018 Triple Church Bombings in Surabaya which caused 58 casualties.",

      "In 2021, new pro -IS cells were still forming in Nganjuk, East Java.",
      "To better understand how pro -IS cells are being regenerated, this author examined 996 court documents of terrorists arrested and convicted between 2011 and 2021.",
      "Relevant information about them were stored in the Indonesian Terrorist Inmate (ITI) Dataset, which has been helpful in our understanding of the radicalisation pathways, organisational careers, and violent operations of convicted Indonesian terrorists.",
      "The analysi s in this commentary is based on 235 cases involving members of pro -IS cells and groups arrested in 2018 (182 cases) and 2021 (53 cases).",
      "They included members from pro -IS groups such as JAD, Jemaah Darussalam al Mubaroqah, and Anshor Daulah Villa Mutiara.",
      "Indonesian Pro -IS Terrorists\u2019 Radicalisation Patterns Based on information from the ITI Dataset, two radicalisation patterns among pro -IS organisations were observed to persist between 2018 and 2021.",
      "First, it was observed that most of their members wer e radicalised offline even though they were savvy with social media and the Internet.",
      "In 2018, the data showed that 67 per cent of Indonesian pro -IS supporters were radicalised through offline processes.",
      "They were mostly influenced at mosque sermons delive red by extremist ulamas (religious scholars and teachers) and at radical Quranic recital groups, both being the starting point of 80 per cent of offline radicalisation cases in 2018.",
      "While some were radicalised online by propaganda disseminated through Fa cebook and Telegram, most of them were concurrently influenced offline by extremist sermons and Quranic recital groups.",
      "In most instances, the commitment to the IS cause that developed online became stronger, manifesting into action only after it was reinf orced by group activities \u2013 as in the case of JAD Bogor and Bekasi members, Baban and Iswahyudi.",
      "Overall, the data showed that only 9 per cent of pro -IS radicalisations in 2018 took place exclusively online.",
      "Offline radicalisation of pro -IS supporters was also prevalent in 2021.",
      "Notably, about 60 per cent of those arrested in 2021 were radicalised through solely offline means.",
      "As in 2018, mosques and private Quranic groups were the most common starting point of an individual's radicalisation, accounting for 86 per cent of all offline radicalisation cases in 2021.",
      "A lthough the proportion of pro -IS supporters radicalised online increased from 35 per cent in 2018 to 40 per cent in 2021, many were still simultaneously involved in offline processes as well.",
      "Overall, purely online radicalisation occurred in only 13 per ce nt of cases in 2021.",
      "The second pattern that persisted in 2018 and 2021 was the role of social ties in facilitating the radicalisation process.",
      "Despite some claims that online self - radicalisation is a major threat, data actually suggested that most members of pro -IS terrorist organisations were radicalised either by or with someone they were personally familiar with.",
      "Data from the ITI Dataset foun d that 73 per cent of all pro -IS supporters who were arrested in 2018 had a social relationship with another supporter who facilitated their radicalisation process.",
      "In 2021, this percentage remained high at 77 per cent.",
      "The data also showed that the most common social ties which facilitated radicalisations were the individuals\u2019 relationships with their ulamas followed by friendships and family ties.",
      "In 2018, 32 per cent of the people radicalised involved a radical ulama they were close to, and 22 per cent involved introduction to radical materials by a friend or family member who was part of or on the way to joining a pro - IS group.",
      "In 2021, these numbers remained about the same, with 34 per cent involving radical ulamas and 28 per cent involving a friend or family member.",
      "The case of the Anshor Daulah Villa Mutiara group highlights the significance of social ties in the radicalisation of pro -IS supporters.",
      "This group, located in Makassar, South Sulawesi, was brought together by Rizaldy whose radicalisation was facilitated by Ustad Basri, his ulama while he was a member of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI).",
      "Rizaldy es tablished private Quranic recital groups and invited his siblings, their spouses, and former FPI colleagues to participate.",
      "Even tually, the group expanded to 80 people and its most infamous terrorist couples, Ulfa and Rullie along with Lukman and Dewi, went on to perpetuate, respectively, the 2019 Jolo c athedral bombing and the 2021 Makassar bombing.",
      "Looking Ahead In view of the persistent patterns of offline radicalisations involving social networks observed in 2018 and 2021, it is likely that these trends are still prevalent today.",
      "It is therefore vital for the Indonesian government to conduct two things.",
      "Firstly, it needs to collaborate with and expand the reach of civil society groups involved in the battle against extremism in offline settings.",
      "Secondly, it needs to coordinate with and support \u201cPreventing and Countering Violent Extremism (P/CVE)\u201d organisations in implementing a \u201c whole of society \u201d approach to identify and to intervene early in radicalisation processes.",
      "It is important, however, that this focus on offline radicalisation is not done at the expense of combating online radic alisation."
    ],
    "question": "2. How prevalent is online radicalisation among pro-IS supporters?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "Online radicalization among pro-IS supporters remains a significant concern in the fight against online extremism. With the rise of social media platforms, radical actors have been able to easily disseminate their ideology and recruit new followers. In 2016, a study conducted by the Tripoli-based think tank, the Global Strategy Center, found that over half of the most active pro-IS social media accounts were operated by women. This suggests that women are playing an increasingly prominent role in online radicalization efforts.",
      "Moreover, it has been reported that females who support IS also play a crucial role in the process of radicalization through peer-to-peer communication, especially in cases where the male threat actor is not available or sharing content is not allowed. They act as influencers for radical thought, providing guidance on how to consume jihadist material and how to express support for extremist groups online. This aspect of the online radicalization process is concerning as it illustrates how individuals who may not otherwise have direct contact with extremist groups can be swept up in radical movements.",
      "In conclusion, the prevalence of online radicalization among pro-IS supporters is a significant concern, with women playing an increasingly prominent role in the dissemination of extremist ideology. This highlights the need for more effective monitoring and intervention strategies that address the specific needs and roles of women in online radicalization networks."

In order to address the persistent patterns of offline radicalization involving social networks observed in 2018 and 2021, the Indonesian government must first recognize and acknowledge the root causes of radicalization within its society. This includes addressing socio-economic inequality, poverty, and lack of access to education and opportunities for marginalized communities. The government must also invest in programs that promote interfaith dialogue and understanding, as well as programs that counter misinformation and propaganda that fuels hate speech and violent extremism.",
      "2. The Indonesian government should also prioritize efforts to disrupt and dismantle existing radical networks and \"hubs\" that have been linked to both the 2018 and 2021 attacks. This includes strengthening intelligence efforts, increasing cooperation between law enforcement agencies, and investing in community-based initiatives that empower local leaders and residents to identify and report potential threats.",
      "3. Moreover, the government should focus on strengthening the capacity of its intelligence and security agencies through increased training, resources, and funding. This includes investing in technology and equipment that can help identify and track potential extremists before they carry out attacks. Additionally, the government should work to improve its response to future terrorist incidents, including allocating adequate resources to support victims and their families and ensuring that first responders are adequately trained to respond to such incidents."

One of the main economic benefits of the CPEC agreement is the creation of infrastructure projects, such as roads, railways, and energy projects. These projects will increase Pakistan's exports and stimulate economic growth, as they will provide much-needed infrastructure to support the country's growing industrial and agricultural sectors.",
      "Another significant economic advantage of the CPEC agreement is the establishment of special economic zones (SEZs). These SEZs will promote foreign investment and enable Pakistan to increase its exports by providing industrial and other opportunities for businesses. By attracting foreign investment and creating new opportunities for businesses, the CPEC agreement is set to boost Pakistan's economy and create thousands of new jobs.",
      "Finally, the CPEC agreement is expected to improve Pakistan's energy situation by providing the country with much-needed electricity. This will help to reduce Pakistan's reliance on imported oil and increase its energy security. By improving Pakistan's energy situation, the CPEC agreement will help to reduce the country's energy costs, making it a more attractive location for businesses and industries to invest and grow.",

    "close_book_answer": [
      "The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) agreement is a significant development for Pakistan, as it aims to promote economic growth and infrastructure development. However, there are several potential risks and challenges associated with this agreement.",
      "Firstly, there are concerns about the potential economic burden on Pakistan. While CPEC is expected to bring significant investment and growth to Pakistan, it will also require a large amount of debt to be taken on by the Pakistani government. This could lead to a situation where Pakistan is unable to repay its debts, resulting in a financial crisis.",
      "Secondly, there are concerns about the environmental impact of CPEC. The construction of infrastructure, such as highways and power plants, can cause significant damage to the environment. This could result in irreversible damage to natural habitats, species, and ecosystem services.",
      "Thirdly, there are security risks associated with CPEC. The construction of CPEC infrastructure passes through areas that are prone to violence and terrorism. This could result in attacks on construction sites, making it difficult to complete projects on schedule. Additionally, the security risks associated with CPEC could lead to a destabilization of the region, resulting in a cycle of violence and conflict.",
      "Overall, it is important for the Pakistani government to carefully consider the potential risks and challenges associated with CPEC. While the benefits of this agreement are significant, it is crucial to ensure that the costs do not outweigh the benefits."

Firstly, it could provide a more accessible and affordable means of transactions for the large population of unbanked and underbanked individuals in the ASEAN region. Many people in the region are currently excluded from the formal banking system and may not have access to traditional financial services. An ASEAN digital currency could potentially bridge this gap and provide a way for these individuals to participate in the digital economy.",
      "Secondly, an ASEAN digital currency could help to reduce the costs associated with cross-border transactions within the region. Currently, international money transfers within ASEAN can be expensive and time-consuming, which can be a barrier to trade and investment. An ASEAN digital currency could potentially make these transactions faster, cheaper and more efficient, which would benefit both individuals and businesses in the region.",
      "Finally, an ASEAN digital currency could potentially help to mitigate the impact of external economic shocks on the region. As the ASEAN region is highly integrated and interdependent, any economic shock in one country can have ripple effects on others. By diversifying away from traditional fiat currencies, such as the US dollar, and creating a regional digital currency, ASEAN countries could potentially reduce their exposure to currency fluctuations and mitigate the impact of external economic shocks."

    "question": "3. What role could an ASEAN digital currency play in preserving the regional group's financial and political centrality?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "Claim 1: An ASEAN digital currency could potentially strengthen the bloc's financial and political centrality by promoting regional economic integration and cooperation. By creating a digital currency that is accepted across all ASEAN member states, it would facilitate transactions and trade among the countries, thus fostering a more interconnected and cohesive regional economy. This could lead to increased investment, growth, and stability in the region.",
      "Claim 2: An ASEAN digital currency could also enhance the bloc's political centrality by providing a more resilient financial system that is less dependent on external powers. With a digital currency, ASEAN member states could conduct transactions and trade without relying on traditional financial institutions that may be subject to international sanctions or other external influences. This would give the bloc greater financial independence and resilience vis-a-vis external powers.",
      "Claim 3: However, the development and implementation of an ASEAN digital currency would require significant cooperation and coordination among member states. This could be challenging given the diverse economic, political, and social systems within the region. Additionally, the adoption and use of a digital currency may require significant investments in technology and infrastructure, which may be a challenge for some ASEAN countries. Therefore, while an ASEAN digital currency has the potential to strengthen the bloc's financial and political centrality, its success would depend on effective cooperation, coordination, and investments among member states."

    "question": "5. What potential unintended consequences could arise from the adoption of an ASEAN digital currency, and how can these be mitigated?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The adoption of an ASEAN digital currency has the potential to bring about several unintended consequences. One such consequence is the potential for inflation, as the increased supply of digital currency could lead to a depreciation in its value relative to national currencies. Additionally, the adoption of a digital currency could potentially exacerbate income inequality, as those with access to digital financial services may benefit more than those without.",
      "To mitigate these potential unintended consequences, ASEAN member states could consider implementing measures to control the supply of the digital currency and ensure its value remains stable over time. This could involve a rigorous process for evaluating the need for additional supply and setting limits on the growth of the digital currency's supply.",
      "Furthermore, ASEAN member states could also consider implementing measures to increase access to digital financial services for all citizens, rather than just those with access to traditional banking services. This could include measures such as expanding digital payment infrastructure and providing financial education and literacy programs to help citizens make informed decisions about their finances.",
      "Overall, the adoption of an ASEAN digital currency has the potential to bring about both positive and negative consequences. To mitigate the negative consequences, ASEAN member states must carefully consider the potential risks and implement appropriate measures to manage them."

Firstly, it is a critical location for trade and commerce, with numerous ports and shipping lanes connecting India, China, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. The Bay of Bengal also contains rich natural resources, including oil, gas, and minerals, which have contributed to the economic growth of the region (Rowlatt, 2019).",
      "Secondly, the Bay of Bengal is strategically located, with the Andaman Sea connecting to the South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean. It is therefore a crucial gateway for trade and energy supply chains, with the potential to impact global energy security and stability (Chung & Vu, 2019).",
      "Lastly, the Bay of Bengal region is home to a diverse range of cultures, languages, and ethnicities, which have contributed to its complex and dynamic nature. The region has historically been a melting pot of trade and cultural exchange, with the influence of the Maritime Silk Road and the spice trade being evident (Bose, 2017).",

      "The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) is a regional organization comprising of seven member states in the Bay of Bengal region. However, despite its potential to promote economic and social cooperation among its member states, BIMSTEC faces several challenges in advancing concrete cooperation.",
      "Firstly, while BIMSTEC has a focus on expanding trade and economic ties among its member states, there is a lack of concrete progress in the implementation of its agreements and initiatives. Additionally, there is a significant gap between the levels of economic development of the member states, with some members being significantly more developed than others, making it difficult to create a level playing field for cooperation.",
      "Secondly, BIMSTEC's member states have varying priorities and interests, which makes it challenging to reach a consensus on key issues. For example, some member states may prioritize trade and economic integration while others may focus on security and regional integration. This diversity of interests can hinder the organization's ability to advance cooperation in key areas such as trade, investment, and connectivity.",
      "Finally, BIMSTEC is often overshadowed by other regional organizations such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which has a greater level of political and economic integration, and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), which has a larger population. This lack of attention and visibility can limit the organization's ability to attract investment, resources, and attention from external partners.",
      "In conclusion, BIMSTEC faces several challenges in advancing concrete cooperation among its member states, including the lack of progress in implementing its agreements and initiatives, the diversity of interests among member states, and the limited attention and visibility of the organization compared to other regional organizations. To overcome these challenges, BIMSTEC needs to prioritize the implementation of its agreements, take into account the varying interests of its member states, and increase its visibility and attraction to external partners."

    "question": "5. How can BIMSTEC contribute to regional integration and collaboration in the Bay of Bengal region?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multisectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) is a regional organization that comprises seven member states in the Bay of Bengal region. The organization aims to promote economic, technical, and cultural cooperation among its members. To explore how BIMSTEC can contribute to regional integration and collaboration in the Bay of Bengal region, we can analyze the following three claims:",
      "Firstly, BIMSTEC can facilitate regional integration by promoting trade and investment among its member states. BIMSTEC members are home to around 1.7 billion people and have a combined gross domestic product (GDP) of more than $3 trillion. The region has significant potential for economic growth and development, and BIMSTEC can help unlock this potential by facilitating trade and investment flows within the region. For instance, the organization can work on reducing trade barriers, facilitating the movement of goods and services, and promoting investment in key sectors such as infrastructure, tourism, and information technology.",
      "Secondly, BIMSTEC can enhance regional collaboration by promoting cultural exchange and people-to-people contact. The region is rich in cultural diversity, and BIMSTEC can play a critical role in promoting cultural exchange and understanding among its member states. The organization can work on initiatives such as exchange programs for students, artists, and scholars, as well as cultural festivals and events that can promote cultural exchange and collaboration. This can help build trust and foster a sense of shared identity among the member states.",
      "Lastly, BIMSTEC can contribute to regional integration and collaboration by promoting environmental sustainability and protecting the Bay of Bengal ecosystem. The region is vulnerable to various environmental challenges, including climate change, pollution, and overfishing. BIMSTEC can work on initiatives such as clean energy projects, waste management programs, and conservation efforts to protect the Bay of Bengal ecosystem. This can help promote sustainable development and ensure that the region's natural resources are used in a responsible and sustainable manner.",
      "In conclusion, BIMSTEC has the potential to contribute significantly to regional integration and collaboration in the Bay of Bengal region. By promoting trade and investment, cultural exchange, and environmental sustainability, BIMSTEC can help unlock the region's economic potential, promote cultural exchange and understanding, and protect the Bay of Bengal ecosystem."

Furthermore, the ADC could potentially address issues of economic inequality in the region by providing a more stable and accessible form of currency for individuals in rural or impoverished areas.

      "1. Establishing a unified blockchain standard: One of the main challenges to implementing an ASEAN Coin is establishing a unified standard for blockchain technology across the ten ASEAN member states. Each country may have different regulatory frameworks, technical specifications, and levels of digital infrastructure, which can make it difficult to ensure interoperability and compatibility between different ASEAN Coin implementations.",
      "2. Ensuring privacy and security: Given that digital assets and cryptocurrencies are highly susceptible to hacking and cybercrime, ensuring the privacy and security of transactions and user data is crucial for the success of an ASEAN Coin. Adequate security measures and regulatory frameworks must be implemented to prevent fraud, money laundering, and other criminal activities that may undermine public trust in the new currency.",
      "3. Overcoming technical challenges: The development and implementation of an ASEAN Coin will require significant technical expertise and resources. There may be challenges related to scalability, interoperability, and integration with existing financial systems, as well as challenges related to user adoption and educational barriers. Addressing these technical challenges will require collaboration between governments, financial institutions, and technology companies, as well as ongoing research and development to ensure the currency remains relevant and competitive in the rapidly-evolving digital economy.",
      "To address these challenges, a coordinated effort will be needed from all ten ASEAN member states to establish a unified standard for blockchain technology and ensure regulatory consistency across the region. This may involve sharing best practices, conducting joint research and development initiatives, and providing training and education to stakeholders involved in the implementation of the ASEAN Coin. Additionally, public-private partnerships and collaborations between governments, financial institutions, and technology companies can help to share the costs and risks of the new currency, while also promoting innovation and technological advancement. Finally, ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the ASEAN Coin's performance and user feedback will be essential to identifying and addressing any ongoing technical or regulatory challenges."

      "COMMENTARY CHINA MADE waves recently i n financial circles when it trialled its Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) \u2013 a digital renminbi \u2013 across four cities in April 2020.",
      "The trial was expanded when the People\u2019s Bank of China announced that the city of Shenzhen will distribute RMB10 mi llion (around S$2 million), for free, in a lottery system to residents, which they can spend the e -renminbi in selected merchants and in their city\u2019s metro system.",
      "The lottery was oversubscribed with two million registrants vying for 50,000 digital \u2018red pa ckets\u2019, each worth 200 Chinese yuan.",
      "The Chinese experience catalysed a wave of discussions by central banks around the world \u2013 how best to harness and implement a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), and what good will it bring to the state? It is worth bearing in mind that CBDCs are not the sole remit of nation states as regional groupings are showing keen interest as well.",
      "Regional Interests & ASEAN Digital Currency? The European Union, for example, has accelerated its efforts into studying how a digital euro could be initiated and public consultations have taken place since 12 October this year.",
      "While the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) recently introduced a single currency (the eco), crypto -enthusiasts pointed out how this was a missed opportunity to digitalise the currency on blockchain technology.",
      "It is timely, then, for ASEAN to kickstart discussions on the possibility of a CDBC and how such an \u2018ASEAN Coin\u2019 might look like.",
      "The most obvious benefit of an ASEAN digital currency is that it would dramatically lower cross -border transactions and payments.",
      "Where a company would previously exchange currency to pay for cross -border goods or services, an ASEAN digital currency promises to cut out middleman costs for currency exchanges and make payments instantaneously.",
      "Plugged in with the latest developments in the sphere of \u2018decentralised finance\u2019 and \u2018smart contracts\u2019, it has the potential to be radically transformative.",
      "This would also be synergistic with existing ASEAN projects su ch as the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), ASEAN Investment Area (AIA) and the ASEAN Connectivity 2025 roadmap.",
      "An ASEAN Coin can certainly be catalytic to the emphasis on establishing ASEAN as a \u201csingle market and production base\u201d and having a \u201cfree and open investment regime\u201d.",
      "Second, a 2019 Bain report suggests that seven out of 10 Southeast Asians are underbanked or unbanked, having \u201cno access to c redit cards or have no long -term savings product\u201d or \u201cwithout access to a basic bank account\u201d.",
      "An ASEAN digital currency can bring financial inclusion to the millions of unbanked and underbanked ASEAN citizens and small businesses.",
      "For example, a fisherm an in Indonesia could theoretically be plugged into the ASEAN financial ecosystem with a smartphone \u2013 and do business directly with other ASEAN companies and end consumers - without holding a bank account.",
      "Promoting ASEAN Financial & Political Centrality Third, an ASEAN digital currency can help the bloc preserve its financial and political centrality.",
      "Given the maturity of the Chinese e -renminbi, it is only a matter of time before it gets rolled out nationally.",
      "When that happens, the next natural step is to blend the e -renminbi into its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and regional diplomatic efforts.",
      "It is reported that merchants in Seoul \u2019s Myeongdong District (which sees substantial Chinese tourists) are open to transacting in the e -renminbi.",
      "Given that Alipay and WeChat are already common payment options in much of Southeast Asia, it would be rather frictionless to transit into the e -Renminbi system.",
      "In any event, having an ASEAN CBDC could bolster the regional group\u2019s financial autonomy \u2013 ensuring that it does not have to rely on any major power for financial inclusion or be overly dependent on extra -mural forces for its fintech archit ecture.",
      "To be sure, ASEAN countries are already at various stages of developing their own CBDCs.",
      "Singapore and Thailand\u2019s experimentations with CBDCs are at a very mature stage and could see pilot implementations shortly.",
      "Other ASEAN countries such as the Philippines are considering introducing a CBDC.",
      "In that way, technical know -how and expert knowledge already exist at the ASEAN level to get things going.",
      "Vision of ASEAN Coin & Its Challenges Notwithstanding the potential for ASEAN countries to create an ASEAN Coin, there remain considerable challenges to realising this vision.",
      "First, digital infrastructures differ significantly.",
      "A few countries are substantially ahead of others in having robust and technically sound digital eco -systems.",
      "Singapore, fo r instance, ranks fourth worldwide in the global connectivity index and has a mobile penetration rate of around 150 per cent.",
      "This is far higher than Laos, which saw its mobile penetration rates reach only 54 per cent in 2017, while Internet penetration ra tes stood at 43 per cent in January 2020.",
      "Next, and perhaps the biggest challenge is to convince political leaders that an ASEAN digital currency do not necessarily have to entail a pooling of sovereignty nor having a single monetary system.",
      "An ASEAN wide digital currency could model itself after Facebook\u2019s Libra template \u2013 pegging it to a basket of ASEAN currencies \u2013 thus ensuring price stability and without the need for countries to give up their national currencies.",
      "The central banks of member states must then ensure that this ASEAN coin is liquid and easily exchangeable to respective national currencies.",
      "In any event, previous infrastructural, financial, and economic disparities have not prevented ASEAN from setting ambitious goals such as the realisa tion of an ASEAN Economic Community.",
      "Unintended Consequences As with any novel ideas, the prospects of unintended consequences remain.",
      "An ASEAN Coin, could, foreseeably throw the national monetary policies of ASEAN countries out of whack.",
      "Even so, adopti on could take a staggered approach where it is trialled with selected ASEAN industries before being rolled out to other sectors.",
      "Implementation could also be fraught and questions over money laundering with such a regional currency must also be confronte d.",
      "Nevertheless, the pandemic has shown in very stark terms how cookie -cutter solutions that have worked for so long, needs serious re -thinking.",
      "While it may be some way off before an ASEAN -wide digital currency becomes a reality, it is imperative that AS EAN member states start thinking about this possibility in a post -physical currency world.",
      "As various political actors around the globe advance their CBDC projects, the defining inequity of the near future may not be financial inequality but technological inequality.",
      "As such, conversations about an ASEAN currency, centered on financial inclusion with ASEAN know -how, should start now."
    ],
    "question": "5. What potential unintended consequences could arise from the adoption of an ASEAN digital currency, and how can these be mitigated?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "1. One potential unintended consequence of adopting an ASEAN digital currency could be the exclusion of unbanked populations. If the digital currency requires a bank account to participate, then those without access to banking services may be left behind, further exacerbating financial inequality. It is important to consider solutions such as allowing participation through third-party vendors or creating a dual-system that allows both digital and fiat transactions.",
      "2. Another possible consequence could be the increase in cyber attacks and risks of hacking. As digital currencies rely heavily on technology and the internet, there is a heightened risk of cybercrime. Countermeasures, such as robust cybersecurity protocols and regular audits, should be put in place to mitigate these risks and protect the integrity of the currency.",
      "3. Lastly, governments in the ASEAN member states may be tempted to use the digital currency for domestic political purposes, such as encouraging nationalism or controlling online activity. This could lead to a loss of trust in the digital currency and undermine its effectiveness. To mitigate this, clear regulations and guidelines should be set in place to ensure transparency and prevent political manipulation."

    "question": "3. What is the OECD's Inclusive Framework and what are its two pillars?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The OECD's Inclusive Framework is a grouping of countries that are committed to collaborating and cooperating on issues related to tax policy and avoiding base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). The Inclusive Framework was established in 2013 and is open to all countries, regardless of whether they are members of the OECD or not.",
      "The two pillars of the Inclusive Framework are the mandatory automatic exchange of tax information, also known as the Common Reporting Standard (CRS), and the development of minimum standards for the exchange of tax information. These two pillars are aimed at ensuring that countries have the tools they need to tackle tax avoidance and evasion, and to promote transparency and fairness in international taxation.",
      "The CRS requires countries to automatically exchange information on financial accounts held by taxpayers in different countries. This helps to ensure that taxpayers are paying tax in the country where they have economic activity, and that governments are able to ensure that they are receiving the tax revenue they are due. The development of minimum standards for the exchange of tax information provides a framework for countries to ensure that they have the necessary tools to tackle tax avoidance and evasion, and to promote transparency and fairness in international taxation.",
      "In conclusion, the Inclusive Framework and its two pillars, the CRS and the minimum standards for the exchange of tax information, are critical components of the OECD's efforts to address tax avoidance and evasion, and to promote transparency and fairness in international taxation. They provide a framework for countries to work together to tackle these issues and to ensure that taxpayers are paying tax in the country where they have economic activity."

      "Benefits and challenges of the proposed multilateral tax treaty:",
      "The proposed multilateral tax treaty has the potential to bring significant benefits to the international community in the field of taxation. One of the primary benefits of the treaty is that it would help to prevent tax evasion and avoidance by multinational corporations. This is because it would establish a transparent and standardized reporting framework, which would make it more difficult for companies to engage in aggressive tax planning. This would, in turn, lead to a more level playing field for smaller businesses that operate within the same jurisdiction. Additionally, the treaty could also help to ensure that multinationals pay their fair share of tax, which would help to reduce fiscal deficits and support public services in countries where they operate.",
      "However, there are also challenges associated with the proposed multilateral tax treaty. One of the main challenges is that it may lead to a reduction in the competitiveness of some countries. This is because it would make it more difficult for companies to use tax havens to reduce their tax liabilities. This could result in companies relocating to countries with more favorable tax regimes, which could have negative implications for the countries that host them. Additionally, there may also be concerns about the implementation and enforcement of the treaty, which could result in additional administrative costs for governments.",

      "Overall, purely online radicalisation occurred in only 13 per ce nt of cases in 2021.",
      "The second pattern that persisted in 2018 and 2021 was the role of social ties in facilitating the radicalisation process.",
      "Despite some claims that online self - radicalisation is a major threat, data actually suggested that most members of pro -IS terrorist organisations were radicalised either by or with someone they were personally familiar with.",

      "In 2021, this percentage remained high at 77 per cent.",
      "The data also showed that the most common social ties which facilitated radicalisations were the individuals\u2019 relationships with their ulamas followed by friendships and family ties.",
      "In 2018, 32 per cent of the people radicalised involved a radical ulama they were close to, and 22 per cent involved introduction to radical materials by a friend or family member who was part of or on the way to joining a pro - IS group.",

    "close_book_answer": [
      "There were two notable patterns of radicalization observed among pro-IS (Islamic State) organizations between 2018 and 2021. The first pattern was the rise in homegrown radicalization, where individuals in their home country were radicalized and recruited by IS. This was seen in countries such as France, the UK, and Belgium, where individuals who had been previously unknown to law enforcement agencies suddenly became radicalized and carried out attacks.",
      "The second pattern observed was the shift in radicalization tactics by IS. In the early years of the organization, IS focused on recruiting individuals who had already displayed signs of radicalization and were searching for a group to join. However, in the later years, IS shifted towards a more aggressive recruitment strategy, targeting individuals who had not previously expressed radical views. This shift was observed in countries such as Tunisia, where IS began to target individuals who were disenfranchised and had a history of violence.",
      "These patterns were observed during a period where IS was losing ground in Syria and Iraq, and was desperate to maintain its presence through international attacks. As a result, the organization shifted its focus from recruiting individuals who were already radicalized to targeting those who were not. This shift in tactics by IS was a matter of concern for law enforcement agencies and governments around the world, as it indicated an increase in the potential for homegrown terrorism."

    "question": "3. What are the most common starting points of offline radicalisation among pro-IS supporters?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The most common starting points of offline radicalisation among pro-IS supporters are often rooted in socio-economic and political factors. One common factor is a sense of disenfranchisement, where individuals may feel marginalized or disillusioned with their current situation, leading them to seek out radical ideologies as a means of finding a sense of purpose or belonging. Additionally, exposure to extremist propaganda online, through social media or other sources, can further contribute to the process of radicalization. This propaganda often preys on individuals who are already vulnerable or searching for answers, presenting extremist ideologies as a solution to their problems. Lastly, personal experiences of trauma, discrimination or injustice can also be a common starting point for radicalization, as individuals seek revenge or a means of redress for the wrongs they have suffered.",

      "Overall, the data showed that only 9 per cent of pro -IS radicalisations in 2018 took place exclusively online.",
      "Offline radicalisation of pro -IS supporters was also prevalent in 2021.",
      "Notably, about 60 per cent of those arrested in 2021 were radicalised through solely offline means.",
      "As in 2018, mosques and private Quranic groups were the most common starting point of an individual's radicalisation, accounting for 86 per cent of all offline radicalisation cases in 2021.",
      "A lthough the proportion of pro -IS supporters radicalised online increased from 35 per cent in 2018 to 40 per cent in 2021, many were still simultaneously involved in offline processes as well.",
      "Overall, purely online radicalisation occurred in only 13 per ce nt of cases in 2021.",
      "The second pattern that persisted in 2018 and 2021 was the role of social ties in facilitating the radicalisation process.",
      "Despite some claims that online self - radicalisation is a major threat, data actually suggested that most members of pro -IS terrorist organisations were radicalised either by or with someone they were personally familiar with.",
      "Data from the ITI Dataset foun d that 73 per cent of all pro -IS supporters who were arrested in 2018 had a social relationship with another supporter who facilitated their radicalisation process.",
      "In 2021, this percentage remained high at 77 per cent.",
      "The data also showed that the most common social ties which facilitated radicalisations were the individuals\u2019 relationships with their ulamas followed by friendships and family ties.",
      "In 2018, 32 per cent of the people radicalised involved a radical ulama they were close to, and 22 per cent involved introduction to radical materials by a friend or family member who was part of or on the way to joining a pro - IS group.",
      "In 2021, these numbers remained about the same, with 34 per cent involving radical ulamas and 28 per cent involving a friend or family member.",
      "The case of the Anshor Daulah Villa Mutiara group highlights the significance of social ties in the radicalisation of pro -IS supporters.",
      "This group, located in Makassar, South Sulawesi, was brought together by Rizaldy whose radicalisation was facilitated by Ustad Basri, his ulama while he was a member of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI).",
      "Rizaldy es tablished private Quranic recital groups and invited his siblings, their spouses, and former FPI colleagues to participate.",
      "Even tually, the group expanded to 80 people and its most infamous terrorist couples, Ulfa and Rullie along with Lukman and Dewi, went on to perpetuate, respectively, the 2019 Jolo c athedral bombing and the 2021 Makassar bombing.",
      "Looking Ahead In view of the persistent patterns of offline radicalisations involving social networks observed in 2018 and 2021, it is likely that these trends are still prevalent today.",
      "It is therefore vital for the Indonesian government to conduct two things.",
      "Firstly, it needs to collaborate with and expand the reach of civil society groups involved in the battle against extremism in offline settings.",
      "Secondly, it needs to coordinate with and support \u201cPreventing and Countering Violent Extremism (P/CVE)\u201d organisations in implementing a \u201c whole of society \u201d approach to identify and to intervene early in radicalisation processes.",
      "It is important, however, that this focus on offline radicalisation is not done at the expense of combating online radic alisation."

    "question": "5. What are the two things that the Indonesian government needs to do to address the persistent patterns of offline radicalisation involving social networks observed in 2018 and 2021?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "One of the things that the Indonesian government should do to address the persistent patterns of offline radicalization involving social networks is to increase regulation and oversight of social media platforms. This can be done by implementing stricter rules and penalties for the posting of hate speech and extremist content. Additionally, the government can work with social media companies to develop better content moderation tools and technologies to detect and remove extremist content from their platforms. This will help to limit the spread of radical ideas and prevent marginalized individuals from being exposed to harmful content.",
      "Another crucial step that the Indonesian government can take to address offline radicalization is to invest in social and economic development programs for vulnerable communities. Many of the people who are drawn to extremist ideologies come from impoverished and marginalized communities, which lack access to education, healthcare, and basic services. By providing these communities with economic opportunities and basic services, the government can help to reduce poverty and inequality, which are known to fuel extremist ideologies.",
      "Finally, the Indonesian government can work to promote interfaith dialogue and understanding. Radicalization often occurs when people from different religious or ethnic backgrounds become isolated and mistrustful of one another. By promoting dialogue and understanding, the government can help to foster a sense of unity and belonging among different communities, which can help to counteract radicalization. This can be done through public outreach programs, interfaith events, and other initiatives that bring people from different backgrounds together to share their experiences and perspectives."

The agreement has provided a platform for the ASEAN countries to work together in addressing common challenges and threats posed by natural and man-made disasters. One of the critical ways AADMER has contributed to regional cooperation in disaster response is by promoting the sharing of resources and expertise among member states. This has enabled ASEAN countries to pool their resources and capabilities to respond to disasters more effectively and efficiently. For example, during the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, ASEAN member states came together to provide assistance and relief to the affected countries.",

      "1. Emotional bonds can play a crucial role in fostering successful regional cooperation in disaster response. When individuals feel a sense of empathy and solidarity with their neighbors, they are more likely to be willing to help during a crisis and contribute to a coordinated response effort. This sense of shared identity and collective commitment can also promote trust and collaboration among different regions, leading to more effective disaster response protocols.",
      "2. In order for emotional bonds to contribute to successful regional cooperation in disaster response, it is important that they are built upon a foundation of mutual understanding and respect. This can be achieved through initiatives that promote cultural exchange and education about different regional perspectives and customs. By fostering a sense of shared values and mutual reliance, emotional bonds can become a powerful force for promoting peace and stability in disaster-prone regions.",
      "3. It is also important to recognize that emotional bonds alone may not be sufficient to ensure successful regional cooperation in disaster response. In addition to social connections, effective disaster response requires strong institutional frameworks and technical expertise. Governments and international organizations must work to strengthen these aspects of disaster response in order to support emotional bonds and facilitate more effective regional cooperation in times of crisis.",

      "Berlin\u2019s strategic culture , domestic politics and an entrenched public pacificism made raising the defence budget as difficult as developing a realistic security strategy appropriate for a country so prone to geopolitical challenges.",

      "Likewise, to reduce Germany\u2019s significant dependency on Russian energy imports (every fourth household relies on Russian gas for heating), even Green party leaders agree tha t Berlin will now likely have to postpone its exit from both coal - and nuclear - energy, and Nordstream 2 is now all but finished.",

    "question": "1. What factors contributed to Germany's decision to increase its defense budget and adopt a more strategic approach to security?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "1. The increase in Germany's defense budget and strategic approach to security can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991 diminished the political and military threat posed to Germany, leading to a relaxation of military tensions in Europe. However, this was followed by new security challenges, such as the rise of Islamic extremism and the growing instability in the Middle East.",
      "2. Secondly, Germany's commitment to its role as a global military power has also played a significant role. Since the end of World War II, Germany has steadily increased its military spending and capabilities, with the aim of becoming a more significant player in global security. This has been driven by a desire to project power and influence beyond Europe, as well as a recognition of the changing geopolitical landscape.",
      "3. Finally, Germany's growing economic power and global prominence has contributed to the decision to increase its defense budget. As the largest economy in Europe, Germany has a responsibility to contribute to the continent's security and stability. This has led to a focus on modernizing its military equipment and investing in key strategic areas, such as cybersecurity and space technology."

The pipeline, which runs from Russia to Germany, has been a source of tension between Russia and Western countries due to concerns over Russia's dominance in the natural gas market and potential use of energy as a political tool.",

This has led to concerns that the pipeline will undermine the energy security of Europe and increase its dependence on Russian gas.",
      "In conclusion, the Nordstream 2 gas pipeline plays a crucial role in the geopolitical challenges facing Germany and Europe. It poses a threat to the energy security of Europe, and could lead to a further reduction in Russia's political influence and power in the region."

    "question": "4. How might the EU's decision to finance lethal weapons and impose substantial sanctions on Russia impact the relationship between the EU and Russia?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The EU's decision to finance lethal weapons and impose substantial sanctions on Russia could have a significant impact on the already strained relationship between the two parties. Firstly, this decision could escalate tensions between the EU and Russia, leading to a breakdown in diplomatic relations. By providing lethal weapons to Ukraine, the EU is essentially supporting the Ukrainian government in its conflict with Russia. This move could be seen as a provocative act by Russia, leading to a further deterioration in their relationship.",
      "Secondly, the sanctions imposed on Russia may lead to retaliation from the Russian government. Russia has a history of retaliating against countries that impose sanctions on it, and the EU is no exception. The Russian government could impose its own sanctions on the EU, leading to economic consequences for European countries. This could also lead to a decline in trade between the EU and Russia, further damaging their relationship.",
      "Finally, the EU's decision may also have a negative impact on the citizens of both countries. The escalation of tensions between the EU and Russia could lead to increased military action, which could result in the loss of lives and displacement of people. Additionally, the economic consequences of the sanctions could lead to job losses and a decline in living standards for citizens on both sides.",
      "In conclusion, the EU's decision to finance lethal weapons and impose substantial sanctions on Russia is a risky move that could have far-reaching consequences for both parties. While the EU may see this as a necessary step to protect Ukraine and uphold international law, it could also lead to a further breakdown in"

This disparity makes it difficult for ASEAN to establish a uniform approach to cybersecurity, as countries with limited resources may struggle to implement the necessary measures.",
      "3. The complex and rapidly evolving nature of cyberspace also poses a challenge for the development of CBMs in ASEAN. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, and keeping up with the latest developments and technologies is a challenge for both governments and private sector organisations. This makes it difficult to establish effective CBMs that can adapt to the changing cybersecurity landscape."

One recommendation is for ASEAN countries to enhance cybersecurity cooperation and collaboration through the establishment of regional cybersecurity dialogues and partnerships. This will enable the sharing of cyber threat information and best practices, as well as the development of joint responses to cyber attacks.",
      "Another recommendation is for ASEAN to strengthen its cyber legal and regulatory frameworks. This involves the adoption of international standards, such as the United Nations General Assembly's (UNGA) resolution on the responsible behavior of states in cyberspace, and the harmonization of national cyber laws to ensure their consistency and effectiveness. It is also essential for ASEAN to invest in cybersecurity education and awareness programs to enhance the capacity of its citizens to protect themselves from cyber threats.",
      "Finally, the Sydney Recommendations suggest that ASEAN countries should encourage the growth of the regional cybersecurity industry by supporting research and development in the field and promoting the adoption of innovative cybersecurity solutions. This includes the establishment of cybersecurity innovation centers, which can provide a space for companies and startups to collaborate and develop new technologies to address emerging threats."

    "question": "1. What is the significance of the Bay of Bengal region in the context of the Indo-Pacific region?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The Bay of Bengal region is of significant importance in the Indo-Pacific region as it is a crucial transit area for global trade, energy supply chains, and strategic interests of major powers. The region is home to several littoral states, including India, China, and several Southeast Asian nations, which are major economic and political players in the region.",
      "The Bay of Bengal region also holds significant economic and strategic importance due to its resource-rich waters, including oil and gas reserves, fisheries, and minerals. This makes it a region of high competition among the littoral states for control over the resources, leading to territorial disputes and military buildups.",
      "Furthermore, the Bay of Bengal region is emerging as a key node in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China's massive infrastructure development plan, which extends from China's coast to Europe through the Middle East, Central Asia, and the Indian Ocean. China's increasing presence in the region through BRI has heightened concerns among India and the US, which see it as a strategic threat to their interests in the region.",
      "In conclusion, the Bay of Bengal region is a critical component of the Indo-Pacific region, not only due to its strategic location, but also due to its economic and resource significance. The region's strategic importance, coupled with China's growing presence through BRI, has made it a major flashpoint for competition and rivalry among major powers, with potentially significant implications for regional and global security."

Some countries may lack the financial and human resources needed to participate fully in BIMSTEC activities, which can limit their ability to contribute to the organization's goals and objectives.

    "question": "5. How can BIMSTEC contribute to regional integration and collaboration in the Bay of Bengal region?",

      "The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) is a regional organization that aims to promote economic, technical, and cultural cooperation among the seven member states in the Bay of Bengal region. One possible answer for the given question is:",
      "1. BIMSTEC can contribute to regional integration and collaboration in the Bay of Bengal region by promoting trade, investment, and economic cooperation among its member states. The organization can facilitate the movement of goods, services, and people across borders and help reduce trade barriers and tariffs. BIMSTEC can also promote investment in key industries such as infrastructure, manufacturing, and tourism, which can create job opportunities and boost economic growth in the region.",
      "2. Another way BIMSTEC can contribute to regional integration and collaboration is by promoting cultural and technical cooperation. The organization can promote cultural exchanges and people-to-people interactions among its member states, which can help reduce misunderstandings and promote mutual understanding. BIMSTEC can also promote technical cooperation in areas such as water resources management, disaster management, and environmental protection, which are critical for the sustainable development of the region.",
      "3. Lastly, BIMSTEC can contribute to regional integration and collaboration by creating a platform for dialogue and cooperation on regional issues such as terrorism, extremism, and transnational crimes. The organization can promote counter-terrorism efforts, anti-radicalization programs, and the exchange of information and best practices among its member states. By addressing these challenges collectively, BIMSTEC can help promote stability and security in the region, which is critical for its economic development and integration.",
      "Overall, BIMSTEC has the potential to contribute significantly to regional integration and collaboration in the Bay of Bengal region. However, success will depend on the level of commitment and cooperation among its member states, and the ability to overcome challenges such as political differences, instability, and lack of resources."

      "COMMENTARY AT THE historic Bretton Woods Conf erence of 1944, to address the economic instability of the 1930s, a set of rules -based international economic institutions (IEIs) that are collectively referred to as the global economic architecture (GEA) was established under the leadership of the United States.",
      "This architecture comprised the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for macroeconomic and monetary stability; the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \u2013 the predecessor of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to promote trade openness; and the World Bank to provide development finance for poverty reduction.",
      "Although it had several critical flaws, the Bretton Woods GEA worked well for more than 60 years arguably until the eruption of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC).",
      "It ushered in the golden age of globalisation and brought about economic growth and prosperity all over the world.",
      "Gradualist Reform & the Changed Context Reforms of this architecture have been implemented in an incremental and gradual manner.",
      "These comprise (i) the establishment of the G7 in 1975 and its upgradation to the G20 summit in the aftermath of the GFC; (ii) a shift to a floating system of exchange rates in 1973 after the collapse of the pegged rates of the Bretton Woods monetary arrangement; (iii) the establishment of the Financial Stability Forum and its upgrading to the Financial Stability Board after the GFC; and (iv) the transitioning from GATT to the WTO in 1995.",
      "More recently, the context in which the global IEIs operate has changed in two important ways.",
      "First, the unipolar world with the US as the sole superpower has become multi -polar where economic and political power has shifted to some extent to the dynamic emerging markets, particularly those in Asia such as China and India.",
      "These emerging markets have sought a greater voice in the operation of the IEIs.",
      "But the major Western shareholders remain antipathetic to the required changes in rules and policies.",
      "Second, during the Bretton Woods era, policymakers were wary of uncontrolled finance and had imposed restri ctions on cross -border flows of capital.",
      "In the 1990s, under the so -called Washington Consensus, countries around the world deregulated their capital accounts.",
      "Over time, this has produced highly integrated global financial markets and capital flows that h ave dwarfed the regulatory capacity and operations of IEIs.",
      "With financial globalisation, a new type of crisis associated with large capital inflows and their sudden reversals have become more frequent occurring every 10 to 12 years.",
      "In addition to insta bility, financial globalisation has also led to intra - and inter - country income inequality.",
      "Calls for Big Bang Reforms: Bretton Woods 2.",
      "0? Calls have, therefore, been made for a comprehensive reform of the Bretton Woods GEA.",
      "In the post -GFC period, a num ber of academics and politicians had called for a New Bretton Woods (NBW), a wider and more comprehensive reform of the GEA.",
      "These had included Professor Joseph Stiglitz and politicians like Nicholas Sarkozy and Gordon Brown.",
      "The then central bank govern or of China, Zhou Xiaochuan, had also made a pitch for a new international reserve asset to replace the US dollar and its hegemony.",
      "The calls for a NBW fizzled out at the interregnum stage because the recovery from the GFC turned out to be faster than ex pected and the world experienced a Great Recession rather than the originally expected repeat of the Great Depression of the 1930s.",
      "This led to complacency and dilution of reform proposals.",
      "Similar calls for comprehensive reforms of the Bretton Wood GEA h ave been made in the wake of the COVID -19 pandemic which has led to the worst global economic downturn since the Great Depression.",
      "According to the latest IMF estimate, world output shrank by 3.",
      "1% in 2020 as compared to 0.",
      "1% in 2009.",
      "Gallaghar and Kozul -Wright have noted that inequality, indebtedness, and insufficient productive investments have become the new normal and called for a renewed multilateral order.",
      "Tinkering with existing rules cannot provide the way out.",
      "Vines argues that the world now faces two choices (i) revisit the direction of t he mid - 1940s when ruled based GEA were established or (ii) return to the path of the 1930s when weak cooperation led to an economic depression and eventually a world war.",
      "He adds that the crises of this century proves that there is an urgent need for funda mental reform by learning lessons from history.",
      "What lessons can be learned from COVID -19 and the invasion of Ukraine? Will they be game -changing events and lead to the overhaul of the global economic architecture? If so, how? Going Forward Looking for ward, will the calls for Big Bang reform of the Bretton Woods GEA be realised any time soon? Probably, not.",
      "This is because with the recent rise in nationalism and populism worldwide and the on -going conflict between the US and China and the Russia -Ukraine War, the political will to spur global cooperation and coordination is weak and risk of yet another East -West divide reminiscent of the Cold War era world order is genuine.",
      "Under former President Trump, the US had embraced the \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy and protectionism pivoting away from multilateralism of the past to \u201cunilateralism\u201d and \u201cbilateralism\u201d.",
      "President Biden is supportive of multilateralism but still many of the tariffs that were imposed on about 20% of total imports of the US remain.",
      "Similarl y, European countries had initiated policy actions to protect their economies especially from rising inflows of migrant workers from the Middle East.",
      "Countries around the world also retaliated and became more inward -looking.",

    "close_book_answer": [
      "The Bretton Woods Conference was a gathering of international economists and diplomats held in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, United States, from July 1 to July 22, 1944. The purpose of the conference was to design a new international economic and monetary system that would replace the gold standard, which had collapsed during World War II, and to establish institutions that would promote economic cooperation and stability among nations.",
      "As a result of the conference, two institutions were established: the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (also known as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development or the IBRD). The IMF was created to oversee the international monetary system and to facilitate the balanced growth of international trade. The World Bank, on the other hand, was established to provide financing for reconstruction and development in countries devastated by the war.",
      "The Bretton Woods Conference is also significant because it led to the creation of the U.S. dollar as the world's primary reserve currency. At the conference, it was agreed that the U.S. dollar would be convertible to gold at a fixed rate of $35 per ounce, and that other currencies would be pegged to the dollar. This system of fixed exchange rates was known as the Bretton Woods System and it lasted until 1971, when the U.S. government suspended the convertibility of the dollar to gold.",
      "In summary, the Bretton Woods Conference was a pivotal event in the history of international economics and global governance,"

    "question": "2. What were the key flaws of the Bretton Woods GEA and how did it contribute to the Global Financial Crisis?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The Bretton Woods GEA, established in 1944, aimed to rebuild the international monetary system after World War II. However, the agreement had several key flaws that ultimately contributed to the Global Financial Crisis in 2008.",
      "Firstly, the GEA established the US dollar as the sole reserve currency, making it the sole authority for exchange rates. This made the US dollar the primary global currency, and countries were required to hold dollars in reserve. However, the US government's ability to print money and run large deficits contributed to the over-valuation of the dollar, leading to imbalances in the global economy.",
      "Secondly, the GEA failed to create a mechanism for adjusting exchange rates, leading to fixed exchange rates among countries. This created problems when countries experienced imbalances in their economies, such as when they faced high inflation or low growth. As a result, the exchange rates were often forced to stay within a narrow range, leading to speculative attacks on the currency.",
      "Finally, the GEA did not establish any regulatory mechanism to monitor the international financial system. This allowed banks to take on too much risk and engage in unregulated activities, such as derivatives trading, which contributed to the Global Financial Crisis.",
      "In conclusion, the Bretton Woods GEA's flaws, including the over-valuation of the US dollar, lack of exchange rate flexibility, and absence of regulation, ultimately contributed to the Global Financial Crisis."

    "question": "4. How has the shift from a fixed to a floating exchange rate system impacted the global economy?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The transition from a fixed to a floating exchange rate system has had significant implications on the global economy.",
      "Firstly, the floating exchange rate system has increased the volatility and uncertainty of the global financial markets. With exchange rates determined by market forces rather than government intervention, fluctuations in currency values can lead to sudden changes in trade patterns and investment flows. This has made it more difficult for businesses and governments to plan and predict future economic developments.",
      "Secondly, the floating exchange rate system has allowed for greater flexibility in the management of exchange rates and has allowed countries to respond more effectively to changing economic conditions. This has enabled countries to adopt monetary and fiscal policies that are better suited to their specific circumstances, leading to increased economic stability and growth in some cases.",
      "Finally, the shift to a floating exchange rate system has also increased the interconnectedness of global financial markets. As exchange rates are now determined by market forces, changes in one country's exchange rate can have ripple effects across the global economy, leading to greater financial instability and the potential for contagion in times of crisis.",
      "In conclusion, the shift from a fixed to a floating exchange rate system has had significant implications on the global economy, leading to increased volatility and uncertainty in financial markets, increased flexibility in exchange rate management, and increased interconnectedness of global financial markets."

    "question": "5. What are the two important changes in the context in which the global IEIs operate and how have they affected the architecture?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The context in which global IEIs (International English Instruction) operate has undergone two important changes in recent years. The first change is the rise of English as a global language, which has made it much more widely spoken and understood around the world. This has resulted in English instruction becoming a key aspect of education in many countries, as it is often seen as a necessary tool for communication and economic success.",
      "The second important change in the context of IEIs is the growing demand for English instruction in Asia, particularly in China and India. These countries have rapidly expanding economies and are becoming increasingly influential on the global stage. As a result, many parents in these countries are seeking to give their children a competitive edge by enrolling them in English-language schools and programs. This has led to a boom in the IEI industry, with many schools and institutions seeking to cater to this growing demand.",
      "These changes have had a significant impact on the architecture of IEIs, particularly in terms of how they are delivered and what types of programs are offered. For example, the popularity of online learning and distance education has increased, as these formats can be more easily adapted to the needs of students in different locations. Additionally, there has been an increased focus on preparing students for standardized English-language tests such as TOEFL and IELTS, as these exams are often seen as key to gaining admission to universities in English-speaking countries. Overall, the changing context in which IEIs operate has led to a more diverse and flexible landscape of English-language instruction, with programs and services adapted to meet the needs of students and institutions in different regions of the world."

      "COMMENTARY CHINA\u2019S CONSENT, on 1 May 2019, to designate Pakist ani national, Masood Azhar, as a terrorist, under the relevant United Nations n orms, fulfils a long-standing Indian demand.",
      "India intensified its campaign for such UN action after Azhar\u2019s outfit owned responsibility for the internationally-condemned te rrorist attack on Indian security personnel on 14 February.",
      "China\u2019s latest decision to join the dominant view o n this issue at a UN panel is significant.",
      "Despite Pakistan being China\u2019s \u201call-we ather strategic cooperative partner\u201d since 2015, the Chinese have signalled the relative importance of neighbouring India in their expanding foreign policy calculus.",
      "This is evident from the recent Chinese attitude towards India although it has not joined C hina\u2019s worldwide Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).",
      "Advocacy of Closer Sino-Indian Ties The BRI is a collective name for the multi-modal co nnectivity projects that radiate from China across continents and cover diverse spectra o f economic activities.",
      "Ahead of the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Co operation (BRF) in Beijing on 26- 27 April 2019, China knew India would not attend th e summit.",
      "It was no secret that India felt that its BRI concerns were being disrega rded by China.",
      "However, prior to the Second BRF, Chinese Ambassado r to India, Luo Zhaohui, emphasised the \u201cvision\u201d of \u201cachieving [Sino-Indian] synergy on the Belt and Road Initiative\u201d.",
      "Luo\u2019s call for creating BRI \u201csynergy\u201d ranked fourth in his priorities for improving Beijing\u2019s often-chequered relations with Delhi.",
      "Topping Luo\u2019s \u201cvision\u201d was the need for \u201cnegotiating and signing China-India T reaty of Good Neighbourliness and Friendly Cooperation\u201d.",
      "He suggested bilateral \u201cfree trade agreements\u201d and consultations to reap \u201cearly harvests\u201d even while patiently settling the Sino-In dian boundary dispute.",
      "Two factors explain Luo\u2019s advocacy.",
      "Masking Modi\u2019s Absence at BRF Firstly, Chinese President Xi Jinping chaired the S econd BRF precisely one year after he held an unprecedented \u201cinformal summit\u201d with Ind ian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Wuhan, China.",
      "For Xi, the Wuhan summit was \u201ca ne w starting point\u201d in Sino-Indian diplomacy.",
      "Modi, too, said India and China crossed a new \u201cmile stone\u201d in bilateral diplomacy during the Wuhan summit.",
      "So, new ideas like Luo\u2019s may actu ally help in masking Modi\u2019s absence at Xi\u2019s latest BRF Roundtable on 27 April 2 019.",
      "Secondly, there is a nuanced explanation for Luo\u2019s advocacy.",
      "India\u2019s opposition to the BRI initially became known when Modi, despite being invited by Xi, stayed away from the First BRF summit in Beijing in May 2017.",
      "India\u2019 s opposition was, and continues to be, driven by two strands of reason.",
      "The first reason is that a key BRI project \u2013 the Ch ina-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) \u2013 passes through a disputed area that Islama bad controls and India claims as its legitimate sovereign territory.",
      "Contrary to the BRF\u2019s norm of \u201cextensive consultation\u201d for project finalisation, India feels , its sensitivities were \u201cignored\u201d by China before it finalised the CPEC with Pakistan.",
      "A New Message from BRF The second reason for India\u2019s opposition to the BRI is somewhat subtle.",
      "India hints that the BRI projects are not \u201cbased on universally recognised international norms\u201d.",
      "Apparently in response to this criticism, the Secon d BRF affirmed as follows on 27 April 2019: \u201cAll states are equal partners for coop eration that respects openness, transparency, inclusiveness and level playing field.",
      "We encourage.",
      "a greater role of development finance in line with.",
      "the agreed principles by the UNGA [United Nations General Assembly] on debt sustainability\u201d.",
      "The BRF\u2019s affirmation of faith in the UN norms of \u201c debt sustainability\u201d is noteworthy.",
      "\u201cDebts\u201d owed to Beijing and/or Chinese entities by their partners were becoming a BRI controversy in some quarters.",
      "Chinese diplomats hav e even viewed India as a key campaigner against China\u2019s alleged \u201cdebt trap diplo macy\u201d towards BRI partners.",
      "\u201cDebt sustainability\u201d is, therefore, the latest BRF messa ge that India cannot easily ignore any longer.",
      "In this milieu, Luo\u2019s proposals for updating Sino-I ndian diplomacy are essentially aspirational.",
      "Why? A \u201cfriendship treaty\u201d is a creat ive idea whose time is yet to come.",
      "A \u201cfree trade agreement\u201d is conceivable.",
      "However, C hina and India may first have to strike a harmonious chord during the ongoing negoti ations for Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).",
      "ASEAN is piloting the RCEP parleys.",
      "Not really new is the idea of seeking \u201cearly harves ts\u201d while negotiating a settlement of the Sino-Indian boundary dispute.",
      "Moreover, the dis pute is seen by both sides as a comprehensive strategic issue that cannot be easily compartmentalised.",
      "As for BRI \u201csynergy\u201d, India still sees the Chinese initiative as a bridge too far in bilateral relations.",
      "An Emerging Sino-Indian Ambience Nonetheless, some indices of India\u2019s emergence as a potential powerhouse are of interest to global China.",
      "These are India\u2019s economi c \u2018rise\u2019, nuclear arsenal, growing \u2018harmony\u2019 with America, diplomatic proximity to Rus sia, and scientific \u2018military\u2019 prowess in the Outer Space.",
      "In the Outer Space, hum anity\u2019s future frontier, India is emerging as an early pioneer behind the United Stat es, Russia and China.",
      "However, there is nothing to suggest a fanciful com ing collapse of Sino-Pakistani \u201ciron friendship\u201d or a reversal of China\u2019s latest pledge of support for Pakistan\u2019s \u201cnational dignity\u201d.",
      "The new dynamic in Sino-Indian diplomacy, therefore, is China\u2019s review of India, as is explicit in Luo\u2019s proposals.",
      "Refining China\u2019s review of India after the Second B RF, Luo disclosed, on 6 May 2019, that \u201cwe are [still] expecting India to be part of the BRI\u201d.",
      "In his view, participation in the BRI would be \u201cthe key\u201d to a \u201csolution\u201d of India\u2019s c oncerns over its huge trade deficit with China.",
      "China\u2019s messaging to the next Indian go vernment, expected to be formed later this month, cannot, therefore, be missed."

    "question": "4. What are some of the reasons behind China's advocacy for closer Sino-Indian ties?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "China's advocacy for closer Sino-Indian ties can be attributed to several reasons. Firstly, China sees India as a potential strategic partner in the region and views strengthened economic and diplomatic ties as a way to counterbalance the growing influence of the United States and its allies in the region. China sees India as a major power in South Asia, and closer ties with India can help China expand its economic and political influence in the region. Additionally, China sees India as a key market for its goods and services, and stronger economic ties can help China promote its economic growth and development.",
      "Secondly, China's advocacy for closer ties with India is also driven by Beijing's desire to reduce the trust deficit between the two countries. China and India have a long history of conflict and mistrust, particularly over border disputes and regional security issues. However, Beijing sees improved ties with India as a way to address these issues and build a more cooperative and collaborative relationship.",
      "Finally, China's advocacy for closer ties with India is also driven by Beijing's desire to diversify its exports and reduce its dependence on the United States and other Western countries. China sees India as a potential market for its goods and services, particularly in sectors such as infrastructure, energy, and technology. Strengthened economic ties with India can help China expand its global footprint and reduce its dependence on the US and its allies."

India views China's growing relationship with Pakistan as a direct result of its own global ambitions, which it sees as a threat to its own interests.

      "It was also noted that Abduramil\u2019s wife, Reda Mohamad Mahmud Mohamad, was the suicide bomber at a military checkpoint on 8 September 2019 which faile d to cause any fatalities.",

      "Two theories to the localisation of suicide terrori sm in the Philippines have been forwarded: the active recruitment of foreign suicide bombers and the local adoption of the tactic.",
      "Currently, the former assessment has be en more proven as locals continue to resist the adoption of suicide bombing, going by the overwhelming foreign profile of suicide bombers in the country thus far.",
      "To date, there are five suicide bombing attempts/at tacks in the Philippines starting from the unintended Basilan Vehicle-Borne Improvise d Explosive Device (VBIED) attack on 31 December 2018 which killed 10 and wounded 7.",

      "Moreover, the five suicide bombing attacks and atte mpts demonstrated that the adoption of this tactic is contained within the Sul u region; four attacks were conducted on Jolo island.",

      "In contrast, recent attacks launched by the Maguidanao-based Turaife-led factio n of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) still favour remotely deton ated bombs.",
      "Trajectory of Suicide Bombings We can expect more attempts to introduce suicide bo mbings along the Sulu Archipelago.",

    "close_book_answer": [
      "The trend of suicide bombings in the Philippines has increased in recent years, particularly in the southern region of Mindanao. The bombings have mostly been carried out by Islamic extremist groups, including the Islamic State-linked Maute group and Abu Sayyaf. The bombings are often targeted at military and government installations, as well as public spaces such as markets and churches.",
      "The localization of suicide bombings in the Philippines can be attributed to the long-standing conflict between the government and Muslim groups in Mindanao. The conflict has resulted in a range of political and social grievances, which have been exploited by extremist groups to recruit and radicalize individuals. The ongoing conflict has also led to a breakdown in law and order, making it easier for extremist groups to carry out attacks.",
      "Counterterrorism efforts by the Philippine government, including the deployment of troops and the use of force, have had some success in reducing the number of suicide attacks. However, the underlying political and social issues that fuel extremism have not been addressed, and the threat of suicide bombings remains. It is important for the government to address the root causes of extremism and work towards a political solution to the conflict in Mindanao in order to effectively address the trend of suicide bombings in the Philippines."

      "Furthermore, the attack also highlights the persistent grievances and socio-economic issues that fuel the rise of extremism in the region. Indanan, Sulu is a predominantly Muslim area that has been historically marginalized by the government. These grievances, coupled with the entrenched poverty in the region, provide a fertile ground for extremist groups like IS to recruit and radicalize vulnerable individuals. Thus, addressing these underlying issues is crucial in countering the broader trend of suicide bombings in the Philippines."

      "Two suicide vests loaded with explosives, detonators, a loaded pistol, and a grenade were seized from the dead attackers.",
      "This suggests that only two of the three perpetrators we re prepared to be suicide bombers, and a question mark remains as to whether the sole Filipino was one of the two.",
      "The Egyptians went by the aliases of Abduramil and Yusop.",
      "It was also noted that Abduramil\u2019s wife, Reda Mohamad Mahmud Mohamad, was the suicide bomber at a military checkpoint on 8 September 2019 which faile d to cause any fatalities.",
      "This attack came shortly after the death of Abu Bakr al- Baghdadi, the self-declared caliph of the self-proclaimed Islamic State (IS), on 31 Oc tober 2019.",
      "Trend of Suicide Bombings Al-Baghdadi\u2019s symbolic death by suicide bombing ser ves as propaganda of the deed , potentially encouraging sympathisers to \u201cmartyr\u201d th emselves as he did.",
      "Coupled with the failing \u201ccaliphate\u201d in Syria after IS lost its final stronghold in Syria on 23 March 2019, it is assessed that foreign fighters are expe cted to relocate into another conflict theatre, such as the Philippines.",
      "Two theories to the localisation of suicide terrori sm in the Philippines have been forwarded: the active recruitment of foreign suicide bombers and the local adoption of the tactic.",
      "Currently, the former assessment has be en more proven as locals continue to resist the adoption of suicide bombing, going by the overwhelming foreign profile of suicide bombers in the country thus far.",
      "To date, there are five suicide bombing attempts/at tacks in the Philippines starting from the unintended Basilan Vehicle-Borne Improvise d Explosive Device (VBIED) attack on 31 December 2018 which killed 10 and wounded 7.",
      "This was a serendipitous moment for Hajan Sawadjaan \u2013 leader of IS Sulu and mooted emir of IS Philippines \u2013 as he recruited two members of the Indonesia-based Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) shortly after for a suicide attack which killed 22 and wounded more than 100 at the Our Lady of Mount Carmel Cathedral.",
      "Based on those involved in suicide attacks in the c ountry, it appears that suicide bombings still heavily rely on foreign terrorist fi ghters.",
      "Today, while there have been eight individuals who conducted or attempted suicid e bombings in the Philippines, only one Filipino was identified as a suicide attacker.",
      "The culture of upholding the honour of the warrior \u2013 to die during fighting \u2013 among ind igenous Moro tribes in Mindanao may have prevailed thus far to resist the perceived glory of suicide \u201cmartyrdom\u201d.",
      "Moreover, the five suicide bombing attacks and atte mpts demonstrated that the adoption of this tactic is contained within the Sul u region; four attacks were conducted on Jolo island.",
      "These tactics are only actively pur sued by IS Sulu which operates in the Sulu archipelago; not within mainland Mindanao.",
      "In contrast, recent attacks launched by the Maguidanao-based Turaife-led factio n of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) still favour remotely deton ated bombs.",
      "Trajectory of Suicide Bombings We can expect more attempts to introduce suicide bo mbings along the Sulu Archipelago.",
      "However, if local resistance to the ad option of suicide bombings persists, IS Sulu may step up the recruitment of foreign mili tants into Mindanao if it intends to make suicide bombings a staple in their arsenal.",
      "Th is would allow them to dispense high casualty attacks through foreign suicide bombe rs while maintaining their trained local fighting force to defend their territorial sa nctuaries.",
      "The Sulu route is one of many foreign militants use to travel into Mindanao.",
      "It is preferred as smuggling through that route is relati vely not difficult.",
      "The porous border and troubled waters between Malaysian East Sabah an d the Philippines\u2019 Sulu islets create opportunities for human smuggling into Minda nao.",
      "Hence, IS Sulu\u2019s mere presence in that region differentiates them from th e other militant groups in Southeast Asia as they are able to actively smuggle foreign m ilitants.",
      "This was observed when Indonesian militants Rullie Rian Zeke and Ulfah Handayani Saleh who conducted the Jolo Church suicide attack, were smuggled through East Sabah by IS Sulu.",
      "This route is also used by non-regional foreign fighters who see Malaysia as a transit between the Middle East and S outhern Philippines.",
      "Coupled with the potential relocation of foreign fi ghters from Syria after IS lost its territory and leader, the IS East Asia Wilayat (ie.",
      "Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Myanmar, and Japan) could beco me one of the recipients of fighters from Syria.",
      "Bids to recruit deportees who attempted to fight in Syria and returnees would pose a serious threat to the securi ty of the Sulu archipelago.",
      "Sharing of Intelligence Given the trend, it is critical that the Philippine s government adopt a comprehensive set of policies to harden its borders.",
      "This include s intelligence sharing mechanisms which leverages on transnational arrangements to de ny entrance of foreign fighters.",
      "Proposals to expand the Trilateral Cooperative Arra ngement (TCA) \u2013 joint patrols between the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia at the Sulu-Celebes Seas \u2013 to improve force coordination and intelligence sharing should be considered.",

The first theory suggests that the presence of a weak central government and the existence of local armed groups, such as the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), have created a vacuum of authority that has been filled by these groups. This has allowed them to establish their own rule of law and provide services to the local population, which has increased their popularity and recruitment efforts.

    "question": "4. How do missiles pose a different threat to nuclear facilities compared to aircraft crashes?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "Missiles pose a different threat to nuclear facilities compared to aircraft crashes because missiles are designed for specific attacks on such facilities. Unlike aircraft crashes, which can be a result of mechanical failure or human error, missiles are deliberately launched with the sole purpose of causing destruction to the target. Missiles come in various types, each with specific characteristics that make them more effective in damaging nuclear facilities. For instance, ballistic missiles are designed to travel at high velocities and altitudes, making them difficult to intercept. Other types of missiles such as cruise missiles are specifically designed to fly at low altitudes, making them harder to detect, and they can be equipped with warheads that can penetrate hardened structures.",
      "Moreover, missiles can be equipped with sophisticated guidance systems that enable them to accurately target their intended target, even if the structure is heavily fortified. This makes it challenging to defend against missile attacks as they can easily bypass conventional defense mechanisms. Additionally, the threat of missile attacks is not limited to a specific location, and can come from any direction, increasing the difficulty of detecting and intercepting them.",
      "The impact of a missile attack on a nuclear facility can also be catastrophic. The heat generation and blast effects from the detonation of the warhead can cause a nuclear fusion reaction, leading to a meltdown of the reactor and a release of radioactive materials. This can have far-reaching consequences on the environment and public health. Therefore, adequate security measures should be put in place to detect and intercept missile attacks before they cause significant damage. It is essential to understand the unique threat that missiles pose and to take the necessary steps to protect nuclear facilities from such attacks."

    "question": "5. What are the challenges and benefits of building nuclear reactors underground?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "1. One of the primary challenges of building nuclear reactors underground is the immense cost associated with the construction process. Excavating and constructing a deep underground structure requires advanced engineering techniques and specialized equipment, which can lead to higher costs compared to traditional above-ground reactors.",
      "2. Another challenge of building nuclear reactors underground is the potential environmental impact. The excavation process can disrupt natural ecosystems and cause habitat destruction, and the disposal of nuclear waste is a long-term concern that requires careful consideration and management.",
      "3. The benefits of building nuclear reactors underground include increased safety and security. The location of underground reactors provides a natural barrier against extreme weather events and aircraft impact, reducing the risk of damage and radioactive releases. Additionally, the subterranean location makes it more difficult for terrorists or other malicious actors to access and target the reactor."

    "question": "3. What is the WPS Regional Plan of Action (RPA) in ASEAN, and how does it address women's role in conflict prevention and peacebuilding?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "The WPS Regional Plan of Action (RPA) in ASEAN is a framework for promoting women's participation in conflict prevention and peacebuilding in Southeast Asia. The RPA was adopted in 2016 by the ASEAN member states and is aimed at promoting gender equality, women's empowerment, and human rights in the region.",
      "To address women's role in conflict prevention and peacebuilding, the RPA emphasizes the need for increased representation of women in decision-making processes related to peace and security. The plan calls for women to be involved in initiatives aimed at strengthening the rule of law, promoting human rights, and preventing violence against women and girls.",
      "The RPA also emphasizes the need for the integration of a gender perspective in all aspects of peace and security processes. This means that initiatives aimed at addressing conflict and promoting peace must take into account the specific needs and experiences of women and girls. Additionally, the plan calls for the creation of platforms for women to participate in peace negotiations and post-conflict reconstruction.",
      "Overall, the WPS Regional Plan of Action in ASEAN is an important step towards promoting gender equality and women's empowerment in conflict prevention and peacebuilding in the region. The plan emphasizes the need for increased representation of women in decision-making processes, the integration of a gender perspective in all aspects of peace and security, and the creation of platforms for women to participate in peace and post-conflict reconstruction processes.",
      "Critique:",
      "While the WPS Regional Plan of Action in ASEAN is a positive step towards promoting women's participation in conflict prevention and peacebuilding, there are still challenges to its implementation. One of the key challenges is the limited allocation of resources for the implementation of the plan. A lack of funding may hinder the effective implementation of the RPA, making it difficult to achieve the plan's objectives.",
      "Another challenge is the limited political will of ASEAN member states to fully implement the plan. Some member states may not prioritize women's empowerment and gender equality in their peace and security policies, making it difficult to achieve the objectives of the RPA.",
      "Finally, there is a need for more inclusive and diverse representation of women in decision-making processes related to peace and security. The RPA calls for the increased representation of women in these processes, but there is a need to ensure that women from diverse backgrounds, including those from marginalized communities, are included in these processes."

    "question": "4. How can the integration of gender analysis into climate security policies help to address social fractures and discrimination, and what opportunities exist for innovative adaptation and mitigation strategies?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "Climate change is not only a scientific issue but a socio-economic issue as well. It has a significant impact on social and gender relations, livelihoods, economic development, and political stability (IPCC, 2014). Women are often disproportionately affected by climate change and this has implications for their rights, freedoms, and opportunities. Many studies have shown that women are more vulnerable to climate change because of their limited access to resources, and their social and political marginalization in many societies across the world (Chambwera, 2010). The integration of gender analysis into climate security policies can help to address social fractures and discrimination by ensuring that the needs of women are incorporated into policy making, and by promoting gender equity and equality.",
      "Incorporating gender analysis into climate security policies can help to identify gender-specific impacts and vulnerabilities, as well as gender-sensitive mitigation and adaptation strategies. This can contribute to strengthening the voice and participation of women in decision-making processes and reducing their vulnerability to climate change and its impacts (Narrod, 2009). To achieve this, policymakers must ensure that data collection is gender-sensitive and that the data collected is used to inform policy decisions. In addition, policymakers should promote women's leadership in climate action and decision-making processes.",
      "There are many opportunities for innovative adaptation and mitigation strategies that can help to address social fractures and discrimination. For instance, promoting the use of renewable energy can provide opportunities for women to participate in the energy sector and contribute to a more sustainable energy system. In addition, investing in climate-resilient infrastructure can provide opportunities for women to participate in the construction sector and promote gender equity in the labor market.",
      "In conclusion, the integration of gender analysis into climate security policies can help to address social fractures and discrimination by ensuring that the needs of women are incorporated into policy making, and by promoting gender equity and equality. This can contribute to strengthening the voice and participation of women in decision-making processes and reducing their vulnerability to climate change and its impacts. Policymakers should take advantage of the opportunities that exist for innovative adaptation and mitigation strategies to promote gender equity and reduce the impact of climate change on women and their communities.",

      "COMMENTARY IT IS futile to debate whether Russian President Vladimir Putin had anticipated the determination and unity of Europe or was surprised by it.",
      "But as a matter of fact, the European Union (EU) and its member states are currently untying several \u201cGordian Knots\u201d at once.",
      "Take Germany as an example: Russian aggression has achieved what decades of US diplomacy could not: Berlin is finally realising that Germany must take care of its own, and by extension European, security.",
      "For decades, Germany\u2019s European neighbours, from France to Poland, as well as successive US administrations have tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to put an end to German free -riding on the NA TO and US security umbrella.",
      "Berlin had long been lacking to both equip its armed forces, the Bundeswehr, adequately and to think strategically about the defence of and challenges for Germany and Europe.",
      "The Historic German Volte -face Despite being the second largest NATO economy, hitherto, it was hopeless to expect Germany to meet its NATO defence budget obligations of 2% of GDP.",
      "Berlin\u2019s strategic culture , domestic politics and an entrenched public pacificism made raising the defence budget as difficult as developing a realistic security strategy appropriate for a country so prone to geopolitical challenges.",
      "Likewise, the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with Moscow was long a \u201choly cow\u201d of Berlin\u2019s diplomacy, preventing both the export of arms to Ukraine as wel l as unambiguously joining its NATO allies in hard -balancing Russian influence.",
      "For example, the much - discussed gas pipeline Nordstream 2 was, despite its obvious geo -strategic nature, long described as a \u201ccommercial project\u201d by successive German governments.",
      "In a series of dramatic moves within just a few days, Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced a historic volte -face that seemed to take even members of his own government by surprise.",
      "Upending decades -old fundamental principles of German foreign and security policy, Berlin is now delivering lethal weapons to Ukraine, announced a one -off tripling of th e defence budget as well as the intent to henceforth meet NATO\u2019s spending target.",
      "Likewise, to reduce Germany\u2019s significant dependency on Russian energy imports (every fourth household relies on Russian gas for heating), even Green party leaders agree tha t Berlin will now likely have to postpone its exit from both coal - and nuclear - energy, and Nordstream 2 is now all but finished.",
      "New EU Unity The President of the European Commission announced a series of measures that denoted a similarly remarkable shif t in EU Common Security and Defence Policy.",
      "Most astonishing for an organisation that self -identifies as a \u201cnormative actor\u201d, the EU will now for the first time finance lethal weapons.",
      "To that end, \u20ac450 million will go towards Ukrainian armament \u2013 a countr y that is not even a member.",
      "Beyond defence, member states demonstrated unusual unity in agreeing to substantial sanctions against Russia, including the long -resisted removal of Russia\u2019s leading banks from SWIFT.",
      "Not only will this come at significant cos ts for European economies themselves, but this agreement also bridges the traditionally significant divergence in European perspectives on economic and diplomatic relations with Moscow.",
      "No less remarkable, only six years after the so -called refugee crisi s brought the EU close to breaking point, even those member states that long resisted EU -wide refugee distribution, indeed were opposed to receiving any migrants at all, are now welcoming Ukrainian refugees with open arms.",
      "Never Waste A Crisis: Europe\u2019s Moment of Truth \u201cEurope will be forged in crisis\u201d, Jean Monnet, one of the EU\u2019s founding fathers, famously asserted.",
      "Indeed, there seems to be nothing quite like a geopolitical crisis to remind member states of the mutual security imperative of r egional integration, to galvanise and unify Europe.",
      "Indeed even Boris Johnson shows a renewed interests in cooperation with the EU.",
      "This momentum should not be squandered.",
      "In the medium -term, there might be a welcomed spill -over effect, possibly solving one of Europe\u2019s most intractable problems: creating a functioning migration regime.",
      "If the rest of the EU shows now this forthcoming solidarity with its Eastern member states that these states lacked during the 2015 refugee crisis, Europe might once again find the cooperative spirit to progress with deeper integration and policy reform, strengthening Europe\u2019s collective capacity.",
      "Similarly, substantial German investment in defence can significantly enhance Europe\u2019s defence capacity and work towards Europe\u2019 s ability to implement own strategic objectives.",
      "Mindful that a shortage of money was never the Bundeswehr\u2019s primary problem, greater defence spending must be accompanied by structural reforms and strategic embedding of German capabilities in a European fr amework.",
      "A Re -energised Europe? Lastly, part of the truth about Europe\u2019s new unity is the fact that for the first time in decades, Washington very closely cooperated with both NATO allies and the EU institutions on a collective response to a security cri sis.",
      "This cooperative spirit is, however, highly dependent on personalities rather than permanent structural change of US foreign policy.",
      "It is indeed likely that a second Trump administration had reacted very differently, side -lining rather than galvanis ing European cooperation, which would likely have led to political inertia rather than resolve in Europe.",
      "It is time to seriously consider advancing Europe\u2019s \u201cstrategic autonomy\u201d.",
      "This does not mean competition with NATO.",
      "Rather, strategic autonomy should be a European capacity to determine own strategic interests with the means to achieve them \u2013 complementary with but independent from NATO.",
      "Putin has unwittingly shaken Europe out of complacency.",
      "The previously unimaginable is suddenly reality, and the E U is already stronger and more effective and attractive than before Putin\u2019s war against Ukraine.",
      "A second \u201cBrexit -like\u201d scenario seems unlikely now, and if there is only one good thing that may come out of this tragedy, it might be a re -energised Europe."

    "question": "1. What factors contributed to Germany's decision to increase its defense budget and adopt a more strategic approach to security?",
    "close_book_answer": [
      "One factor that contributed to Germany's decision to increase its defense budget and adopt a more strategic approach to security is the growing uncertainty and instability in the global security environment. The emergence of new security challenges, such as the rise of China and Russia, has led Germany to reassess its approach to security and invest more in its defense capabilities.",
      "Another factor that contributed to Germany's decision is the increasing demand for collective defense among NATO allies. Germany, as one of the largest economies in Europe and a key NATO member, has a responsibility to contribute to the alliance's collective defense. Increasing its defense budget and adopting a more strategic approach to security is a way for Germany to fulfill this responsibility and ensure the security of the alliance as a whole.",
      "Lastly, the changing domestic political landscape in Germany has also contributed to the decision to increase its defense budget and adopt a more strategic approach to security. With the rise of right-wing nationalist movements and the increasing influence of Russia and China, there is growing concern among the German public and policymakers about the security of the country. Increasing the defense budget and taking a more strategic approach to security is seen as a way to address these concerns and reassure the public about Germany's commitment to its own security and that of its allies."
