    "context": "Commentary WHILE GLOBALISATION fatigue seems to set in, protec tionism is emerging. The question that needs to be asked is what is the tren d underlying this phenomenon and how Asia should respond to it. Since the World War II, free trade has been the cor nerstone of the world economy. The establishment of the World Trade Orga nisation (WTO) in 1995 as well as numerous economic partnership and free trade agr eements have promoted free trade based on the concept of comparative advantage . Institutionalisation of trade and advancement of information technology brought the w orld ever closer together. \u2018New Engine\u2019 Getting Old? On the other hand, the postwar period required a ne w engine for the world economy to rebuild the nations devastated by the war. Meanw hile, Germany and Japan have revived their manufacturing industries running trad e surplus against the United States, which they invested in US treasury securities. The US was a major crude oil exporter until the 197 0s. When oil production declined, the US became increasingly dependent on oil from th e Middle East. In turn, the oil producing countries invested their trade surplus in the US treasury securities over the coming decades. Awash with the US dollar, the Bretton Woods system became unsustainable by 1973 and led to the twin deficit during the Reagan admin istration during the 1980s. Still, the growth of financial markets backed by the US dollar continued to support the expanding international trade and world economy in the 1990s and 2000s. US Turns to Protectionism The recycling of the US dollar has run its course w hile major central banks have taken a series of monetary easing policies in response to the global financial crisis in 2008. The resulting low-interest rate environment and sur ging oil price encouraged investment into the oil industry, leading to the US shale revolution in 2011 and pushing its oil production above 1970 level. The rise in the US oil production could contribute to reduction not only in trade deficit but also in the US treasury issuance, thus affectin g the world. The US can now become self-sufficient in energy, reduce its debt i ssuance, and revive its manufacturing industry. In other words, the US needs less free trade and mo re protectionism. However, free trade remains crucial for other countries, especial ly those which mainly export or import oil. This contradiction of benefits resulted in growing tension between policies of the US and its major trading partners. However, it is not necessarily a bad thing. The US government debt burdens future generations and the reduction of it is a national m andate. On the other hand, major foreign US treasury securities holders such as Chin a and Japan can reduce holdings of these assets that sometimes even incur negative returns in their own currency terms. The rest of the world can also become less a ffected by the US monetary policies. Challenges to the World These changes will create new challenges. First, the rise of the US interest rate means repat riation of the dollar circulating in the world, leading to lower liquidity. Hence, the world needs to reduce its dependency on the dollar in trade and finance. Secondly, global s upply chains need to adjust to the new US economy, which tries to revitalise manufactu ring industries. Third, most countries will see their export to the US decline as the US enters trade wars. These new challenges urge the world to adjust to a new form of international trade and to a multi-currency regime. New wisdom and commitments are required to navigate the world economy to a new direction, which is difficult as we are bound by co nventional wisdom. The hollowing out of the manufacturing industries in the US has m ade its society more vulnerable and allowed for racist sentiments to revive. The feelings of despair in the Rust Belt were not s hared by the elites in the East Coast, who have promoted globalisation. Donald Trump liste ned to the people who felt left out. Contrary to being erratic or a racist, he may actually be gearing the US towards the new world. How Should Asia Response? Asia needs to adjust to the protectionism of the US by introducing appropriate and effective counter measures. More fundamentally, Asi a must 1) rebuild international trade via promotion of regional integration and 2) reduce dependency on the dollar. To promote regional integration, countries need to harmonise regulations and standards in trading, banking, and accounting to cr eate larger markets. Free trade agreements such as Comprehensive and Progressive Ag reement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) should be advanced for Asia to remain compet itive in global value chains and to replace the US to become the global consumer mar ket. To reduce the dollar dependency, a multi-currency c learing system must be introduced for energy trade, in particular, for crude oil and liquefied natural gas as currency and energy are the lifeblood of the economy. To strengt hen the liquidity and effectiveness of the multi-currency regime, off-shore markets bas ed on the Japanese yen and the Chinese yuan should be further developed. Stock exchanges in the region should also be deregu lated so that foreign companies can raise capital by tapping into excessive savings that corporate and household sectors have accumulated. While the US military cuts back involvement in the Middle East and potentially in Asia, each region, in particular, the US allies, need to take up more responsibilities to establish a new security framework not relying sole ly on the US. When the US chooses to be \u201cexcluded,\u201d the rest of the world should show leadership to create a new \u201cinclusive\u201d world order. ",

    "context": "Commentary THE ECONOMIC and strategic significance of the Bay of Bengal is growing rapidly with the re-emergence of the idea of the \u2018Indo-Paci fic\u2019 region. This notion assumes that the growing economic, geopolitical and securit y connections between the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean regions are creating a shared strategic space. The Bay is evolving as the centre of the Indo-Pacif ic region again. The renewed focus has given a new lease of life to the developmental efforts in the region, in particular the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multisectoral Tech nical and Economic Cooperation or BIMSTEC. Outlining Changes To revive the region as a distinct community and to promote regional cooperation among the Bay of Bengal\u2019s littoral states, BIMSTEC was established on 6 June 1997 as a regional organisation comprising seven states (five from South Asia: Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka; and two from So utheast Asia: Myanmar and Thailand). As the BIMSTEC process enters the third decade of i ts existence, it has yet to make visible progress in advancing concrete cooperation among the member states. In the last two years, however, member states have investe d some fresh energy to make BIMSTEC a valuable institution for regional integra tion and collaboration. BIMSTEC has a huge potential as a natural platform for development cooperation in a rapidly changing Indo-Pacific region, and the Bay of Bengal region can leverage its unique position as a bridge linking South and South east Asia. BIMSTEC had been mostly overlooked until a renewed push came from India in October 2016, when it hosted an outreach summit wit h leaders of BIMSTEC countries alongside the BRICS summit in Goa. Since then, ther e have been some progress, in BIMSTEC cooperation in several areas including secu rity, counter-terrorism, transport connectivity and tourism, among others. Some timely developments, for example, the BIMSTEC National Security Chiefs meeting, disaster management exercise, launching of a hospital and Tele-medicine network, founding of a centre for weather and clima te, meetings of business chambers and industry associations, helped maintain the mome ntum. Ministerial and senior officials\u2019 meetings motivated member countries for strengthening cooperation in key sectors. Building Bay of Bengal Region Reflecting the growing geopolitical and geoeconomic significance of the Bay of Bengal region, the 4th BIMSTEC Summit was held in Kathmand u on 30-31 August and has generated optimism in the region. The growing value of BIMSTEC and its attempt to generate synergy through collective efforts by memb er states, can be understood, for three key reasons. First, there is a greater appreciation of BIMSTEC\u2019s potential due to the geographical contiguity, abundant natural and human resources, r ich historical linkages and cultural heritage for promoting deeper cooperation in the re gion. Indeed, with a changed narrative and approach the Bay of Bengal has potent ial to become the epicentre of the Indo-Pacific idea \u2013 a place where the strategic interests of the major powers of East and South Asia intersect. Political support and strong commitment from all me mber countries is crucial for making BIMSTEC a dynamic and, effective regional or ganisation. Second, BIMSTEC serves as a bridge between two majo r high-growth centres of Asia \u2013 South and Southeast Asia. Connectivity is essenti al to develop a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable Bay of Bengal region. Th erefore, BIMSTEC needs to address two dimensions of connectivity \u2013 one, upgra ding and dovetailing of national connectivity into a regional roadmap; and two, deve lopment of both hard and soft infrastructures. BIMSTEC Free Trade Area Emerging? The discussions on BIMSTEC Coastal Shipping Agreeme nt and the BIMSTEC Motor Vehicle Agreement are in an advanced stage and are likely to be finalised soon. Similarly, leaders are committed to an early conclu sion of BIMSTEC Free Trade Area negotiations. Involvement of industries and business chambers thr ough BIMSTEC Business Forum and BIMSTEC Economic Forum; BIMSTEC startup conclav e, BIMSTEC Ministerial conclave at the India Mobile Congress to enhance co operation in the areas of information technology and communication, are some examples of various steps taken during the summit. While, the summit has addressed all BIMSTEC priorit y areas, namely, poverty alleviation, connectivity, trade and investment, co unter terrorism and transnational crime, environment and disaster management, climate change, energy, technology, agriculture, fisheries, public health, people-to-pe ople contacts, cultural cooperation, tourism, mountain economy and blue economy, there a re no lofty promises in the declaration. There is an attempt to follow up on ea rlier announcements and to focus on a concrete action plan. Third, the leaders agreed to enhance the institutio nal capacity of the BIMSTEC Secretariat in order to enable the Secretariat to c oordinate, monitor and facilitate implementation of BIMSTEC activities and programmes . Similarly, preparation of a draft charter for the BIMSTEC, enhancing its visibi lity and stature in international fora, is an important step forward. Likewise, India has c ommitted to set up a Centre for Bay of Bengal Studies at the Nalanda University for res earch on art, culture and other subjects in the Bay of Bengal. BIMSTEC: Alternative to SAARC? India\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs remarked in a press briefing before the Summit that BIMSTEC links the unique ecology of the Himalayas t o the Bay of Bengal, reflecting the growing political support and commitment from I ndia. Some experts also envisage BIMSTEC as an alternativ e to the SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) process. Inde ed, BIMSTEC holds a special significance for India in a changing mental map of the region. Certainly, making the Bay of Bengal integral to Ind ia\u2019s \u2018Neighbourhood First\u201d and \u2018Act East\u201d policies could accelerate the process of regi onal integration. Therefore, BIMSTEC matters for India and for the region. ",

    "context": "Commentary OVER THE course of the past decade, the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the fear of a repeat of the 1930 Great Depression had led to the globally concerted efforts by all the major central banks to pursue the unprecede nted monetary measures of quantitative easing (QE) and near zero or below zer o interest rates. Despite the huge sacrifice to the tune of trillions of dollars pumped into the financial system by taxpayers, the past decade was known or l abelled as The Advanced Economies\u2019 Lost Decade . Profit Maximisation At the onset of the global financial crisis in 2007 /2008 originating from the United States subprime mortgage crisis, most countries aro und the world suffered various shocks. These ranged from a liquidity crunch to dow nward pressures on asset prices due to the interconnectedness of global financial m arkets. For most parts of the past decade (2008-2018), the G3 economies (the US, European Union, and Japan) had been on the decline and were relatively less healthy than the emerging economies and some developed countries suc h as Australia and Canada. However, soon after the introduction of QE and hist orically low interest rates, capital flows arising from QE shifted towards the markets o utside of the G3 economies, where short-term relative returns were high and where the re was greater capacity to absorb funds. This extensive overdose of financial measures had c reated a distorted demand in different assets. These included the surge in foreign buying of emerging-market bonds as well as urban housing in a number of cities \u2014 a variant of the ghost cities problem in China. Overpriced Properties By 2014, cities such as Vancouver and Toronto in Ca nada, Auckland in New Zealand, and Sydney and Melbourne in Australia were sufferin g overpriced residential properties, with price-to-income ratios at historic al highs. As a result, many professionals were priced out of the market in thes e cities; at the same time, a number of investors were prepared to own empty houses with the anticipation of further appreciation in prices. The 2013 McKinsey Global Institute Studies had observed that the emerging-market bonds outstanding has climbed by US$5 trillion sinc e 2008, despite the fact only an estimated 15 percent of the overall bond market was foreign owned. Subsequently, following the statements issued by th e US Federal Reserve in May and June 2013 indicating the intention of tightening mo netary policy in late 2013, more than 10 percent decline was observed in the emergin g-market equity and aggregate bond indexes between April and August. Change of Fortune Yet, we observe two divergent trends in the West. EU still faces a number of uncertainties \u0336 the huge surge of refugees from the Middle East and North Africa creates an identity crisis fo r the European population. In addition, Brexit has caught the EU off-guard. To gether with youth unemployment and the rise of nationalism in many EU Member State s, this has instigated many within the EU to clarify the EU vision and purpose in the run-up to the European elections in 2019. In contrast, since 2017, the US - the ground zero o f the last global financial crisis - has experienced changing fortunes. In October 2017, the US Federal Reserve took a decision to terminate QE and to gradually increase interest rates in 2018. Coupled with the upward revision of the US economic growth, improvement in household purchases, enhanced employment opportunit ies since late 2016 and lower taxes under the Trump Administration, the reversal of QE has led to a rebound in asset markets, company mergers and stock buybacks. Furthermore, data compiled by the University of Flo rida as reported in the Wall Street Journal showed that 83 percent of the US-listed initial pu blic offerings (IPO) in 2018\u2019s first three quarters had lost money in the year lea ding up to their IPO. For example, the company SurveyMonkey experienced a 40 percent jump in share prices after its IPO in September 2018, despite never posting a prof itable year. Extreme Economic Weather All the above observations can be attributed to QEs influencing the financial market due to their quantum and domino effects on the fund management community globally. Furthermore, the principle of arbitrage - taking ad vantage of price differences - has directly or indirectly created the herd instinct fo r the movement and direction on the flow of funds. In addition, for decades, the advocacy of the free flow of capital by the internationalist and liberal West was based on their belief in the i mportance of an \u201cefficient market hypothesis\u201d in the market-based economy - without r ealizing how this would facilitate the formation of an economic bubble in the era post -global financial crisis. In line with the rise of footloose capital, the lau nch of QE measures over the past decade has been followed by a rapid influx of capit al into real estate, stock and bond markets in emerging economies and selective develop ed economies that are less affected by the global financial crisis. As the corollary of the \u201cefficient market hypothesi s\u201d, the frequent \u201cdrought and flood\u201d phenomenon in movements of funds as experienced by the emerging markets are synonymous with the sudden shocks of \u201cextreme econo mic weather conditions\u201d due to the policy stances of the G3 central banks. In other words, many economies in the emerging mark ets are like farmers without the means of installing a proper irrigation control sys tem in their financial sector. They are facing the volatile forces of \u201cdrought and flood\u201d i n their economies within a day or shorter. Probability of Currency Meltdown The US is, once again, perceived as the safe haven and land of opportunities as massive funds are flowing back to the US where inve stor sentiments and herd instinct behaviour are unmatched even with respect to the dot.com era in 2000. As of early 2018, the global debt had increased clo se to US$247 trillion - about 300 percent of the global annual output. In parallel, t he drumbeats of the currency crises in the emerging markets are getting louder and wher e unfortunately the \u201cirrigation control valve\u201d is not in the hands of those in char ge in the emerging markets. The prediction of a currency meltdown in some emerging economies is no longer far- fetched. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY THE ASEAN special summit in Jakarta on 24 April 2021 has concluded with a five - point consensus on the Myanmar crisis. It called for cessation of violence, commencement of political dialogue, a constructive role for ASEAN including an opening for an ASEAN delegation, and the allowance of humanitarian assistance. At first glance, analysis of the Chair\u2019s statement showed signs of division \u2013 for instance, a lack of consensus on the release of poli tical prisoners, a necessary precondition for dialogue to begin. Activists criticised that the statement did not go far enough, appearing to show that the summit achieved little. Yet if politics is, to quote the German statesman Otto von Bismarck, about th e \u2018art of the possible\u2019, then it is necessary to set the outcome against a context of impossibilities, dead ends or worse, into which ASEAN did not throw itself. Difficulties with Intervention Disappointment with the summit may be seen in the context of calls for external intervention in Myanmar. This desire to remove the Tatmadaw should be tempered by the reality that this would be costly, risky, and no guarantee of a solution. Nevertheless, criticisms have continued about the failure to take a harder l ine against the junta, either through the UN or ASEAN, with neither path opening after the summit. The UN Security Council is deadlocked, where China and Russia would likely block moves by Western powers. While some therefore conclude that the UN system i s broken, one should think about the scenario where a liberal intervention proceeded without other states\u2019 consent: Myanmar could well become the first proxy battleground in a new front of an emerging \u201cCold War 2.0\u201d, with the conflict sharpening and poss ibly accelerating US -China confrontation. Mainland Southeast Asian states are not unreasonable to baulk at suggestions in this direction, given their experiences during the Cold War. At the regional level, ASEAN\u2019s options are tempered by the political div ersity of its membership and its own historical experiences. When Western powers intervened in post-colonial times, they never did so purely for the sake of democratic values, but always when there was a convergence of material interests to do so, with a b arely - concealed desire to secure those interests in -country for themselves. Iraq, Libya, Syria, and others provide a litany of examples of long, costly, and complex crises, with the West\u2019s own role itself intrinsically linked to the continuation of those c onflicts. In each case, domestic divisions interwove with foreign interests to amplify the conflicts. Roll back further in time and one finds the price of intervention was to have to accept brutal military leaders for whom loyalty to their patron was the primary factor for their grip on power. Post -colonial states in Southeast Asia rightfully reject this option. One thing ASEAN has done well is ensure that cultural and ideological diversity among its members did not lead to conflict. Breaking that formul a in order to \u201cfix\u201d Myanmar risks opening Pandora\u2019s Box for ASEAN member states, and this dismal conclusion unites them notwithstanding sometimes diametrically opposed political systems. Summit\u2019s High Points Within these constraints, therefore, ASEAN has little room for manoeuvre. Yet it managed to accomplish several key things at the summit. First, Tatmadaw Senior General Min Aung Hlaing attended, which was uncertain even days before the summit. He chose to talk to ASEAN and virtually no one else, prov iding a necessary opening from which a solution must be found. Under the gaze of ASEAN leaders, he could not decline ASEAN\u2019s offer, something which he would have de facto accomplished by simply failing to show up. Second, he met UN Special Envoy on Myanm ar Christine Schraner Burgener on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit. While what transpired has been kept under wraps, the mere fact of meeting would have been impossible without his arrival in Jakarta. Third, on ASEAN\u2019s part, it presented one of the most public and interventionist outcome statements the regional grouping has ever delivered to another member state. This represented a big step beyond ASEAN\u2019s usual practices and demonstrated their view of its potential impact on regional security and the impo rtance they have placed on resolution to the crisis. Next Steps While critics lambasted the lack of details, this is overstated. There are few details because ASEAN is in uncharted waters, never having done such action before \u2013 itself a sign of how far ASEAN went to secure this outcome. ASEAN does not commit to things it does not believe it can do. Implementation details will be hammered out in ASEAN capitals and the ASEAN Secretariat soon. However, this is just the start of a long process. While the ou tcome was a big step for ASEAN, the path out of crisis for Myanmar will be a much longer journey. ASEAN has led the figurative horse to water, but it cannot make it drink. During Myanmar\u2019s short -lived democracy, the National League for Democracy (NLD), fai led to resolve federal questions about the country and the Tatmadaw did not learn the soft skills it needed to become a guardian of the country\u2019s future. The Committee Representing the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw has taken first steps to build a more inclusive fr amework and draw in allies through the new National Unity Government (NUG). While the NUG has the soft power, it is the Tatmadaw with the hard power. Both are necessary elements for governance in Myanmar, and only when the parties are willing to begin di alogue will a sustainable solution to the Myanmar crisis become possible. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY IN A US television interview aired on 17 March 2021, President Joe Biden was a sked whether he thought Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin was a killer. In reply, the new American leader said: \u201cI do\u201d. From Moscow, Putin responded by wishing Biden good health. He added: \u201cI am saying this without irony or tongue in cheek ... when we ev aluate other people, or even other states and nations, we are always facing a mirror, we always see ourselves in the reflection, because we project our inner selves onto the other person.\u201d Putin\u2019s Image of Reasonableness: Posturing? Describing the Ameri can people as \u201cmostly honest, decent and sincere\u201d and \u201cwho want to live in peace and friendship with us, something we are aware of and appreciate, and we will rely on them in the future,\u201d Putin criticised US domestic and foreign policy, placing the blame o n the US ruling class. He said that Russia would work with the US but only in areas it is interested in, and on terms beneficial to Russia. Seeking to project an image of reasonableness and signal that Russia is still willing to continue a dialogue, Puti n proposed having a \"live, online\" conversation with the US president. Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, subsequently explained to reporters that the proposal implied open dialogue and not debate, noting that Biden\u2019s remarks \u201care quite unprecedented, so in order not to let these statements harm bilateral Russian - American relations, which are already in a deplorable state, President Putin suggested discussing the situation but doing so openly\u201d. Other Russian officials however took a stronger line. The Fo reign Ministry in Moscow recalled the Russian ambassador in Washington DC for consultations. Vyacheslav Volodin, Speaker of the Duma, described Biden's comments as \"unacceptable,\" adding that \"they offend the citizens of Russia\u201d. Federation Council (Upper House) Deputy Speaker Konstantin Kosachev, also described Biden\u2019s remark as \u201cunacceptable,\u201d warning that they \u201cinevitably lead to a sharp exacerbation of our bilateral ties\u201d. The US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on 22 March that the US wa s anticipating \"tough days\" in relations with Russia. In reaction, Secretary of the Russian Security Council Nikolai Patrushev stressed that the US would be responsible for that. Reflecting Russia\u2019s wish not to worsen the relationship, Patrushev stressed that Russia was \u201ccommitted to constructive cooperation\u201d, adding that \u201cwe haven\u2019t taken any hostile steps against the United States, we are not taking any now, nor are we planning to take any in the future\". Patrushev\u2019s words carry weight, as he is a membe r of Putin\u2019s inner circle. Sword of Damocles over Ties Without directly judging Biden\u2019s remark, Nabila Massrali, spokesperson for the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell, commented as well. She was quoted as say ing on 18 March that there was \u201ca long list of failed \u2013 in some cases, and successful in other cases \u2013 assassinations carried out against critical, independent figures in Russia, including politicians and journalists\u201d. She added that Putin \u201cultimately hold s the responsibility for the Russian authorities, Russian policy and actions\u201d. According to a European Council press statement of 22 March, European Council president, Charles Michel, said that EU relations with Russia are at a \u201clow point\u201d. Yet, the EU must exercise caution vis -\u00e0-vis Russia, since the latter is a major energy and raw material source, and trade partner with the largest consumer market on the continent. Moreover, Germany and other EU states would like to purchase Russia\u2019s Sputnik V vaccine . The standpoint of Germany is noteworthy. Foreign Minister Heiko Maas expressed no surprise at the \u201cclear language\u201d from the Biden administration on Russia. Nevertheless, he noted that the US had renewed the New START arms control treaty, showing that th e US was ready for dialogue and coming to an agreement with Russia on global challenges. The US\u2019 continued opposition to the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project (the 1,230 km pipeline that will double Russian gas exports to the EU) and Germany\u2019s continue d commitment to it, however, will hang like a sword of Damocles over Russo -US as well as US -German relations. Russian Motivations Putin\u2019s \u201csofter\u201d line towards Biden\u2019s \u201ckiller\u201d remark shows Russia\u2019s interest in ensuring that the bilateral relationship do es not deteriorate irreversibly. It also reflects Putin\u2019s efforts to appear reasonable to his own people as well as the American people, in cognisance of the dissonance of views within the body politic of the US (and Europe). It was not a coincidence tha t Russian state TV, Rossia 24, reported on 20 March that the Russian ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov had expressed his thanks to American citizens for their support of good relations between the two countries. Nevertheless, the \u201charder\u201d approach of top legislators Volodin and Kosachev signals that as a great power, Russia cannot simply react with sangfroid at Biden\u2019s remark. Seeking not to burn Moscow's bridges with the EU, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, during a visit to China on 23 March, pointed out that Russia was ready to build its relations with the EU should it eliminate an \u201canomaly in contacts\u201d (i.e., its unilateral decisions to impose sanctions). He noted that there were \u201conly a few European partner countries that have a desire to act based on their national interests\u201d. (He must have had in mind Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, and France; they account for over half of trade between Russia and the EU, Russia\u2019s leading partner). Delinking from Western -controlled SWIFT? Lavrov sai d that Russia seeks to work with China to reduce the impact of any further sanctions. In that regard, Lavrov proposed the reduction of his country\u2019s \u201cexposure to sanctions by strengthening our technological independence and switching to settlements in nati onal and international currencies other than the dollar\u201d as well as moving \u201caway from using Western -controlled international payment systems\u201d. Lavrov\u2019s statement is not new; in 2018, the then deputy prime minister Arkady Dvorkovich stated that Russian fin ancial institutions and firms were ready to work without SWIFT\u2019s services. As early as 2015, the then prime minister Dmitry Medvedev called attention to perceived Western countries\u2019 threats to restrict Russia\u2019s operations through SWIFT, warning that Russia \u2019s reaction to such a move \u201cwill be without limits\u201d. In the light of Biden\u2019s remark and the announcement of planned US sanctions, Russia does not want more comprehensive US/EU sanctions that might further hurt its economy. Russia also has other common iss ues to resolve with the US such as climate change, the Middle East, Ukraine, Afghanistan, arms control regime and cyberspace governance. For all intents and purposes, Russia\u2019s reaction to the US leader\u2019s remark is deliberately calibrated but it is unlike ly to weaken US or European resolve to impose further sanctions. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY THE RISE of China and the expansion of its naval pr esence in the Indian Ocean and South China Sea have not produced an intense balanc e of power coalition directed against Beijing. Even the military buildup by the U nited States in the Pacific before and after the Pivot to Asia strategy of 2012 has not be en as strong as one would expect if balancing was the intent. It is a puzzle that if balancing against power was automatic why we see only limited activism in the military arena as well as coalition building in the face of Chinese transgressions. Instead of active military balancin g many states are resorting to soft balancing based on institutional mechanisms, limite d coalitions and partial arms buildup. They are arming tepidly and not to the ext ent of creating a proper balance of power equation in the military sense. Even the inst itutional soft balancing efforts are hampered by China\u2019s counter soft balancing as well wedge policies which are encouraging some states to bandwagon with it or rem ain neutral. Puzzle of Non-Balancing The puzzle of non-balancing cannot be explained wit hout reference to China\u2019s grand strategy of expansion. It appears that China has in deed developed asymmetric strategies under the cover of economic globalisatio n and by providing collective and individual economic goods to smaller states in Asia -Pacific, managed to prevent a hard-balancing coalition emerging in the current or der. China\u2019s active effort to frustrate a coalition, eve n a soft balancing variety, is evident in its interactions with potential candidates. In my r ecent book: Restraining Great Powers: Soft Balancing from Empires to the Global E ra (Yale University Press, 2018) I outline the various efforts by states and players such as Japan, India, and ASEAN to use institutions and limited coalitions to balance China\u2019s threatening policies. However, these have received Chinese attention and Beijing has made intense diplomatic efforts to frustrate such soft balancing coalitions from emerging. China is strongly opposed to India\u2019s joining of the quadrilateral soft balancing coalition (or Quad) involving the US, Japan and Australia. At their Wuhan summit in May 2018, Chinese leader Xi Jinping seemed to have successful ly convinced India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi not to include Australia in the now annual trilateral Malabar naval exercises between India, Japan and the US. Beijing is concerned that the Quad may be for soft balancing now, but it has the potential to becoming a hard-balancing coalition. I ndia\u2019s subsequent decision not to actively participate in the US-led infrastructure i nvestment projects involving the three countries suggests that the Chinese wedge strategy has at least worked in the short run. China\u2019s Wedge in ASEAN? Similarly, China has managed to create a wedge amon g ASEAN states when it comes to the South China Sea. ASEAN\u2019s efforts at soft bal ancing via the code of conduct negotiations, ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), ASEAN Plu s 3 all are premised on the expectation of restraining China\u2019s aggressive foray into the South China Sea through soft balancing institutional mechanisms. However, since 2010, ASEAN has been able only to co me up with whittled down resolutions at its annual meetings and during some years even failed to do so due to lack of consensus among members. The Chinese econom ic strategy helps Beijing in this regard. In recent months, even Japan, reeling under the Trump tariff threats has mellowed down its rhetoric and soft balancing effor ts against China. BRI: China\u2019s Mechanism to Prevent Balancing Coaliti ons Analysts have discussed the economic and political pros and cons of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). But they neglect a key funct ion it serves in the strategic arena. Beijing uses economic instruments to prevent a bala ncing coalition, both soft and hard, from emerging in the Indo-Pacific region. The BRI h as come as a major source of investment and infrastructure development for many states in the region. These states are unlikely to join in a military bal ancing coalition against Beijing. Stronger regional powers such as India and Japan ar e hampered by their lack of resources available or committed to regional states nowhere near what China has offered. This places them in the estimation and str ategic calculations of these states in a lower position when it comes to coalition buil ding. The smaller states of South Asia \u2212 Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Maldives (until recently) \u2212 have been effectively wedged from India through B RI and other economic and infrastructure aid that China offers. India is thus forced to offer them economic support, albeit unequal in quantity, in order to pr event them from falling completely into Beijing\u2019s orbit. BRI has helped China to solidify its hard balancing coalition with countries like Pakistan. But not too many others have fallen for a military alignment with China which shows that money can buy some loyalty, but forming a bandwagoning coalition in the 21st century is going to be cumbersome. Making smaller states disinterested and thereby pre venting them from forming balancing coalitions with the US, India or Japan ag ainst its expansionist pursuit may be the most China can achieve for now.

    "context": "COMMENTARY IN 2015, C hina and Pakistan forged strategic links with the signing of the China - Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) agreement. This major tie -up provides Beijing with vital access to the Arabian Sea, while adding an extension to China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) . Pakistan, on its part, benefits economically from the CPEC as it connects to about 58 projects worth about US$62 billion: eight projects to develop Pakistan\u2019s Gwadar port, city and airport in Baluchistan, 21 coal, hydro and solar power plants, power transmission lines, highways, railways and a fibre optic cable project. China saw an economically prosperous and stable Pakistan as politically advantageous and wanted to create a geostrategic connectivity corridor from its resource -rich Muslim Xinjiang provi nce to Pakistan\u2019s Gwadar city and port. CPEC 2.0 Gwadar is strategically important because of its closeness to the Strait of Hormuz, the junction of vital international sea shipping routes. For China, the construction and administration of coal -fired po wer plants within CPEC were good alternative business opportunities for its state -owned enterprises abroad at a time when coal -fired power in China plant projects are being scaled down because of President Xi Jinping\u2019s stronger focus on sustainable power s upply. The previous Nawaz Sharif government and the present Imran Khan -led administration hoped that projects with Chinese technological know -how and money would help upgrade Pakistan\u2019s industrial infrastructure and revitalise its economic development. P akistan\u2019s perennial power shortages and power transmission losses have been major challenges for every Pakistani government. CPEC power plants were to provide a fast remedy. At Pakistan\u2019s request China\u2019s investments were predominantly in coal power plant s. A tax -free Gwadar deep sea port was expected to turn it into a trade and transport hub. Before his election in 2018, Prime Minister Khan pledged to renegotiate CPEC projects. However, the majority of projects was continued. PM Khan recently pledged \u201cto complete CPEC at any cost\u201d when he launched the second phase of the megaproject dubbed CPEC 2.0 in mid -2020. He also increased the military\u2019s role in the CPEC governance when he appointed retired army general Asim Bajwa as chairman of the newly created CP EC Authority. Bajwa was tasked to push ahead with stalled CPEC projects. Even though Pakistan managed the COVID -19 pandemic comparatively well, its economy suffered. Work on CPEC has resumed since June 2020. In spite of Pakistan\u2019s problematic fiscal situ ation, new contracts were recently signed for two hydropower and the Mainline1 railway projects worth $11 billion. In July, a controversial CPEC Authority Bill was introduced, granting the military comprehensive powers and reducing the role of civilian g overnment. In spite of recent corruption allegations against Gen. Bajwa, PM Khan retained him as CPEC chairman. Progress and Problems Information on the progress of CPEC projects is opaque. Some projects have been subdivided into different stages, some s helved or are still without financial closure. PM Khan claims \u201csubstantial progress\u201d. Observers guess that a quarter of the projects have been completed, among them nine power projects (worth $7.9 billion). Nine projects (worth $9.5 billion) are being co nstructed (four coal power, four renewable energy plants and a coal mine). The Gwadar projects are advancing, the Lahore Metro line and part of the Peshawar -Karachi Motorway have been completed. Pakistan faces a vicious cycle of high debt liabilities. It s total debt and liabilities surged to 106% of GDP in 2020 since PM Khan took office. Domestic debt has risen by 35% to about $135 billion. Its foreign reserves have been falling to a low of $13 billion. Its GDP contracted by 2.8 per cent in 2019/20. In 2019 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a $6 billion loan but demanded \u201cdecisive fiscal consolidation to reduce public debt\u201d. In March 2020, PM Khan asked China for a moratorium on its loans to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic. China announced on 7 June 2020, a suspension of debt repayment for 77 developing countries, including Pakistan, under the G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative until December 2020. Pakistan also borrowed $1 billion in 2020 from China to refinance a $6.2 bil lion loan it had secured from Saudi Arabia in 2018. \\ Pakistan received $4.2 billion from the IMF, ADB, World Bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to tie it over the COVID -19 situation. It is estimated that Pakistan owes China between $22 and $30 billion, constituting the largest portion of its external debt it owes to one country. A dangerous debt spiral is looming. Shifting from Oil to Coal The Sharif government\u2019s decision to switch from oil to coal was problematic. Some 70% of all the CPEC pow er plant projects are coal -based. Coal usage is projected to rise from five million tonnes in 2015 to 15 million in 2020, and imports will also rise. Pakistan\u2019s commitment to reduce greenhouse gases under the Paris Agreement will be difficult to achieve. T his coal focus contrasts with China\u2019s newly proclaimed sustainability policy at home. China continues to be involved in coal power plants in its neighbourhood. Most CPEC power plants are based on the Chinese BOOT \u201cbuild, own, operate, transfer\u201d model. Ch inese ownership will be transferred to the Government of Pakistan after 30 years of operation. This raises transparency and accountability questions. Following recent electricity price hikes, a government committee, set up in August 2019, reviewed the role of Independent Power Producers (IPP). It recently found serious \u201cmalpractices\u201d by IPPs like inflated operating costs and high annual profits. Pressure is mounting on Pakistan\u2019s PM Khan by the newly founded opposition \u201cPakistan Democratic Movement\u201d to en sure efficacy of CPEC projects. For years, Baluchistan separatists and insurgents have been fighting the government. CPEC projects have become targets and are increasingly unpopular among the Baluchistan population. The Pakistani Army launched major secu rity operations but seems to have been rather heavy -handed in its approach. Alleged extrajudicial arrests by the military have resulted in a loss of confidence in the government. Five years after the start of CPEC, Pakistanis demand greater transparency and accountability. It is in the mutual interests of both governments to ensure that tangible benefits reach the Pakistani population soon and that greater transparency is achieved. Pakistan\u2019s fiscal and economic woes, compounded by the effects of the pand emic, do not leave much room for manoeuvre. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY WHILE THE world ushered in the New Year, an important event happened on the trade front in the Asia -Pacific. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) officially entered into force on 1 January 2022 \u2500 a massive free trade agreement (FTA) covering about 30 percent of the world\u2019s population and global GDP. Critics argue that RCEP is a shallow agreement compared to the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans -Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) that was praised as the gold standard of trade deals. However, a closer look reveals that RCEP will promote further trade integration and facilitat ion of the Asia -Pacific region as it harmonises and consolidates bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs) among member countries while galvanising regional supply chains. Benefits of Participating in RCEP There are at least four benefits of participation i n RCEP. The first concerns RCEP\u2019s trade liberalisation effects. Critics argue that RCEP does not yield large tariff reductions because several parties have already formed bilateral trade agreements, especially through ASEAN -Plus-One FTAs. Some also point out that RCEP will bring in gradual tariff reduction in the region as its tariff concessions remove tariffs on 92% of goods traded within the bloc with an implementation period of 20 years, while allowing for exemptions for sensitive sectors. However, this argument downplays RCEP\u2019s core trade liberalisation effects, which stem from some of its specific features. As a mega -regional FTA, RCEP has unified rules of origin (ROO) that determine whether goods can be regarded as originating from member countries and thus eligible for preferential custom duties.

    "context": "COMMENTARY PRESIDENT JOKO Widodo wanted a quick fix to Indonesia\u2019s problems attracting foreign investment, and Parliament has given him the tool he wante d \u2013 but the leader now has a new headache on top of the giant one from COVID -19, and efforts to lure investors are unlikely to produce results anytime soon. On 5 October 2020, Parliament quickly approved a thick bill entitled \u201c Cipta Kerja (Job Creation)\u201d aimed at slashing red tape and making it easier for investors to create employment for millions of jobless Indonesians. Based on the title, it would seem the new law would be welcomed \u2013 but the reaction has been the opposite. Resistance to Omnibus Bill The law \u201ctramples\u201d on workers and will benefit only capitalists and conglomerates, complained the chairman of the largest Islamic organisation Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) \u2013 whose past leader of its Syurah (Supreme Council) is now Widodo\u2019s vice -president. Amnesty International\u2019s Jakarta representative blasted the legislation as a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d for human rights and labour. Social media was filled with attacks on planned changes in labour and environmental policies. Governors of some Indonesian provinces called on Jokowi, as the president is more widely known, to revoke the law. And there was negative reaction in the streets, with protests in dozens of cities for three days last week, some of them turning violent. Crowds included students unhappy with Jokowi and so me people reportedly hired to make trouble by individuals with political agendas. Still, there were thousands of workers who showed their disapproval of the legislation known as the \u201comnibus\u201d bill. Opposition to his initiative to win over investors is th e latest in a series of setbacks for Jokowi this year. COVID -19 has thrust millions back into poverty and the country into its first recession since the Asian Financial Crisis more than 20 years ago. The need to jack up state spending to help the poor has meant construction of a proposed Indonesian capital in East Kalimantan \u2013 what Jokowi sees as a legacy project -- cannot start this year. The ambitious omnibus bill, in one go, amends 79 existing laws that contain overlapping or contradictory policies. Pro ponents of the bill hail it is a necessary effort to reduce cumbersome licensing requirements and paperwork in highly -bureaucratic Indonesia. A World Bank economist has said the bill would have the potential to \u201cturbo - charge\u201d Indonesia\u2019s economic recovery from COVID -19. While businesspeople generally welcome the law \u2013 and had the most input on its proposals \u2013 there has been strong resistance from civil society groups, who said they weren\u2019t able to give inputs, to proposed changes in labour and environment laws. Attention on those areas may have obscured how much ground the law seeks to cover. The independent Centre for Indonesian Policy Studies (CIPS) applauded changes in food and agriculture policies, including removing a 30% cap on foreigners\u2019 stakes i n plantation, horticulture and livestock businesses. Jokowi: \u2018We Have a Problem\u2019 But a week after the bill was approved, it remained embarrassingly uncertain what the final version said, as it wasn\u2019t available and multiple drafts were circulating. The of ficial reason for the delay: typographical errors were getting cleaned up. Under Indonesian rules, a bill passed by Parliament will automatically become law in 30 days even if the president doesn\u2019t sign it. NU said it will ask the Constitutional Court to reject the law, though it\u2019s not clear what grounds the group will cite -- and analysts doubt the court will rule the legislation is unconstitutional. The bill stemmed from Jokowi realising last year how badly Indonesia was faring in attracting manufactur ers shifting production to Southeast Asia from China because of US import tariffs. The World Bank said that of 33 relocations, 23 went to Vietnam and none to Indonesia. \u201cWe have a problem,\u201d Jokowi lamented. He thought an omnibus bill would reduce what he called \u201cregulatory obesity\u201d: Also, he was sure of getting it through Parliament, having support from nearly 75% of its members. (He didn\u2019t have a majority in the first term). Jokowi wanted Parliament, which received the massive original draft in February, to act within 100 days. But then came COVID -19, and some stumbles by his government, which many saw as slow and ineffective in combatting it. In April, Parliament began deliberating the omnibus bill, and si nce September it expedited handling. Rigid Labour Market After the legislation was passed, Jokowi didn\u2019t say anything publicly for four days \u2013 during which anti -bill activity proliferated. When he did speak, the president said opponents were \u201cmisinformed \u201d and many \u201choaxes\u201d misled people. He challenged opponents to go the Constitutional Court to try to block it. One major focus of opposition is change to a 2003 labour law that was pushed by then-President Megawati Sukarnoputri, who was about to be in the first direct presidential vote (which she lost). That law gave workers maximum severance pay of 32 months\u2019 wages, one of the world\u2019s highest levels. Business groups have long pushed to reduce that level. Capital Economics, a consultancy, says one reason Indonesia has struggled to develop the labour -intensive manufacturing base that has underpinned success elsewhere in Asia is a \u201crigid labour market which makes it difficult to hire and fire workers\u201d. A draft of the new law reduces the maximum to 25 months , with the employer paying 19 and the government covering six months under a new unemployment insurance scheme. Opponents of changes in labour law contend the government could have detached the section from the bill and taken it up later, after COVID -19 has been contained and the economic situation isn\u2019t so grim. They also question how the unemployment insurance is going to work, with the government currently cash -strapped. Answer to Jokowi\u2019s Troubles ? The answers to that and other questions about the la w are supposed to come in the \u201cimplementing regulations\u201d for legislation. Think -tank CIPS sounded a cautionary note on such regulations. \u201cIndonesia is notorious for the slow or failed implementation of new laws,\u201d it said. \u201cEnforcing this new law across 34 provinces will be no easy feat.\u201d Jokowi said the implementing regulations will be completed within three months \u2013 which would be surprisingly fast for Indonesian bureaucracy. The chief economics minister, Airlangga Hartarto, has said Jokowi wants it done in one month. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible,\u201d says Yanuar Nugroho, deputy chief of staff to Jokowi in his first term. The wait for those regulations and the fact there are almost no visitors to Indonesia at present, due to COVID -19, mean it could be a long time bef ore a bid to increase foreign investment produces results. A key will be implementation of the law, as investors in Indonesia need \u2013 and often don\u2019t have \u2013 legal certainty ( kepastian hukum ). The situation will remain fluid and attention will now be on Jokowi and the decisions he will make about the law. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY AT THE historic Bretton Woods Conf erence of 1944, to address the economic instability of the 1930s, a set of rules -based international economic institutions (IEIs) that are collectively referred to as the global economic architecture (GEA) was established under the leadership of the United States. This architecture comprised the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for macroeconomic and monetary stability; the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \u2013 the predecessor of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to promote trade openness; and the World Bank to provide development finance for poverty reduction. Although it had several critical flaws, the Bretton Woods GEA worked well for more than 60 years arguably until the eruption of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). It ushered in the golden age of globalisation and brought about economic growth and prosperity all over the world. Gradualist Reform & the Changed Context Reforms of this architecture have been implemented in an incremental and gradual manner. These comprise (i) the establishment of the G7 in 1975 and its upgradation to the G20 summit in the aftermath of the GFC; (ii) a shift to a floating system of exchange rates in 1973 after the collapse of the pegged rates of the Bretton Woods monetary arrangement; (iii) the establishment of the Financial Stability Forum and its upgrading to the Financial Stability Board after the GFC; and (iv) the transitioning from GATT to the WTO in 1995. More recently, the context in which the global IEIs operate has changed in two important ways. First, the unipolar world with the US as the sole superpower has become multi -polar where economic and political power has shifted to some extent to the dynamic emerging markets, particularly those in Asia such as China and India. These emerging markets have sought a greater voice in the operation of the IEIs. But the major Western shareholders remain antipathetic to the required changes in rules and policies. Second, during the Bretton Woods era, policymakers were wary of uncontrolled finance and had imposed restri ctions on cross -border flows of capital. In the 1990s, under the so -called Washington Consensus, countries around the world deregulated their capital accounts. Over time, this has produced highly integrated global financial markets and capital flows that h ave dwarfed the regulatory capacity and operations of IEIs. With financial globalisation, a new type of crisis associated with large capital inflows and their sudden reversals have become more frequent occurring every 10 to 12 years. In addition to insta bility, financial globalisation has also led to intra - and inter - country income inequality. Calls for Big Bang Reforms: Bretton Woods 2.0? Calls have, therefore, been made for a comprehensive reform of the Bretton Woods GEA. In the post -GFC period, a num ber of academics and politicians had called for a New Bretton Woods (NBW), a wider and more comprehensive reform of the GEA. These had included Professor Joseph Stiglitz and politicians like Nicholas Sarkozy and Gordon Brown. The then central bank govern or of China, Zhou Xiaochuan, had also made a pitch for a new international reserve asset to replace the US dollar and its hegemony. The calls for a NBW fizzled out at the interregnum stage because the recovery from the GFC turned out to be faster than ex pected and the world experienced a Great Recession rather than the originally expected repeat of the Great Depression of the 1930s. This led to complacency and dilution of reform proposals. Similar calls for comprehensive reforms of the Bretton Wood GEA h ave been made in the wake of the COVID -19 pandemic which has led to the worst global economic downturn since the Great Depression. According to the latest IMF estimate, world output shrank by 3.1% in 2020 as compared to 0.1% in 2009. Gallaghar and Kozul -Wright have noted that inequality, indebtedness, and insufficient productive investments have become the new normal and called for a renewed multilateral order. Tinkering with existing rules cannot provide the way out. Vines argues that the world now faces two choices (i) revisit the direction of t he mid - 1940s when ruled based GEA were established or (ii) return to the path of the 1930s when weak cooperation led to an economic depression and eventually a world war. He adds that the crises of this century proves that there is an urgent need for funda mental reform by learning lessons from history. What lessons can be learned from COVID -19 and the invasion of Ukraine? Will they be game -changing events and lead to the overhaul of the global economic architecture? If so, how? Going Forward Looking for ward, will the calls for Big Bang reform of the Bretton Woods GEA be realised any time soon? Probably, not. This is because with the recent rise in nationalism and populism worldwide and the on -going conflict between the US and China and the Russia -Ukraine War, the political will to spur global cooperation and coordination is weak and risk of yet another East -West divide reminiscent of the Cold War era world order is genuine. Under former President Trump, the US had embraced the \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy and protectionism pivoting away from multilateralism of the past to \u201cunilateralism\u201d and \u201cbilateralism\u201d. President Biden is supportive of multilateralism but still many of the tariffs that were imposed on about 20% of total imports of the US remain. Similarl y, European countries had initiated policy actions to protect their economies especially from rising inflows of migrant workers from the Middle East. Countries around the world also retaliated and became more inward -looking. Although it remains an export p owerhouse, China has also stressed the importance of domestic market when it rolled out the \u201cdual circulation\u201d policy paradigm. Since 2020, India has also adopted a more self -reliant policy. Rising nationalism and growing emphasis on economic security hav e dimmed the environment for global cooperation. Countries are preferring to \u201cgo it alone\u201d rather than cooperate with others. Weak political will is the main reason why the G20 has failed to craft a coordinated global response to the unprecedented COVID -19 pandemic. In the medium -term, therefore, reforms of the Bretton Woods GEA are expected to be incremental and gradual rather than Big Bang. The key focus of reforms should be to provide global public goods in a shared manner by promoting complementarity between global and regional IEIs that have been recently established. The centralised Bretton Woods GEA is gradually moving towards a decentralising GEA with the co -existence of \u201csenior\u201d global IEIs and a plethora of new regional institutions. The world could be in for a turning point in the wake of the Ukraine War. How the sea - change will emerge remains to be seen. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY ON 29 JUNE 2020, four militants of a Baloch insurgent group, the Baloc h Liberation Army (BLA), stormed the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSE), the financial nerve centre of the country. However, the attackers were neutralised by the security guards stationed outside the PSE building's main gate. The attack left seven people, including four militants and three security personnel, dead and as many injured. Before this, a series of attacks on the security force s in Balochistan and Sindh provinces as well as the re -emergence of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement London (MQM -L)'s militant wing in Karachi point to the revival of ethno -separatist groups in Pakistan. Though Pakistan's top political and military leadership have hinted at alleged Indian involvement in the PSE attack , there is a troubled history of mistrust and ethnic grievances in Balochistan and Sindh fueling recruitment and driving ethnic violence. The Baloch and Sindhi separatist groups have forged a new tactical alliance against Chinese economic interests in Pakistan. Ethno -Separatist Groups in Pakistan This new wave of violence in Pakis tan should be seen in the broader context of shifting geopolitical sands in South Asia, which have thrown up new opportunities to several militant groups. The expected US withdrawal from Afghanistan, the intra -Afghan peace process and the growing Chinese e conomic footprint under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) are leading to geopolitical realignments in the region. Given its pivotal position at the crossroads of South and Central Asian regions, Pakistan finds itself in the crosshairs of these geopolitic al developments. Of the 73 militant groups banned by the National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA) , Pakistan's central counter -terrorism agency, 13 are ethno -separatists. The lack of an inc lusive development model and ham -fisted policies of the state lie at the heart of political alienation and socio -economic grievances in Sindh and Balochistan. The onset of the US$62 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the flagship project of the Chinese BRI, in Balochistan has further disenfranchised the Baloch groups. CPEC, which originates from China's Xinjiang province and culminates at Balochistan's Gwadar port, is a series of infrastructure projects involving highways, rail tracks, ports and electric grid stations, among others. Baloch Separatist Groups Balochistan is rich in minerals and due to its lucrative location, has the potential to be developed into a vibrant economic hub in the future. For instance, Balochistan's Reko Diq copper and gold mine has an estimated $5.9 billion in copper reserves and $4.5 million in gold reserves. The Baloch fear that they will be turned into a minority in their province and robbed of their rich mineral resources. The Baloch separatist groups view China as a coloniser and aggressor . Claiming responsibility for the PSE attack, BLA's spokesperson maintained \"it was intended to target the Pakistani economy and Chinese economic interests, in response to China's exploitative plans in Balochistan,\" an apparent reference to China's 40 per cent ownership of the PSE. In 2016, a Chinese conglomerate, consist ing of China Financial Futures Exchange Company Limited, Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange, combined with Pak -China Investment Company Limited and Habib Bank Limited to purchase 40 per cent PSE shares. BLA also carried out the 2018 Chine se consulate attack in Karachi and the 2019 Pearl Continental Gwadar attack. BLA's Majid Brigade has been specially created to target Chinese interests and projects in Pakistan. In September last year, four Baloch militant groups  \u0336 BLA, the Balochistan L iberation Front, the Baloch Republican Guard and the Baloch Republican Army  \u0336 formed a new alliance, the Baloch Raji Ajoi Sangar (BRAS) . The BRAS has been established to pool together human and financial resources to extend these groups\u2019 geographical outreach, improve operational coordination and diversify attack targets in Pakistan. Sindhi Separatist Groups Two types of separatist groups operate in Sindh, the MQM -L affiliated militant wing, the Mohajir Resistance Force, operating in Karachi and the Sindhi separatist groups such as the Sindhudesh Revolutionary Army (SRA) and Sindhudesh Liberation Army (SLA)  \u0336 active in the interior parts of the province. On 19 June, SRA targeted Sindh Rangers in three separate attacks in Ghotki, Karachi and Larkana . The reactivation of MQM -L's militant wing in Karachi also fits into the broader pattern of the revival of ethno -separatist groups in Pakistan. On June 26, the Sindh Rangers and Karachi police arrested three terrorists belonging to the MQM -L's militant wing who were planning low -intensi ty attacks in different parts of the port city. The post -arrest investigations also revealed that MQM -L is re -organising several small cells to carry out terrorist attacks in Karachi. Revision of Internal Security Framework In light of the evolving securi ty environment, Pakistan's internal security framework enshrined in the National Action Plan (NAP), a 20 -point counter -terrorism and extremism roadmap, formed in January 2015 needs to be revised. Critical points of the NAP included eliminating terrorist i nfrastructure, madrassa reforms and the ban on hate speech, among others. NAP's lopsided focus on hard measures and less than ideal implementation on soft measures make Pakistan's counter -terrorism gains fragile and reversible. The structural factors of v iolence such as religious intolerance, poor socio -economic conditions and ethno -nationalist grievances remain unaddressed in Pakistan. As long as structural factors are not addressed, violence, whether religiously inspired or ethnically motivated, would li kely continue to re -erupt in Pakistan. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY IT IS futile to debate whether Russian President Vladimir Putin had anticipated the determination and unity of Europe or was surprised by it . But as a matter of fact, the European Union (EU) and its member states are currently untying several \u201cGordian Knots\u201d at once. Take Germany as an example: Russian aggression has achieved what decades of US diplomacy could not: Berlin is finally realising that Germany must take care of its own, and by extension European, security. For decades, Germany\u2019s European neighbours, from France to Poland, as well as successive US administrations have tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to put an end to German free -riding on the NA TO and US security umbrella. Berlin had long been lacking to both equip its armed forces, the Bundeswehr, adequately and to think strategically about the defence of and challenges for Germany and Europe. The Historic German Volte -face Despite being the second largest NATO economy, hitherto, it was hopeless to expect Germany to meet its NATO defence budget obligations of 2% of GDP. Berlin\u2019s strategic culture , domestic politics and an entrenched public pacificism made raising the defence budget as difficult as developing a realistic security strategy appropriate for a country so prone to geopolitical challenges. Likewise, the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with Moscow was long a \u201choly cow\u201d of Berlin\u2019s diplomacy, preventing both the export of arms to Ukraine as wel l as unambiguously joining its NATO allies in hard -balancing Russian influence. For example, the much - discussed gas pipeline Nordstream 2 was, despite its obvious geo -strategic nature, long described as a \u201ccommercial project\u201d by successive German governments. In a series of dramatic moves within just a few days, Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced a historic volte -face that seemed to take even members of his own government by surprise. Upending decades -old fundamental principles of German foreign and security policy, Berlin is now delivering lethal weapons to Ukraine, announced a one -off tripling of th e defence budget as well as the intent to henceforth meet NATO\u2019s spending target. Likewise, to reduce Germany\u2019s significant dependency on Russian energy imports (every fourth household relies on Russian gas for heating), even Green party leaders agree tha t Berlin will now likely have to postpone its exit from both coal - and nuclear - energy, and Nordstream 2 is now all but finished. New EU Unity The President of the European Commission announced a series of measures that denoted a similarly remarkable shif t in EU Common Security and Defence Policy. Most astonishing for an organisation that self -identifies as a \u201cnormative actor\u201d, the EU will now for the first time finance lethal weapons. To that end, \u20ac450 million will go towards Ukrainian armament \u2013 a countr y that is not even a member. Beyond defence, member states demonstrated unusual unity in agreeing to substantial sanctions against Russia, including the long -resisted removal of Russia\u2019s leading banks from SWIFT. Not only will this come at significant cos ts for European economies themselves, but this agreement also bridges the traditionally significant divergence in European perspectives on economic and diplomatic relations with Moscow. No less remarkable, only six years after the so -called refugee crisi s brought the EU close to breaking point, even those member states that long resisted EU -wide refugee distribution, indeed were opposed to receiving any migrants at all, are now welcoming Ukrainian refugees with open arms. Never Waste A Crisis: Europe\u2019s Moment of Truth \u201cEurope will be forged in crisis\u201d, Jean Monnet, one of the EU\u2019s founding fathers, famously asserted. Indeed, there seems to be nothing quite like a geopolitical crisis to remind member states of the mutual security imperative of r egional integration, to galvanise and unify Europe. Indeed even Boris Johnson shows a renewed interests in cooperation with the EU. This momentum should not be squandered. In the medium -term, there might be a welcomed spill -over effect, possibly solving one of Europe\u2019s most intractable problems: creating a functioning migration regime. If the rest of the EU shows now this forthcoming solidarity with its Eastern member states that these states lacked during the 2015 refugee crisis, Europe might once again find the cooperative spirit to progress with deeper integration and policy reform, strengthening Europe\u2019s collective capacity. Similarly, substantial German investment in defence can significantly enhance Europe\u2019s defence capacity and work towards Europe\u2019 s ability to implement own strategic objectives. Mindful that a shortage of money was never the Bundeswehr\u2019s primary problem, greater defence spending must be accompanied by structural reforms and strategic embedding of German capabilities in a European fr amework. A Re -energised Europe? Lastly, part of the truth about Europe\u2019s new unity is the fact that for the first time in decades, Washington very closely cooperated with both NATO allies and the EU institutions on a collective response to a security cri sis. This cooperative spirit is, however, highly dependent on personalities rather than permanent structural change of US foreign policy. It is indeed likely that a second Trump administration had reacted very differently, side -lining rather than galvanis ing European cooperation, which would likely have led to political inertia rather than resolve in Europe. It is time to seriously consider advancing Europe\u2019s \u201cstrategic autonomy\u201d. This does not mean competition with NATO. Rather, strategic autonomy should be a European capacity to determine own strategic interests with the means to achieve them \u2013 complementary with but independent from NATO. Putin has unwittingly shaken Europe out of complacency. The previously unimaginable is suddenly reality, and the E U is already stronger and more effective and attractive than before Putin\u2019s war against Ukraine. A second \u201cBrexit -like\u201d scenario seems unlikely now, and if there is only one good thing that may come out of this tragedy, it might be a re -energised Europe. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY IN A period of rapid advancement in artificial inte lligence and machine learning, policymakers and private sector leaders are recogni sing the need for ethics and norms building in artificial intelligence (AI). And while the US government and tech sector have independently made strides incorporating ethic al principles into the development of AI systems, the absence of a shared language and culture between government and industry has impeded meaningful, ongoing debate . Tech companies have struggled to transition from dr afting AI ethical frameworks to actually implementing them, an issue exacerbated by a lack of accountability in the companies internally, as well as a lack of oversigh t from the US Congress. Ensuring the right ethical principles are built into AI syst ems is no easy feat. And if the US government and tech sector want to advance the conv ersation on AI ethics from written charters to tangible actions, they must wor k through these complex ethical questions together. The Evolving Conversation on AI Ethics in the Unite d States Earlier this year, the White House announced its \u201c American AI Initiative ,\u201d a strategy that calls upon individual agencies to prioritise r esearch and development into AI. And while the Initiative does not directly mention the need for ethics in AI, it does recognise the public\u2019s mounting concern around data privacy a nd acknowledges the need for international cooperation to ensure confidence and trust in AI systems. Soon after the White House announced its AI Initiat ive, the Pentagon released its own strategy framed around the concept of a \u201chuman-centered app roach to AI\u201d. In an effort to dispel public fears of killer robots and showcas e the beneficial uses of AI, the strategy focused not on AI and lethality, but on de veloping AI systems that are robust, reliable, and secure. In addition to the Pentagon\u2019s strategy, the Defence Innovation Board (DiB), an advisory council made up of primarily private indus try leaders, is in the latter stages of developing a series of \u201c AI Principles for Defence .\u201d The DiB hopes these principles will guide the Pentagon\u2019s development and use of AI syst ems moving forward. On the other side of the country, giants in the tec h community \u2014 Microsoft, Google, Facebook, IBM, among others \u2014 have announced their own initiatives in AI ethics. These initiatives have often come in the form of a series of ethical principles, an independent ethics board, or the sponsorship of a r esearch lab studying AI ethics and norms. Barriers to Building Ethics into AI Systems The US government and the tech industry have made p rogress on developing ethical approaches in AI, yet both communities are struggli ng to move from written declarations of intent toward meaningful, transpare nt action. This transition from word to deed is obstructed by a number of barriers origi nating from both the government and tech sector. Barrier #1: The relationship between the US governm ent and the tech industry is tainted by mistrust and a lack of a shared language and culture. A chasm between the tech sector and the US governme nt, particularly the Defence Department, has thwarted an ongoing dialogue on wha t a fair and ethical AI-enabled system might look like and how it should be deploye d. Mistrust permeates the relationship between the two communities and is acc entuated by a lack of a shared language and culture. The strained relationship between the Defence Depar tment and tech sector was on heightened display in the aftermath of Google\u2019s withdrawal from the Pentagon\u2019s Project Maven. Google employees penned a letter to the company\u2019s leadership declaring that \u201cGoogle should not be in the busines s of war\u201d. While employees from Google and the Defence Departm ent may have differing views for how AI should be used, both entities want to en sure that the AI systems they develop and deploy are trustworthy, responsible, an d secure. The US government and tech sector need each other t o help navigate these complex but critically important questions around ethics an d norms in AI. Mending this rift is essential to ensuring that AI algorithms being deve loped are fair and abide by ethical standards. Barrier #2: Tech companies lack oversight and accou ntability mechanisms to execute on and abide by their own ethical principles. The ethical frameworks developed by many companies in the tech community reflect common themes: the desire to promote AI for social good, to reduce bias in AI algorithms, and to be accountable and transparent t o the company\u2019s massive user base. While these principles seem to reflect a prio ritisation and embracement of ethics in AI, the actual levers of implementation for thes e principles are opaque. And without transparency, oversight, and accountability mechani sms in place, there is little to incentivise or compel private sector companies to a bide by and implement the ethical standards they propagate. Barrier #3: US congressional engagement is needed t o hold the tech sector accountable, but tech literacy amongst congressiona l members poses a substantial challenge. Over the past year, numerous congressional hearings , most notably a hearing with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, have made it abundant ly clear that there is a significant dearth of tech literacy amongst congres sional members. And in the absence of familiarity with these technologies that are rapidly being integrated into American society, it will become increasingly diffi cult for Congress to perform its critical regulatory and oversight functions. Overcoming Barriers to Building Ethics into AI Syst ems To ensure the AI systems built today and deployed t omorrow are responsible and trustworthy, the US government and tech sector must establish mechanisms and safeguards for accountability and oversight. And th ese mechanisms for oversight must be transparent to the population primarily affected by these advancements \u2014 the American public. In the private sector, accountability should come f rom both internal and external sources. Internally, companies should establish an independent review board, similar to those that exist at universities and hospitals, to ensure a company abides by its adopted ethical standards. Externally, the US Congress must begin to flex its oversight and regulatory powers and hold tech companies accountable. The proposed Algorithmic Accountability Act , which would require companies to correct algorithms that are biased, inaccurate, and discriminatory, would be an ideal first step. But to ensure that Congress remains effective in th is oversight role, increased tech literacy for congressional members is key. To legis late on these issues, lawmakers should hire additional staffers focused on emerging technologies, as well as restore the Office of Technology Assessment, the expert bod y that advised politicians on technological issues until it was defunded two deca des ago. Most importantly, to ensure the US is a leader in b uilding AI systems that are fair and trustworthy, the government and tech sector must wo rk in tandem on these issues. Because the barriers to ensuring ethics are built i nto AI systems are steep, but certainly not insurmountable. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY THE TRUCE between the United States and China has f inally ended, as the trade talks collapsed in Washington DC last month. As of 10 May 2019 at 12:01 am, US increased tariff rates from 10% to 25% on US$200 bi llion worth of Chinese goods that included 5,745 items. After three days, China immed iately responded by declaring that they would impose tariffs of up to 25% on 5,140 Ame rican products amounting to $60 billion. On the same day, the United States Trade Representa tives (USTR) drafted a list of 3,805 Chinese products valued at approximately $300 billion dollars that could be subject to potential tariffs up to 25%. On 30 May, it was reported that China put on hold the purchase of American soybeans that come fr om the Midwest farm belt, the core constituencies of the US president Donald Trum p. And before leaving for the D- Day Ceremony in Normandy recently, US President Don ald Trump made another fresh threat that he could go for tariffs on anothe r $300 billion of Chinese goods at the right time, which means he might slap tariffs on vi rtually every Chinese export. Tit-for-Tat Tit-for-tat tariff strategies by the two great powe rs are one of the worst outcomes from the breakdown of the talks, but they are not that s urprising, since the US and China had already gone through similar phases last year. What was not fully expected this time is that the s tandoff between the US and China that started as skirmishes over tariff issues is no w taking a completely new turn, as the two countries are plunging into conflicts over almost everything, including technology, diplomatic, and geopolitical issues wit h no signs of ending. Even when the two sides announced retaliatory tarif fs against each other in May, there seemed to be a silver lining for a negotiated settl ement, since the two countries were evidently seeking concessions, delaying the effects of retaliatory tariffs until imports from one country reach the port of another on 1 Jun e. Then why did the US-China trade talk fail all of sudden? Differing Expectations Many sources say that the two parties had quite dif ferent expectations about implementation of the draft agreement, which was co mplicated by the dynamics of domestic politics in each side. Last March, China p assed a new Foreign Investment law at the National People\u2019s Congress in efforts to attract foreign investors, while the trade conflict with the US has sparked its economic downturn. Chinese officials were quite reluctant to make any further legal changes to improve the outcome of the trade talks, as they believe tha t the newly drafted investment law provides foreign firms with fair treatment and prot ection from illegal interference from the Chinese government. The Trump administration and American firms did not agree. Like the European Union and many other critics, they see that China\u2019s new i nvestment law does not really go very far, as it remains vague and broad on the issu es of forced technology transfers, intellectual property rights, and know-how disclosu re. China wanted to carry out the agreement by administ rative actions without legal commitments. In contrast, the US wanted to specify changes that China needs to make in legal terms and publicly disclose them in o rder to institutionalise an enforcement mechanism. Both sides were equally conc erned about domestic criticisms of weak deals. Evolution of Trade War Recent developments after the breakdown of the trad e talks show that the current standoff between the US and China is not just trigg ered by the spontaneous reactions of strong leaders. The two great economies have ind eed embarked on a war over a new global order that will not be resolved any time soon. By implementing toughest sanctions on China\u2019s Huawe i and declaring a national emergency on information security, the Trump admini stration made it clear that they are seeking to thwart \u2018Made in 2025\u2019, a blueprint f or China\u2019s developmental plans to become a manufacturing powerhouse with an emphasis on high-tech sectors. It is worth noting that the US\u2019 current stance on C hina has no bipartisan differences. Despite their ongoing feuds, the Democratic Party a sked the Trump administration to be tough on China\u2019s \u201cbad behaviours,\u201d including reg ulatory behaviours, unfair trade practices, and human rights issues. Strong statements on the Tiananmen Square protests came from both the US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Secretary of the State Mike Pompeo, while the US House passed pro-Taiwanese bills at around the same time. Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping urged the C hinese people to start the new \u201cLong March\u201d with loyalty and unity for the nation\u2019 s great survival during his visit to Jiangxi province, where the Red Army of the Chinese Communist Party undertook its historic military retreat against the Kuomintang fr om 1934 to 1935. Jiangxi province is also housing mining facilities for rare earth miner als that China might weaponise in its trade war with the US. Emerging Dilemmas How would the US-China frictions affect the global trading system? The damage seems to have been already done. The IMF Director C hristine Lagarde has recently warned that retaliatory tariffs by the US and China will cause a reduction of 2020 global growth by $455 billion. Another dilemma in the current spat between the US and China is that some countries will be forced to take sides, as shown in the relat ionship between the US, China, and South Korea. Harry Harris, the US Ambassador to Sou th Korea has recently urged Korean telecommunication companies not to use Huawe i network equipment, emphasising the importance of a reliability of 5G s uppliers for national security. It was just a day after Chinese diplomats warned th e Korean press that Korea should make a good judgement instead of following the pref erences of the US. It remains to be seen whether Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping will resolve the deadlock between the two countries at the G20 Summi t in Japan later this month as they did in Buenos Aires in December 2018. Whatever the outcomes, it will be still subject to certain volatility caused by the two cou ntries\u2019 fight over global hegemony. ",

    "context": "Commentary SINCE THE recapture of Marawi City by government fo rces in October 2017, militants affiliated with the self-proclaimed Islamic State ( IS) have been pushed back into a strategic retreat. On 24 January 2018, Colonel Rome o Brawner, deputy commander of the Joint Task Force Marawi, stressed that even though hundreds of militants were killed in the battle, there are still IS-affiliated supporters and sympathisers who continue to pursue the goal of establishing an IS-s tyled regime in Southeast Asia. On 20 January 2018, members of the IS-affiliated Ma ute Group disembarked on the southwest of Lake Lanao, less than 40 kilometres fr om Marawi City, the capital of Lanao del Sur. They attacked troops from the Joint Task Force Ranao, injuring six before escaping by boat. The attack was the first c lash since the Marawi battle and may foreshadow more trouble in the Philippines. More to Come? Videos of the Marawi attacks continue to be circula ted online and the Maute brothers have been glorified as heroes by Filipino IS suppor ters. Up till their current strategic retreat, IS-affiliated militants continued to claim victory. In real terms, the Maute Group and their allies failed to capture Marawi and conve rt it into an outpost of Abu Bakr al- Baghdadi\u2019s so-called caliphate. However, they managed to turn the narrative into a rallying call and a model for regional militants to emulate. For instance, they n ow know how infiltrating cities and setting up defences in advance will give them the t actical advantage. Having held the military off for months, the Maute Group captured t he attention of global IS-affiliated militants who were then directed to migrate to the Philippines. Two days later, on 22 January, a Spanish national A bdelhakim Labidi Adib was arrested in Basilan, adding to the foreign terroris t numbers in southern Philippines. In the drawn-out battle, the Maute Group also systemat ically looted millions of dollars from homes, banks and shops, which they used for re cruitment and replenishment of their capabilities. According to estimates by the military, they could be expected to conduct renewed attacks. This is probably the reason why a former A bu Sayyaf Group (ASG) member considers the Marawi battle an ostensible success f or IS-affiliated militants in the Philippines. The Marawi Counter-Narrative The so-called success claims of the militants need not ring true, however. Having witnessed the destruction of one of many important cities in the island group of Mindanao, local government officials and residents are supportive of military operations to wipe out the remaining IS-affiliated militants. The manner in which the Maute Group and its allies conducted their failed attempt to capture Marawi clearly showed that they were never interested in the needs of a people who have been yearning for proper governance and economic development for decades. The aftermath of giving such groups th e space to operate is unbearable \u2013 social disintegration among groups who have lived together peaceably, destruction of critical infrastructure, loss of property and bu siness, hunger, disease and death. With peaceful Mindanao residents supporting intensi fied military offensives against the militants, the Armed Forces of the Philippines\u2019 Western Mindanao Command (Westmincom) claim that they are making great strid es in diminishing the capabilities of IS-affiliated ASG in Sulu, Basilan and Tawi-Tawi provinces. Since the operations began last year, 128 ASG membe rs were killed, 80 were arrested and 150 others have surrendered. Notably, Westminco m has managed to achieve strategic control of the Sulu and Tawi-Tawi waters within the Tri-Border Area (TBA) of the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia, preventing high-profile kidnappings-for- ransom that have plagued the TBA since 2000 and was the source of funding for ASG. The regional government of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) has also been working with local Islamic scholars t o rehabilitate militants who have surrendered, and funded infrastructure and economic development to encourage them to give up their firearms. Together with military p ressure, these programmes are expected to be the beginning of the end of the ASG. Such programmes \u2013 as well as the Bangsamoro Basic L aw (BBL) that is expected to be passed this year \u2013 are, however, also propaganda fodder for radicalisation. These peace initiatives have been framed as anti-Islam an d Muslims who are supportive of peace are labelled as traitors and could be targete d by terrorists to garner support through fear. There is also the possibility of peac e programmes falling apart and leading to violence if they are seen to benefit cer tain ethnic groups or families more than others. Far from Over If Westmincom\u2019s strategy in Mindanao is not followe d through, there is still the possibility that another Marawi-esque battle may ha ppen. Intelligence reports have maintained that leaders of the IS-affiliated milita nts \u2013 Amin Baco, Muawiyah, and Abu Turaifie \u2013 are still alive, despite earlier suggest ions that Amin Baco could be dead. With millions of dollars in loot still unrec overed and being used for recruitment, the IS-affiliated militants are re-organising their next move. New IS-affiliated cells reportedly continue to emerge in Jolo, Cotabato and Basilan. In addition, it was recently revealed on social med ia that there is a female unit comprising local women and those from other parts o f the Philippines who have been radicalised online. The unit is said to have been f ighting alongside the male IS- affiliated counterparts, led by a female, possibly from Manila. The militant scene in Mindanao has historically bee n observed to be male-dominant. If IS has been including females in the frontlines, the military should reconsider the roles that females may have been playing and factor it into their strategy. The above revelation is part of the trend of online radicalisation of Filipino Muslims in other parts of the Philippines as well as the large r diaspora. In the past few months, new social media groups have emerged, bringing toge ther radicalised Filipino Muslims who live in Manila, Basilan and Mindanao, as well a s Morocco, the Netherlands, Germany, South Korea, China and the United States. Individuals from the diaspora who have been radical ised online should not be taken for granted. Marawi veterans who have managed to su rvive would likely be in contact with this vast network for recruitment and funding purposes. ",

    "context": "Commentary ON 29 DECEMBER 2017, a video surfaced on a website known to be associated with the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and Syria or ISIS, called Khayr Wilayah Media. Eight minutes long, the clip \u2013 in Arabic and English \u2013 featured footage of ISIS attacks in Paris and Nice, interspersing these with scenes from Middle Eastern conflict zones as well as festivities in Western capitals su ch as Sydney and New York City. The video also included a segment in which the know n Singaporean ISIS militant Megat Shahdan Abdul Samad, also known as Abu Uqayl, led two other Southeast Asian-looking ISIS fighters in executing three knee ling Arab-looking prisoners, with gunshots at point blank range. Before carrying out the cold-blooded shootings, Abu Uqayl addressed the camera in English, urging ISIS supporters to kill all \u201cunbelievers\u201d and \u201capostates\u201d from East Asia to the west of Afric a. Some Broad Observations The video clip has garnered much attention on socia l media, prompting the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) to condemn th e clip, asserting that it represented a \u201cdesperate attack\u201d by ISIS to drive a wedge between Muslims and non- Muslims. A few broad observations about this latest clip appear pertinent: First , with Abu Uqayl\u2019s videotaped killing of an unarmed prisoner, a certain psychological and symbolic barrier has been crossed . He had killed a man in cold blood for what he believed to be a righteous religi ous cause and recorded it for all to see. His criminal act along with many other such at rocities by ISIS in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere, underscores the susceptibility of some i ndividuals to violent religious fanaticism. The danger of such acts is that they could inspire impressionable and disaffected individuals to carry out copy-cat attacks. As MUIS warned, such \u201cvideos prey on the minds of the weak, or those who do not have proper religious guidance\u201d. In September 2014, the Australian police thwarted plans by young supporters of ISIS in Sydney to carry out videotaped beheadings \u2013 \u201cdemonstration ki llings\u201d -- of random members of the public, similar to what ISIS was doing at the s ame time in Iraq and Syria with captured enemies. Second , the tactical bar for staging violent attacks has been lowered as well. ISIS propaganda for some time now has called for what ha s been termed the \u201cweaponisation of everyday life\u201d. In other words, i nstead of getting hold of firearms or learning how to make improvised explosives from the Internet, all that is needed to wreak havoc in densely populated cities like New Yo rk, Barcelona, London and for that matter Singapore, are everyday items like cars , trucks and knives. It is worth noting in this regard that in the same clip featuring Uqayl, another Malaysian militant identified as Muhammad Aqif Heusen Rahizat , assured supporters that if they cannot make it to Syria to join ISIS Central, they could do so in their respective countries. The clarion call to would-be lone wolves could not be clearer: carry out attacks wherever you are. East Asia Still A Target Third , Abu Uqayl\u2019s injunction to kill \u201cunbelievers\u201d and \u201capostates\u201d from East Asia to Africa are most telling. It affirms that despite th e defeat of ISIS-backed militant groups seeking to carve out a territorial base in Marawi C ity in Mindanao last October, ISIS Central still identifies \u201cEast Asia\u201d as an area whe re they want to establish a wilayat or regional province. Furthermore, Uqayl\u2019s violent exhortation suggests h is deep indoctrination in the virulent, skewed ISIS interpretation of Islamic tex ts to justify extreme violence. This is a complex issue, but suffice to say that ISIS basic ally emphasises the so-called \u201csword verses\u201d of the Quran, totally ignoring other passag es and traditions that counterbalance the former and provide a more textur ed and nuanced understanding of the faith. Finally , Uqayl and ISIS\u2019 use of terms such as \u201c kuffar \u201d (or \u201c kafir \u201d - unbeliever) and \u201cmurtadin \u201d (apostate) in the context of extremist propaganda speaks to the dehumanising effects of indoctrination in violent e xtremist ideology. Social psychological literature is replete with warnings t hat linguistic dehumanisation is a slippery slope that, in conjunction with political, social, economic and ideological factors, can pave the way towards out-group violenc e. The dehumanising of out-groups \u2013 before extremist i deology even enters the picture - can occur imperceptibly through the spread of exces sively puritanical interpretations of a religion. Overly puritanical interpretations of Islam - or an y other faith for that matter - that entrenches a dehumanising mindset towards other gro ups, may well \u201csoften up\u201d impressionable individuals to the violent extremist ideologies of the likes of ISIS and produce more Abu Uqayls. Implications In sum, the latest video clip suggests two major im plications as we begin the new year. First, continued public vigilance, as the ongoing S G Secure campaign seeks to promote, remains important in view of the threat of lone wolf attacks. Second, countering the content and dissemination of ISIS extremist ideology should continue apace, accompanied by parallel efforts by religious leaders to strengthen wider interpretations of the faith that eschew star k, us-versus-them categorical thinking. These include emphasising respect for not just co-religionists but all humanity, as equally enjoined by the faith. As MUIS rightly observed, Islam contains within its rich heritage intellectual resources that amply recognise \u201cthe sanctity of human life\u201d. Rediscovering and reasserting this aspect of the faith\u2019s proud heritage \u2013 through, for instance, deeper theological excavation of the longstanding, tolerant traditions espoused within Islam, and widely practised in the Southeast Asian region -- seems an increasingly pertinent task.

    "context": "COMMENTARY ON 2 JUNE 2021, President Xi Jinping told senior Communist Party officials to expand China\u2019s circle of friends and stressed the importance of improving propaganda efforts. Beijing seems to have finally realised that its image and credibility in the region and beyond have reached rock bottom. Numerous books and articles in the past had touched on Chinese soft power and growing sophistication of its diplomacy; from Africa to Europe to Latin America, China\u2019s prestige and influence was expanding. However, in recent years, publications on Chinese soft power have virtually declined. While the People\u2019s Republic of China has always had its share of critics, many Western media outlets were and remain biased towards it. The key factor behind the decline in China\u2019s soft power is to be found partly in Be ijing. Alarming Neighbours China\u2019s image in the Southeast Asian region \u2500 its immediate neighbourhood \u2500 has weakened in recent years. China has territorial disputes with four of the 10 ASEAN countries, Brunei, Malaysia, Philippines and Vietnam while tens ions with Indonesia, a non-claimant, have also risen due to overlapping economic zones. The Chinese navy and coast guard have engaged in numerous confrontations with the Southeast Asian claimants and built several artificial islands to assert Beijing\u2019s claims. Beijing\u2019s strong -arm tactics have led to ASEAN countries closing ranks with a common position on the South China Sea. China\u2019s relations with Japan and India have reached their lowest point in decades. In Europe public opinion on China has also wor sened. While a BBC poll in 2010 concluded that China was on balance seen positively by 15 countries, Beijing is now viewed more with suspicion. In a 2020 survey covering 13 European nations conducted by a group of 14 research entities that included Chatham House and the Central European Institute for Asian Studies (CEIAS), China\u2019s approval rating was at an historic low. Overall, views of China are predominantly negative. Factors contributing to this shift included China\u2019s confrontational diplomacy and the human rights situation. On the other hand, Russia has the most positive view of China. While Germany and several other EU members have imposed tariffs on various Chinese products and demanded that China open its markets, trade with China is perceived pre dominantly positively in most countries surveyed, except France, the UK and Sweden. Beijing, on its part, hoped that massive trade between China and the West would make it more receptive towards Beijing and Chinese policies. However, as the case of Austr alia shows, the US$257 billion in two -way trade for the period 2019 -2020 accounting for 29 percent of Australia\u2019s foreign trade has not stopped the two nations from plunging into a trade war. The COVID -19 pandemic and controversial allegations that China w as not honest in disclosing the virus\u2019 origin was probably one of the worst disasters for Chinese soft power since the Mao era. Eroding Soft Power There is little argument that China\u2019s image is not in a good shape in many parts of the world. Can Beijing reverse this? While this will be hard, it is, however, not impossible. China\u2019s image took on a positive trajectory after it reformed from a Maoist state spreading revolution to joining the mainstream global economy and eventually becoming a darling dest ination for foreign investors due to its huge markets. While times are much different now, Beijing can still regain its claim of pursuing a peaceful rise. In 2002 China and ASEAN signed the Declaration of Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC). After some years, China and the ASEAN countries agreed to upgrade the DOC to a Code of Conduct (COC), which is due to be signed in 2021. If China was to reduce its expansionist activities in the South China Sea, this could lead to a substantial easing of tensions between China and ASEAN. This in turn will have a positive knock -on effect on relations with other powers with interests in the region such as the US, Japan and Australia. Greater transparency on the part of Chinese companies and the opening o f more sectors of the Chinese economy to EU investees could go a long way at reducing tensions. As a German diplomat told the author: \u201cThe Chinese complain when we restrict Huawei in Europe. However, in China all telecommunications are run by the state.\u201d While the COVID -19 pandemic has somewhat dented China\u2019s image, its massive donations of vaccines, ventilators and protective gear have improved it in some parts of the world. Will a powerful China be willing to find a negotiated solution? Will it open more sectors of its economy to foreign investment? While only time will tell, one thing is certain: It will be easier for China to prosper with friends around it not enemies. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY The world is currently experiencing an unprecedented global food crisis, with 345.2 million people projected to face hunger in 2023. To alleviate this problem and feed a growing global population, more food must be produced. However, climate change, ecological degradation, and various political factors continue to challenge global agricultural production and the supply of food to needy populations. Furthermore, the over -use and inefficient uses of chemical fertilisers and pesticides have contributed to carbon emissions and resource degradation, thus undermining the long -term sustainability of food systems. Emerging technologies can help to address these concerns while als o supporting food security efforts. But their application and extent are jeopardised by the ongoing geopolitical tensions between the big powers. The Competition in Emerging Technologies Artificial Intelligence (AI), Autonomous Systems (AS) and biotechnol ogies have the potential to revolutionise food production by enabling more efficient data analyses, increasing yield potential, streamlining production processes, and producing novel food such as cultured meat. The US, home to many of the world's leading tech companies and research institutions, is a leader in AI research and development. Although it was, together with Western European countries like the Netherlands and Germany, pioneers in \u2018smart farming\u2019 using \u2018Internet -of-Things\u2019 (IoT) systems, China a nd other Asian countries such as Japan and South Korea, have caught up. In particular, China has emerged as one of the global leaders in AI, with the central government investing heavily in the technology as part of its broader national development plan. C hinese companies and farmers are not only innovating IoT applications, but also the component technologies such as \u2018intelligent\u2019 drones which sense, analyse, and take intervening action. Regarding biotechnologies, the US is a global powerhouse in develop ing and commercialising agribiotech. Many of the world's largest biotech companies such as Bayer (formerly Monsanto) and Corteva (formerly DuPont), have their origins in the US, with the government having been a strong supporter. However, China is catchi ng up fast. Aside from investments in crop biotech and \u2018novel future foods\u2019 (like cultured meat), Chinese state -owned enterprises are acquiring foreign agribusinesses. Chinese researchers have also made significant strides, such as in discovering how to pr oduce an animal feed protein from carbon monoxide , which could reduce China\u2019s reliance on imported soybeans . The China -US Tech War The ongoing China -US tech war and related trade frictions, geostrategic rivalry, and technological contestation are threatening the development of agricultural biotech. Trade frictions and technological contests between the two countries have existed since 2017, with the US -China trade war starting in 2018 under then -US president Donald Trump. Bilateral relations have not improved much under the administration of US President Joe Biden. Having already introduced sweeping export controls on AI and semicon ductor technologies, the US is now looking to impose controls on other emerging technologies such as biotechnologies . In response, China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Science and Technology recently announced that they are seeking public comment regarding proposed changes to the catalogue of technologies restricted for export. The export ban list is a warning to other countries looking to follow the US such as Japan and the Netherlands. Accel erating Technology Development Amid the great tech rivalry between the US and China, both countries have increased investments in several tech fields to drive innovation in agritech to create more efficient and sustainable agricultural practices, and also potentially to improve global food security. Washington is using a whole -of-governm ent approach to advance biotechnology in agriculture and supply chain resilience to boost agricultural production and create climate -smart incentives. Likewise, Beijing is elevating agribiotech development to a national priority under its seed revitalisati on plan. Furthermore, as China and the US compete to establish themselves as leaders in agritech, they may collaborate with other nations through various initiatives or share their technologies with other countries. This could result in the adoption of more advanced agricultural practices worldwide, while also improving overall food production and security. Nevertheless, the potential risks may outweigh any positives. Persistent US efforts to choke off China\u2019s access to chips and other advanced technologies, along with China\u2019s responses, hinder global efforts to achieve sustainable agricultural development. Agritech weaponisation is undesirable f or all countries. Implications for Food Security For China, this raises questions about the country\u2019s food security ambitions. As the country\u2019s rapid agribiotech development is partly due to strong collaboration (such as in technology transfers) with cou ntries like the US, the agritech export restrictions threaten Beijing\u2019s food security targets. In r esponse, Beijing aims to develop domestic agribiotechnology to boost domestic food production. Globally, as China and the US are among the world\u2019s leading agricultural producers and traders, the tech wars will inevitably affect domestic food production, exports, and agricultural trade patterns, while simultaneously reshaping global food supply chains. Other countries may be forced to choose between the US and China to secure agritech and agricultural imports. This situation leads to questions about the future of global food governance. In an era of great power competition, both the US and China aim to impose their standards worldwide. The increasing Chinese prowess in technologies may result in Beijing playing a greater role in global science, agricultur e, and technology governance. Lastly, the potential inclusion of agritech in the tech war could impact Asia\u2019s food security. The tech war\u2019s indirect impact on global import and export of food (such as animal products, grains, and edible oils) could make it challenging for Asian countries to secure key technologies needed to feed their hungry and growing populations. But Asian countries may also seek to extract advantages from the US and China, while committing to neither unless circumstances force them to make a choice. Looking Ahead The implications of the tech war extending into agritech raises questions about the ethics of the war. Given the worsening global food crisis and interlinked issues like malnutrition and hunger, shouldn\u2019t the US and China pl ace ethical standards above geopolitics and geostrategic rivalries by continuing to export agritech and agricultural products? Not doing so may contribute to a worsening global food crisis. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY THE United Nations Review Conference of the Non -Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 2022 did not produce a con sensus document because Russia did not agree with the texts related to the occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) in Ukraine. Such is the weight of the matter that discussions on a treaty concerning nuclear weapons non - proliferation and disarmamen t had reached a stalemate, all because of the safety of a civilian nuclear facility. Over the last year, officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) had been allowed onsite to monitor the safe operation of the Zaporizhzhia NPP. Although the agency expended enormous resources on the NPP, any compromise of its structural integrity owing to shelling by the warring forces could have resulted in a consequence far greater than the Chernobyl radioactive fallout in 1986. Even though the reactors ha d been shut down, the NPP still remained a sitting -duck in the conflict zone. The Zaporizhzhia NPP episode has highlighted how civilian NPPs can become centres of gravity during a war, and this has enormous implications for the design and reinforcement of NPPs going forward. Going Underground for Protection Nuclear reactors around the world are built above ground and housed in a fortified containment building. In the US, the Defence -In-Depth safety philosophy, which aims to prevent and mitigate accidents th rough overlapping layers of protection, ensure that such buildings have been designed to withstand the impact of an aircraft crash. In 1988, Sandia National Laboratories carried out component testing that showed a containment building withstanding the impa ct of an F -4 fighter jet crash.  Following the 9/11 attack, computer simulations also concluded that containment buildings in the US can withstand the crash of a Boeing 767 commercial aircraft. However, the impact of missiles are different from that of ai r crashes. Firstly, the structural integrity of the nuclear facility would have already been weakened by artillery barrages during a battle. Furthermore, the pressure exerted on the NPP will be much greater given the higher velocity of advanced projectiles comprising sharper shaped charges. An NPP target will succumb to the penetrative and explosive effects of these missiles. Although it is a war crime to attack a nuclear facility, international instruments and laws are inadequate to prevent attacks arisin g from miscalculations. The reality, therefore, is that NPPs built above ground are vulnerable in a war, and the only way to reduce the risk of NPPs being attacked is to build the reactors underground. An underground reactor not only possesses superior p rotection in times of war, but it also has a smaller footprint, which is a huge factor in winning public acceptance. The advent of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) will also offer more flexibility for these underground reactors to be sited in or closer to cit y centres. For densely populated countries like Singapore, it will certainly be a major policy consideration to have reactors built underground \u2013 both in consideration of nuclear safety as well as physical security. Challenges in Emergency Response Building reactors underground is however a \u201cdouble -edged sword\u201d. While it offers better protection, the nature of it is such that access to the reactors would be more challenging in an emergency. For example, during the Fukushima nuclear disaster in March 2011, the reactors were doused with seawater as a last resort to cool the reactor cores and prevent them from a complete meltdown. Had the reactors been built underground, it would have been more challenging to pump seawater into the reactors\u2019 ve ssels. Evacuating personnel from an underground reactor during an emergency will also be a challenge. Emergency plans for evacuation would need to be meticulously drawn up and rigorously exercised. The easy access to and exit from an underground reactor during an emergency has to be balanced against the requirement for fortified security. Currently, there are no IAEA guidelines on emergency responses for underground reactors. Vendors developing such reactors will need to convince th eir regulators that not only will the entire plant remain safe during operation, but the safety of the operators are also assured. Building such a reactor is not simply about assembling a conventional SMR in the factory and placing it underground. An integ ration of safety, security and safeguards (termed the 3Ss) has to be embedded into the design philosophy. NuScale Power Corporation has done several iterations of design and component testing to qualify for the US National Regulatory Commission (NRC) lice nce to develop an SMR that will be sited underground. The growing preference for smaller reactors could reduce costs as having them underground could be cheaper than having them in containment buildings. Hence, we could potentially see other vendors ventur ing into the domain of underground reactors. The Way Forward The demand for underground reactors will increase, not only because they will be less vulnerable during a war. An underground design is also more robust against earthquakes or tsunamis. The fac t that an underground nuclear reactor will not be in the public eye could greatly ameliorate the Not -In-My-Backyard (NIMBY) syndrome. In Singapore, the population, being well -educated, will have no doubts about the role nuclear energy plays in combating global climate change. In 2008, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew had said that nuclear energy was the solution to Singapore\u2019s energy security and climate change issues. With advances in nuclear safety technology, it is technically feasible for Singapore t o build an NPP. The NIMBY syndrome will be easier to address if the reactor is built underground. With new safety technologies and the feasibility of building nuclear reactors underground, the time has come for countries in Southeast Asia to curb their ca rbon emissions by adopting nuclear energy. The region has deliberated on the issue for far too long, and our climate clock is ticking away.  What is needed are vendors with a proven SMR design, which is licensed by a credible regulator and is ready to be deployed. The entry barrier to this niche nuclear industry is very high as the safety of populations and the environment cannot be compromised. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Sec urity (WPS) calls on the international community to incorporate gender perspectives in frameworks analysing international security issues. There is growing debate on the relationship between climate security and women that is merging with existing literatu re on women and armed conflict. An understanding of women\u2019s vulnerabilities in climate change is essential to understanding the magnitude and urgency of the issue and should be investigated and addressed as an integral part of ASEAN\u2019s climate security ar chitecture. ASEAN could pursue this through its WPS Regional Plan of Action (RPA). Women and Climate Change The UN has already begun to broach the intersection between climate change, and women and security , arguing the connection between resource scarcity and violent conflicts and proposing the strengthening of women\u2019s networks to engage in dialogue and mediation pr ocesses around natural resources management. The effects of climate change have broad gendered implications due to the entrenched inequalities women face in accessing and managing key resources such as water, food and energy. In understanding women\u2019s role in climate change, it is essential to understand their role in making decisions about natural resources and how these decisions manifest regionally. Take the water sector for example. Successful and effective water projects are vital in a new climate real ity. There is evidence that water projects designed and run with the inclusion of women to the maximum extent possible are more likely to succeed in the long term. However, the reality is that women across Asia and the Pacific lack representation at the management level in the water sector. The argument for more active participation by women in discussions on climate change and food security is borne out by the 2021 OECD report , which stated that over a quarter of the female labour force in Southeas t Asia worked in the agriculture industry and in food production.  And, according to the Asia-Pacific Forum on Sustainabl e Development held in March 2022, 48 -75 per cent of employed women worked in the agriculture and agricultural value chains in Cambodia, Myanmar, Lao PDR and Vietnam. Women are also under -represented in the energy sector in Southeast Asia. This under -representation is partly due to sociocultural norms , which limit the presence of women in employment and hence impeding the move towards a gender -just energy transition. It is this author\u2019s assessment that policymaking should include the participation of women and should cover all levels \u2013 from grassroot s to corporations \u2013 to ensure equitable decision -making on vital resources. We have to recontextualise our understanding of security and climate change to include gendered understandings of adaptation to and mitigation of the impacts of climate change. By not integrating gender analysis into every level of security discourse, climate security policies will continue to miss the crucial inputs of women in analysing the catalysts of social fractures, like increasing gender and class divisions, and discriminat ion, as well as seizing opportunities for innovative adaptation and mitigation strategies. WPS Regional Plan of Action in ASEAN The WPS RPA is a result of decade s of political engagement in the ASEAN region as expressed by the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women in the ASEAN Region (2004), and the ASEAN Regional Plan of Action on the Elimination of Violence against Women (2015). ASEAN leader s also adopted the Joint Statement on Promoting WPS in the region in 2017. In addition, the ASEAN Ministerial Dialogue on Strengthening Women\u2019s Role for Sustainable Peace and Security in 2020 further drove the integration of WPS across the three ASEAN comm unity pillars, which are: Political -Security Community, Economic Community and Socio -Cultural Community. The ASEAN WPS RPA, launched in December 2022, is the latest regional effort to further acknowledge and increase sensitivity to women\u2019s role in confli ct prevention and peacebuilding. While we applaud the launch of a regional plan on WPS in ASEAN, we should not lose sight of this opportunity to make the agenda work for the region by including new threats, such as climate change. Adopting ASEAN\u2019s own ver sion of a WPS RPA independently without emulating RPAs from elsewhere, most of which focus on the threat of armed conflict, would go a long way to ensure the success of the agenda here. I take my cue from the growing global conversations on WPS and climate security. Acknowledging the threats of climate change facing women is a start, especially in vital areas of economic, food, water, energy, and health securities, as well as complex emergencies that result from natural hazards and human insecurities. All of these will only be exacerbated by climate change. One way of addressing these concerns in an inclusive manner would be through the integration of the four WPS pillars, i.e., protection, prevention, participation and women\u2019s active role in relief and r ecovery, as essential parts of the existing climate security architecture, and not to see women as an area of \u2018special interest\u2019; subjective and analysed outside of existing climate adaptation and mitigation frameworks. Beyond ASEAN Community 2025 In pla nning to move beyond the ASEAN Community 2025 agenda, existing regional frameworks should look to merging concerns for a better appreciation of threats to different groups of people. One such merger should be that between frameworks that address violence a gainst women and gender inequality, and those that address climate change. Policymakers will need to adopt cross -cutting approaches to incorporate gender into their areas of expertise to mutually feed into their policy gaps. In this way, ASEAN will fully utilise and strengthen existing frameworks to address concerns around gender equality, climate security, and peace in the region. This would help to identify policy blind spots that might compromise the effectiveness and reach of climate change policies. This is also a good way to maximise the advantages of having an ASEAN WPS RPA. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY WHILE DEVELOPED countries are trying to re -open borders to resume global activities, developing countries are still struggling to control their fatality rates due to unavailability of vaccines. What are the successes and challenges one co uld learn from the United States, where more than 40 million people have been infected so far, with more than 650,000 deaths? Successes Vaccine development : The US vaccines approved to date either as fully authorised or for emergency use only are Pfizer -BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. Both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are based on m -RNA which teaches the immune system to prevent infection from the COVID -19. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine teaches the immune system to attack the protein that causes the COVID -19 to infect other cells. Normally, vaccine development takes a long time -- about 10 -15 years. Pfizer and Moderna were able to use old technology for new applications, by leveraging on the m-RNA research taken a few decades ago to develop the COVID -19 vaccine. Government support : At the onset of the pandemic, the Trump administration was able to speed up the logistics to design, build and distribute ventilators and personal protection equipment to reduce the death rate of COVID -19 patients. It also pumped in money to invest and/or to order in advance a number of vaccines being developed such that if and when it worked, vaccines could be produced in a short time and in large quantities for the US. As Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were approved for emergency use only in January 2021, the Biden administration was successful in delivering the vaccines to the people. This requires coordinated efforts from the federal government and states to the local authorities to work out the most practical ways to vaccinate people from mass vaccination sites, hospitals, pharmacies and so on. It was so successful such that by the beginning of summer 2021 the US had one of the highest vaccination rates worldwide only behind Israel and the United Kingdom. Challen ges Follow the science or not : COVID -19 vaccines protect people from getting infected, severely ill, and significantly reduce the death rate. However, since vaccines are not 100% effective at preventing infection, fully vaccinated people could still get C OVID - 19, but are less likely to develop serious illness than those who are unvaccinated. Even with the abundance of vaccines in the US, unfortunately, as of now only 176 million people or 53.6% of the population is fully vaccinated. It means approximatel y 90 million are eligible but decided not to. This provides a breeding ground for the virus to potentially mutate to become new variants. The new variant could be benign or become more contagious and virulent. The infection and death rates have been incre asing since the middle of June 2021. This creates problems for patients who need hospitalisation especially the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). In some states, most of the ICU beds are occupied by the unvaccinated COVID -19 patients thus denying those with other critical diseases. Freedom and individualism : Whether people agree that public safety should have a higher priority than individual rights or not, in the US, individual freedom has always been one of the country\u2019s key foundations. It allows activities t hat people in other countries find hard to understand. For instance in Texas one can carry a handgun without a permit or in New Hampshire one can ride a motorcycle without a helmet where the state official motto is \u201cLive Free or Die\u201d. Because of this cul ture of freedom, it is very difficult if not possible to mandate, enforce vaccination or mask wearing in public. The legal system is complex where the local authority can challenge the state and the state can challenge the federal government. Misinformati on: This is a very serious problem in the US as it creates mistrust. It is very difficult to control misinformation, especially from politicians, public figures, media networks, who are out to serve their own interests. There is a lot of totally incorrect information about the disease prevention and treatment of COVID -19, therefore reducing the effectiveness of the pandemic management. Politics : It is undeniable that US politics play a very critical part in addressing the COVID -19 pandemic, with voters dee ply polarised. The Democratic Party followers tend to favour mask wearing and vaccination; the Republican Party followers tend to play down the seriousness of the COVID -19. Incentives : Even with monetary rewards and other incentives, the vaccination rate only achieved a moderate success since those they try to persuade have already been vaccinated. Learning to Live with COVID -19 Since no single country can solve the pandemic, the Biden administration has restored the US\u2019 relationship with the World Heal th Organisation (WHO) so as to coordinate a global response to the pandemic. It also contributed US$4 billion to COVAX, the vaccine alliance whose mission is to distribute COVID -19 vaccines to low - and middle - income countries. By August 2021 the US has s hipped 110 million COVID -19 vaccine doses to 65 countries with no strings attached. The US has expanded the number of Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\u2019s regional offices to gain first -hand knowledge, including an office in Hanoi in August 2 021 to cover Southeast Asia. The Biden administration is pushing for future preparedness in dealing with potential pandemic with a $65 billion proposal in September 2021 to accelerate vaccine development, testing, production, and early warning systems. What Next: Lessons to Be Learned In monitoring what happens in the US, one could draw some lessons: \u2022 old technology could have new applications; \u2022 vaccine distribution is a hands -on operation that involves all parties; \u2022 misinformation creates mistrust which must be controlled to have an effective pandemic management; \u2022 trust is very critical and that is the main reason why the US has so many unvaccinated people; \u2022 achieving global vaccination as quickly as possible is important since the more contagiou s variant could originate from anywhere such as the Delta variant from India and the Gamma variant from Brazil; \u2022 early warning is critical to minimise the virus spreading early. The flu virus keeps on mutating and it seems that people now have accepted i t as a fact of life to have a flu shot annually. The WHO estimates that annually one billion people worldwide get the flu and 290,000 to 650,000 die. Almost certainly, the COVID -19 will not go away. What are the number of deaths from COVID -19 that people can accept in order to carry on with normal life? Nobody knows and it depends on the risk level that people are willing to accept. The threshold varies from country to country where it is influenced by factors such as ethnicity, culture, politics, religio n, and background. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY Under President Xi Jinping\u2019s leadership, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has become increasingly assertive in efforts to control neighboring maritime territories. In the Taiwan Strait, as well as in the East and South China Seas, Chinese military and quasi -military forces have repeatedly engaged in brinkmanship against the navies, coast guards and mi litary aircraft of the US and other nations. Hawkish and Dovish Options for Dealing with China The Obama, Trump and Biden administrations have responded to China\u2019s expansionist activities by adopting an increasingly hardline policy towards Beijing. Most notably, they have boosted US military deployments to the region, established new multilateral secur ity partnerships, such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (or QUAD) and AUKUS , and restricted high -technology exports to the PRC. Several foreign policy commentators have either endorsed this policy shift or lamented that it is not tough enough. The cornerst one of an even more hawkish US policy would be significantly expanded military deployments and commitments throughout the region, including the extension of a formal security guarantee to Taiwan. By contrast, some analysts have argued that a less confront ational policy towards China is preferable to avert war and address transnational threats such as climate change. The centrepiece of a more dovish policy would be the cession to China of a sphere of influence (i.e., military preponderance) over Taiwan and the South and East China Seas. Washington\u2019s Credibility Problem Unfortunately, a serious credibility problem afflicts both the hawkish and dovish approaches, which undermines their likely effectiveness. The hawkish option lacks credibility because the o utcome of China\u2019s territorial disputes matters far more to China than to the United States. For the PRC, those disputes are transpiring in adjacent geographical areas that constitute vital strategic and economic interests, and significantly impact its nati onal sovereignty. On the other hand, the United States is an ocean away, and many Americans may not view Taiwan and the South and East China Seas as vital interests. This disparity is critical because scholarly research has shown that the outcomes of crises and wars often favour the side that has more at stake in the confrontation, not the side that is more powerful. In the last half century, the US superpower has itself lost large -scale wars against far weaker but more determined adversaries in Vietnam and Afghanistan. Since Taiwan and the South and East China Seas are ultimately less important to the United States than to China, doves argue that it would be geopolitically prudent for America to cede them to China\u2019s sphere of influence. Notwithstanding the rhetorical scorn which generations of US policymakers have heaped on the concept, spheres of influence have long served as a critical tool for promoting peace between great power adversaries. Unfortunately, this option also entails a serious credibility problem for the United States. This is because granting China a sphere of influence would inevitably spark widespread alarm ab out the reliability of US commitments to the defence of its regional allies. This strategic concern would be particularly intense for two reasons. First, among the states that are contesting China\u2019s maritime claims are Japan and the Philippines, which als o happen to be lynchpins of the US alliance network in the region. Consequently, if the United States permits China to seize the contested territories, this will signal that Washington is also unwilling to oppose Chinese aggression against the Japanese and Philippine home islands. Second, although the United States is no longer formally allied to Taiwan, the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act commits Washington to provide the island with de fence assistance and to \u201cmaintain the capacity\u2026to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion [against Taiwan].\u201d Also, three of the last four presidents \u2013 Bush, Trump and Biden \u2013 have either declared or strongly insinuated that they would come to Taiwan\u2019s defence if it were to be attacked by the PRC. Given the intense bipartisan anti-China mood in US politics today, it is almost inconceivable that the Biden administration would abandon Taiwan \u2013 an economically thriving liberal democracy \u2013 to the depredations of the PRC. Averting the Worst -Case Scenarios The United States can mitigate the credibility problems associated with both the hawkish and dovish strat egies by navigating a middle course between them. Such a policy would seek to raise the costs of further Chinese expansionism in the South and East China Seas and Taiwan Strait through \u201c soft balancing \u201d, or the coordinated employment of non -military tools of coercive statecraft, including diplomatic ostracism and economic sanctions. This middle -ground policy would also enable Washington to continue providing Taiw an with robust military assistance. In recognition of the unfavourable balance of stakes for China, however, the United States would have to scrupulously refrain from direct military intervention against China in these geographic areas. Importantly, this prohibition means that the United States would not employ its military forces to defend the maritime claims of Japan and the Philippines. But it could reassure Tokyo and Manila of Washington\u2019s ironclad commitment to the security of their uncontested homela nds, however, by significantly bolstering its military presence in both countries . Although this approach would not appeal to diehard hawks or d oves, it might avoid the worst -case scenarios associated with their preferred policies. For hawks, it is that Washington stumbles into yet another exorbitant and inauspicious war of choice on the heels of Iraq and Afghanistan, though this time against a nu clear armed great power . For doves, it is that conciliatory initiatives aimed at forestalling such a war prompt disaffected US allies to bandwagon with C hina, thereby imperiling the regional balance of power. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY THE ELECTION of hardline cleric, Ebrahim Raisi, to the presidency of Iran has caused alarm in the West. It certainly poses major challenges but could also open opportunities for dealing with Iran more effectively. His rise to the top position streamlines the bifurcated authority between the unelected Supreme Leader and elected president in the Islamic Republic, as the two men will now preach from the same pulpit. Who is Ebrahim Raisi? Raisi has had a controversial past. He has been intimately associate d with the Islamic Republic since its inception in the wake of the 1978/79 Iranian revolution. That epochal event overthrew the Shah\u2019s pro -Western monarchy and enabled his chief political - religious opponent Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to establish his Isla mic order. Raisi bears the reputation of having been involved in the killing of thousands of political prisoners in 1978, which he claims was for the good of the Islamic Republic. Yet, he has also been an ardent follower of Khomeini\u2019s two -pronged appro ach to Iran\u2019s transformation: jihadi (ideological and combative) to Islamise state and society, and ijtihadi (reformative and pragmatic) to build a strong and defendable Islamic Republic, capable of resisting outside impositions and interventions. Khomei ni opposed the United States as the \u2018Great Satan\u2019 due to the superpower\u2019s past unsavoury involvement in Iran and ongoing hegemonic presence in the region. He called for resistance to the US, along with some of its regional allies (Israel in particular), no t only ideologically but also pragmatically whenever required. Instead, he urged his regime to look to the East, Soviet Russia, China and India, to counter the US, and showed no qualms over these powers\u2019 variance to his Shia Islamic disposition, despite having branded the USSR as a \u2018Lesser Satan\u2019. Reliving Khomeini\u2019s Jihadi -Ijtihadi Legacy? Khomeini died in 1989. His successor Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has followed his jihadi - ijtihadi legacy. Khamenei has used his enormous religious authority and constitut ional powers to be hardline on principles and flexible in tactics. For example, he backed the July 2015 multilateral Iran nuclear agreement \u2013 the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) \u2013 as an act of \u2018heroic flexibility\u2019 or pragmatism. Raisi embraces the same tradition. He has reached the top through the judiciary, devotion to Khomeini\u2019s concept of Velayat -e Faqih (rule of the Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist) and close links to Khamenei. Prior to running for the presidency and coming second to mo derate Hassan Rouhani in the 2017 election and then being appointed by Khamenei to the powerful position of Iran\u2019s Chief Justice, he was the custodian of the very wealthy Astan Quds Razavi Foundation (2016 -19). He was also in charge of administering Imam R eza\u2019s shrine in the city of Mashhad, where he concurrently presided over one of the best libraries and museums in Iran. As an author and researcher, I met Raisi a few years ago in Mashhad, a city of religious pilgrimage in northeast Iran. I found him to be hardline ideologically and distrustful of the US and its regional allies, but meanwhile very philosophical and engaging in discussing Iran\u2019s problems. Like Khamenei, he was sceptical of the US fully implementing the nuclear agreement. But he could also see th e need for ending the US sanctions and improving the living conditions of the Iranian people. He impressed me that, in tandem with Khamenei and many other conservative colleagues, including some in the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), he could be ijtihadi when the circumstances demanded. Hence his declaration of support as president -elect for the current Vienna negotiations to reach an agreement with the US over the JCPOA and for improving relations with regional Arab countries. Pragmatic Hardliner or Conservative Pragmatist? Raisi is unlikely to engage in any structural reforms that could rock the conservatives\u2019 hold on power or to show flexibility on Iranian national and regional security postures. But as Supreme Le ader, he is as much interested in the survival of the regime and therefore prone to pragmatic actions. A fundamental problem of the regime has been its bifurcation between the \u2018sovereignty of God\u2019, embodied in the Supreme Leader, and the \u2018sovereignty of people\u2019, reflected by the elected president. This has caused power struggles and policy confusion when someone from the ijtihadi side has been elected to the presidency, as in the case of Mohammad Khatami (1997 -2005) and the outgoing Hassan Rouhani. Raisi\u2019s election places just about all the top institutions of power under the conservatives\u2019 control, enabling them to focus on addressing domestic and foreign policy challenges without resistance from their reformist opponents. This does not provide a long -term solution to the Islamic Republic\u2019s ills but narrows the gap between the two lines of authorities for the time being. ",

    "context": "Commentary TO SAY that a Trump presidency is unlike that of hi s predecessor would be an egregious understatement. In fact, being different from his predecessor was exactly what he had prided himself to be, and what presumab ly appealed to voters who had become discontented with the US political establish ment. One way that President Trump has differed from Barack Obama is in his disd ain for news media and his preference for using social media to air his views. Mr Obama is often referred to as the \u2018first social- media president\u2019 given the burgeoning use of social media by the public at the time and h is administration\u2019s deft use of such platforms as public communication and engagement to ols. President Donald Trump has really made social media, specifically Twitter, a key tool in his engagement with the American public and the world. The Real Donald Trump on @realDonaldTrump With approximately 46.4 million followers on his @r ealDonaldTrump Twitter account, Mr Trump has continued to use his personal account, instead of the official @POTUS account (21.7 million followers), to air his views on a variety of issues including domestic policies, the role of the media, terrorism , and foreign policy. Mr Trump\u2019s tweets have been examined and analysed by numerous experts such as data analytics companies, the media, data scientists, and linguist s. Some of their findings demonstrate that not all twe ets by @realDonaldTrump are actually tweeted by Mr Trump himself (the use of la nguage, the time of the tweet, and even what kind of device it was tweeted from can he lp differentiate between Trump\u2019s own musings and his administration\u2019s writings). Con gratulatory tweets and tweets about announcements (i.e. \u2018official\u2019-sounding tweet s) tend to be written by his staff while the more emotionally-charged tweets are his o wn. Is It Truly \u2018America First\u2019? How do President Trump\u2019s tweets about policy relate to actual policy? It is unclear if his tweets are an accurate representation of his ad ministration\u2019s stance or if the tweets themselves have an impact on the policy-making proc ess even though the tweets are considered official government statements. For exam ple, the Washington Post did their own analysis on Mr Trump\u2019s tweets and US fore ign policy and noted that in 2017, his tweets repeatedly offended close US allies and made it difficult to understand what his administration\u2019s exact position on issues was. President Trump\u2019s foreign policy stance is encapsul ated in the phrase \u2018America First\u2019. His foreign policy style assumes a cynical and omin ous view that the world is out to \u2018cheat\u2019 America (e.g. foreigners stealing jobs, all ies free-riding on US commitment and security) and thus he aims to put American needs at the forefront and lessen the burden of global leadership. This has translated into tweets that are combative in tone (e.g. lashing out at Pakistan over US aid, calling Mexico and Canada \u2018difficult\u2019 over NAFTA negotiations) and led to plans to reduce US commitment in multilateral fo rums. Despite the aforementioned, has actual policy shifted? In Donald Trump\u2019s first year in office, has the US retreated from multilateralism? Between Twitter-speak and Actual Policy An examination of Mr Trump\u2019s tweets from 20 January 2017 (the day he was sworn into the Oval Office) to 17 January 2018, looking s pecifically at mentions of US commitment to multilateral institutions threw up so me interesting findings. Listed below is a table of the multilateral institution involved , the comments that he has made about the said institution on Twitter, and the actual pol icy that has been effected with regard to the said institution. Institution Twitter-speak Actual policy United Nations \u2018Great honour to have spoken before the countries of the world\u2019 Wants to reduce its financial commitments to the UN; Has taken credit for UN budget cuts NATO \u2018Told other nations they must pay more, not fair to US\u2019 US has reaffirmed commitment to NATO APEC \u2018\u2026Here to offer a renewed partnership with America\u2026\u2019 No change to status quo yet European Union \u2018The EU is very protectionist with the US. STOP!\u2019 No change to status quo yet * Trump has tweeted about other institutions like A SEAN but the tweets have been excluded from analysis as they were mere mentions of the term. * The database used for this analysis is www.trumptwitterarchive.com. The data suggests that despite his tweets and rheto ric, US engagement with multilateral institutions remains consistent. In th e case of the United Nations, while the US has sought to reduce its financial commitments t o the institution, Washington remains generally actively involved with the global body. In the case of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), the same holds true. While Mr Trump was highly critical of the security institution, calling it \u2018obsolete\u2019 and criticising NATO allies for not meeting their finan cial commitments to the alliance, the US remains committed and US military presence in Eu rope has not decreased. Likewise for other institutions such as the Europea n Union, despite what Mr Trump tweets, there has been no change to US policy and/o r involvement in these organisations. It is important to note, however, that despite his proclivity for Twitter, Mr Trump has mentioned multilateral forums infrequently in his t weets as the bulk of his tweets tend to focus on domestic issues or bilateral relations. While the lack of mention of multilateralism may in itself be taken as an indica tor of Mr Trump\u2019s shift away from it, his administration\u2019s continued work in the area sug gests otherwise. In all, the concerns surrounding an increasingly is olationist America wanting to shift away from multilateralism should ease. Despite Mr T rump\u2019s rhetoric and tweets, the US remains involved and committed to the various mu ltilateral institutions that it is a member of. ",

    "context": "Commentary SINGAPORE PRIME Minister Lee Hsien Loong inaugurate d the country\u2019s chairmanship of ASEAN for 2018 with the themes of r esilience and innovation. This is to promote innovation through the use of technology as well as collective resilience against terrorism, cybercrime, and climate change. This year\u2019s chairmanship will also focus on advancing the digital economy of ASEAN mem ber states to make the region globally competitive while achieving sustainable gr owth. Hence, it is necessary to know the opportunities th at digital innovation brings to the ASEAN economies. Roadblocks between ASEAN and the d igital economy must be identified as well to ensure effective policy formu lation. However, doing all these requires a critical understanding of the trends tha t shape today\u2019s digital economy. ASEAN\u2019s Digital Economy Where does ASEAN stand in the push for the digital economy today? ASEAN\u2019s strong regional economy, favourable demographics, and Info rmation and Communication (ICT) investments lead the region to become a poten tial global leader in the digital economy. Collectively, ASEAN is the sixth largest economy in the world, with a combined GDP of US$2.5 trillion. Its total population of some 62 8 million people represents 10 percent of the world. Moreover, 40 percent of its citizens are under 30 years of age, and 90 percent of them have access to the Internet. Studie s show that this group is technologically savvy who contributes significantly to the growth of the digital economy, using the Internet extensively for shoppin g, banking, booking hotels and hailing taxis. ASEAN\u2019s digital economy currently generates approxi mately $150 billion in revenues annually, according to a joint study by AT Kearney, a leading global management consulting firm, and Axiata, a Malaysian telecommun ication conglomerate. The largest share of revenue comes from connectivity and online services, each accounting for 35 up to 40 percent of overall revenues. They are followed by user interface (20 percent of revenues), which includes devices, software, and systems. Another component of revenue comes from content and enabling technologies, which constitute the remaini ng 10 percent. ICT investments also boosted the region\u2019s digital e conomy. According to the AT Kearney-Axiata study, ICT investment in the region has amounted to more than $100 billion in 2014, which grows at over 15 percent ann ually. However, much more should be done to address the di gital divide in the region. For example, Singapore is the only ASEAN member state i n the top 10 of the United Nations\u2019 ICT Index, and also the only ASEAN country that has been categorised as a \u201cStand out\u201d or possessing high digital development in Tufts University\u2019s Digital Evolution Index. Promoting a Dynamic Economy Promoting the digital economy will help the bloc\u2019s member-states propel their economic growth. Using the Internet will help entre preneurs to gain access to new markets as well as construct new businesses. Moreov er, according to the study, if ASEAN has successfully transformed itself into a gl obal digital powerhouse, it could potentially generate an additional $1 trillion in A SEAN\u2019s GDP by 2025. Interestingly, digital innovation is already presen t in ASEAN. For example, Singapore\u2019s Olam International, a conglomerate engaged in agri- business, has successfully promoted smart farming through the use of digital t echnology. The conglomerate\u2019s Olam Farmer Information System (OFIS), which regist ered more than 100,000 farmers in 21 countries in the system, serves as an online platform that provides a comprehensive view of operations in different farms . This technology is useful for analysing the collect ed data for mapping the exact location of farms, determining appropriate amount o f fertilisers, and identifying which types of shade trees should be planted for better c ocoa production. Digital technology also creates new industries such as mobile financial services, e- commerce, big data analytics, cybersecurity solutio ns, and transport services. The presence of ride-sharing services through mobile ap plications \u2014 Uber, Grab, and Go- Jek \u2014 illustrates how digitalisation reshapes trans port services in ASEAN. The widespread adoption of e-commerce and mobile financ ial services also boosted the growth of local business activities in the region. Developing smart cities through digital technology will also help ASEAN address the influx of people migrating into cities. It is proje cted that around 34.5 million people in the region will migrate into cities by 2025, which could intensify the problems of pollution and traffic congestion. Addressing the issues stemming from the growing urb an population requires the use of smart technology. Singapore\u2019s electronic road pr icing (ERP) system for managing traffic congestion is a case in point and can be us ed in other ASEAN member states. Accelerating Broadband Access Improving Internet access must be a top priority to address the gap between ASEAN countries. The AT Kearney-Axiata study showed that close to 417 million people in ASEAN do not have access to basic Internet services . Lack of access is more severe in CLMV (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam) count ries. For example, the OECD\u2019s Science, Technology and Inn ovation Outlook 2016 revealed that less than 20 percent of individuals are using Internet in Laos and Cambodia, which is lower than in Singapore (more than 80 percent) a nd Malaysia (over 70 percent). The low number of Internet users in Laos and Cambod ia might discourage attracting investments, especially for firms which need broadb and access for operating their websites and selling their products online. Therefo re, ASEAN should pursue a universal mobile broadband access across the region to address its limited Internet access, especially in the less developed countries. However, doing so requires a harmonised broadband p lan that will commit each ASEAN member state to have common specific targets. A good example is when member states committed themselves to transfer to d igital broadcasting by 2020. There should also be a special body within the ASEA N Secretariat to serve as an advisory board for setting up a strategic direction towards the development of digital economy. The A.T. Kearney-Axiata study proposed an independent advisory board to provide market analyses and directions for ASEAN\u2019s digital economy. A digital competitiveness index, which is similar t o the European Union\u2019s Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI), could be establis hed for tracking and measuring ASEAN\u2019s digital economic performance.

    "context": "COMMENTARY THE CURRENT cyber threat landscape remains grim: th e world struggles to keep up with growing cyberattacks. According to NTT Corporation, a major ICT service provider in Tokyo, 44 percent of companies have exp erienced a breach in 2019; the estimated costs of recovering from a breach continu e to increase from 9.9 percent of their revenue in 2017 to 12.7 percent in 2019. That is why cybersecurity professionals are in high demand to enhance cybersecurity. Yet, there is an acute shortage of cybersecurity ta lents. Cybersecurity Ventures predicts there will be 3.5 million unfilled cyberse curity jobs by 2021. Pressure Will Grow The pressure to improve cybersecurity is greater wh en a country is preparing for a major international event such as Olympic Games bec ause their success requires both cyber and physical security. Tokyo was selecte d to host the 2020 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2013. This has prompted Japan to strengthen its national cybersecurity capabilities and cultivate cybersecurity talents, because it is cruc ial to manage any potential reputational and cyber risks and ensure to leave a positive legacy for future generations. In the Internet of Things (IoT) era, cross-sectoral collaboration is becoming more important to obtain collective knowledge and tackle with cyberattacks. That is why Japanese industry decided to form the Cross-Sector Forum to establish a good ecosystem to educate, recruit, retain, and train cy bersecurity professionals in collaboration with academia and government. In April 2015, then Senior Executive Vice President Hiromichi Shinohara of NTT, started to talk to his senior counterparts at Japan ese critical infrastructure companies to urge them to launch a forum. The Cross-Sector Forum Finally in June 2015, the forum was founded with 30 major companies from all the critical infrastructure sectors including chemical, financial, manufacturing, media, and transportation. As of today, the forum has 44 members in total. It was groundbreaking for Japanese industry to crea te a cross-sector cooperative framework on their own voluntarily to influence pol icy and share best practices rather than waiting for instructions from the government. Still, the forum members initially faced difficulti es in having frank and open discussions between different critical infrastructure sectors d ue to their different business culture before they build trust over many face-to-face meet ings and after-work drinks. The forum first had to define what cybersecurity profes sionals and their missions mean to end-user companies. Since all the members have a global business presen ce and one-fourth of them are Tokyo 2020 sponsors, the members agreed to adopt a global common language rather than a domestic one, so that they can bring back th eir findings to their subsidiaries outside Japan. Thus, the forum began looking for a global cybersec urity standard for the protection of critical infrastructure and found the National Inst itute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework. Because the Japanese Information-Technology Promoti on Agency (IPA) published a Japanese translated version in May 2014, it became easier for the Japanese forum members to understand the framework to have a holis tic picture to map what cybersecurity missions end users should pursue. NICE Framework: For In-house Cyberscurity The forum had to overcome another challenge due to their unique business culture. Under the lifetime employment system, major Japanes e companies traditionally rotate their employees every two to three years. This help s employees understand the whole picture of the company business but makes it diffic ult to maintain cybersecurity expertise and keep up with ever-growing cybersecuri ty issues. Only 28% of IT professionals work in-house in Japan, wherea s 65% do so in the US and 54% in the UK. Japanese end-user companies tend to out source most IT and cybersecurity work to system integrators and vendor s. The outsourcing culture made the forum pick another global standard, the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Frame work to define skills, which Japanese end user companies typically outsource, su ch as digital forensics to fulfill their missions. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework wa s used to map missions for in- house cybersecurity positions. The forum has published a chart to map different types of cybersecurity jobs from Chief Information Security Officer and auditors to hands-on technical people such as Security Operation Center people and Help Desk, and shows how deep technical knowledge is needed to do their job. Another chart defines what kind of skillsets are needed for so-c alled operational technology (OT) people, who specialise in industria l control systems for critical infrastructure, based on NIST 800-53 Rev. 5 (draft): Security and Privacy Co ntrols for Information Systems and Organizations . NISC: For Policymakers and Educators The forum members also reached out to the Japanese government and universities to incorporate industry\u2019s efforts to cultivate cyberse curity professionals into policy- making and education. The National center of Incident readiness and Strat egy for Cybersecurity (NISC) , which is responsible to make national cybersecuri ty strategy and policy, as well as the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry invites the forum to their strategy committee meetings and ask the fo rum to share their findings. Japanese national strategies refer to the Cross-Sector Forum, introducing their definition of cybersecurity professionals. Furtherm ore, some of the forum members fund universities to create a cybersecurity course and send their employees as lecturers to share their first-hand knowledge to de tect, analyze, and response to cyberattacks. Efforts the forum makes are not just limited to Jap an. They participate in international conferences such as ones hosted by NIST to share how the Cross-Sector Forum uniquely utilizes the NIST and NICE Frameworks to d efine cybersecurity missions and professionals. Since some members have the market i n Southeast Asia, they are actively involved in cybersecurity capacity-buildin g. For example, one of the forum members provided trai n of trainers for a national Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) so that the CERT can conduct further training for local critical infrastructure companie s. Another member hosted a number of cyber exercises and incident response training f or ASEAN countries. Their journey to define cybersecurity missions and talents has helped the Cross- Sector Forum better communicate with the internatio nal cybersecurity community because they are now equipped with a global common language. This also allows the forum to share their learnings to adopt global stan dards and contribute to capacity- building domestically and internationally. Because ASEAN is now expanding its investments in c ybersecurity capacity-building, the forum\u2019s projects are topical and relevant to AS EAN countries. It is the time for Japanese industry to offer its insights to the regi on and contribute to better cyber resiliency in the world. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY OVER THE past few months, extremists have targeted places of worship around the world \u2013 mosques, churches and synagogues. In March 2019, mass shootings at two New Zealand mosques saw over 50 people die at the h ands of a lone white supremacist. This was followed closely by a series of bombings in churches and hotels in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday with more than 250 de ad. A week later, on 28 April 2019, a gunman opened fire in a synagogue in Califo rnia killing one (earlier in October last year, 11 worshippers died in a mass shooting i n a synagogue in Pittsburgh). In the aftermath of such violence, the very best of humanity was on display, manifested in the outpouring of assistance and compassion for those who were injured and for the loved ones of those killed. There was universal condemnation of the attacks and the racial and religious hatred that spawned them. These events also caused disquiet around the world on what appears to be emerging tre nds within countries. Attitudes towards Racial, Religious, and Cultural D ifferences Countering the white supremacist far-right and Isla mist extremists must be a major priority of all governments. Politicians from the l eft and right of the political spectrum play an important role in promoting peace and harmo ny between different social and ethnic groups. Unfortunately, some have acted indifferently, even irresponsibly, towards the increasingly apparent racial, religious, and cultur al divisions within their borders. Instead of attempting to bridge such divides, these politicians deepen the chasms with divisive rhetoric and hate speech. In Europe and elsewhere, some politicians have incr easingly given voice to extremist rhetoric in their quest for votes and popular suppo rt. Such tactics are cause for alarm, especially since studies have shown that leaders ha ve a direct impact on setting the political tone for the country (and sometimes the w orld) and implementing policies on race and religion. Some countries have taken an exclusive approach tow ards the minority groups within their territories, instead of being inclusive and c ulturally sensitive to them. As a result, some who feel marginalised and discriminated leave the country to support extremist causes. Many governments also struggle with the proliferati on of hate speech on the Internet on platforms such as Facebook. Bridging Racial and Cultural Divides What can governments do to create a more harmonious coexistence in our increasingly heterogeneous societies? Harmonious co existence may have been a given in societies that for generations were largel y homogeneous, whether for reasons of ethnicity, such as in the countries of East Asia or Scandinavia, or for reasons of beliefs, such as in the United States or Europe. But homogeneity may be a thing of the past. In today's globalised setting, homogeneity is progr essively giving way to plurality as a result of increased people-to-people exchanges, imm igration, and digital technology. The resultant greater diversity of peoples, beliefs , and opinions can easily become a crucible for racial, religious, and cultural tensio ns and divisions, if not managed carefully. As such, harmonious coexistence is no longer a luxu ry but a necessity, and one that must be consistently embraced by the highest levels of government and across every sector of the population. If we want a garden to be filled with healthy plants, we have to tend it with deliberate love and care. Singapore\u2019s Potential Role as Bridge Builder Singapore is an interesting case study for the fost ering of harmonious coexistence -- one of the fundamental guiding principles of the co untry\u2019s governance is respect for pluralism and diversity of race, religion and cultu re. This cardinal principle has been followed through in law, policy and practice since the country\u2019s independence. The government has secured common spaces for all re ligious and non-religious groups to coexist and flourish. To protect the sanc tity of this negotiated space, special laws have been enacted against hate and attempts to incite enmity and ill-will between different racial and religious groups. This is exte nded to the online world. Singapore\u2019s multi-cultural efforts have been recogn ised. In March 2019, the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, a US-based inter-faith group announced that Singapore\u2019s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will receive the 201 9 World Statesman Award for \u201cfostering a society that embraces multiculturalism in which communities maintain their unique way of life at the same time living harmonio usly\u201d. What More Can Be Done So what more can governments do? There are many constructive steps governments can t ake to strengthen societal bonds and social cohesion. They include encouraging polit icians to refrain from using divisive rhetoric, promoting greater dialogue and interactio n between different racial and religious groups to foster mutual respect and under standing, nurturing shared values across communities, and working with Big Tech to be tter regulate social media and remove postings advocating hate and violence. There are other innovative ways to work more positi vely towards long-term harmonious co-existence, not just within but also a cross borders. \u201cPeople all over the world think of themselves as peace loving and toler ant of other groups, yet enmities and conflict exist. There is an urgent need for bet ter communication and dialogue among different communities,\u201d said Singapore Presid ent Halimah Yacob in an interview on 14 May 2019 in Beijing where she was t o deliver a speech at the inaugural Conference on Dialogue of Asian Civilisations. To this end, President Halimah announced that the f irst International Conference on Cohesive Societies will be held in Singapore from 1 9-21 June 2019. The conference will serve as a platform to bring to gether local and international thought leaders to share their experiences and idea s on how to encourage collective action to bridge the widening divides within societ ies and strengthen social cohesion. The Need to Act Cross-border influences are likely to grow as the w orld becomes more interconnected, thanks to technology and the movement of peoples ac ross borders. At the same time, according to the 2018 Report by the Centre for Stra tegic and International Studies, instances of xenophobia, intolerance, and terrorism are on the rise, with right-wing violent attacks in Europe increasing at least three -fold in four years. Governments have to be vigilant and take serious no te of such phenomenon. Some governments are already dealing with it through pol icy, legislation and community efforts. The exploitation of race and religion may be politically expedient, but it also encourages dangerous sentiments that can lead to co nflict and chaos. There has to be an acknowledgement by governments t hat societies today are under extreme pressure from centrifugal forces. Unless de cisive action is taken to encourage tolerance and cohesion within societies, these forc es can tear societies apart. It is therefore imperative that governments take active m easures to promote harmonious relations between racial, religious and cultural gr oups to ensure a peaceful and better future for all. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY FOR ALL the focus on tariffs in the current \u2018tradew ar\u2019, important though they are, \u2018goods\u2019 \u2212 the things on which tariffs are levie d \u2212 are declining in significance in international trade. Findings in a recent report published by the McKins ey Global Institute, \u2018 Globalisation in Transition: The Future of Trade and Value Chains ,\u2019 suggest global value chains that produce tangible goods have become less trade-inten sive since 2007. Although the production of and trade in goods are still growing in absolute terms, the percentage of goods that are being traded across borders has dimi nished over time (from 28.1 per cent of gross output in 2007 to 22.5 per cent in 20 17). The Declining Importance of Trade in Goods The report identified a couple of key reasons for t he change. More and more of the goods produced in developing countries are being co nsumed domestically as these economies grow. There are also indications that mul tiple stages of production that previously spanned a number of countries are being consolidated within individual countries, thus reducing the need to import interme diate inputs. This is reinforced by the observation, particularly in the automotive and electronics industries, that global value chains for the produc tion of goods are becoming more regionally concentrated in order to improve proximi ty and ability to respond to market demand, and conversely tempering the drivers for gl obal trade. In contrast to the declining importance of trade in goods, McKinsey Global Institute and others (such as Deloitte Insights , Oxford Economics and the WTO ), have found that cross-border trade in services has been growin g faster than trade in goods, and/or become an increasingly significant contributor to n ational GDPs. Growing Importance of Trade in Services and Intangi bles In principle, trade in services can cover all possi ble types of services; at the WTO , it refers to a wide range of activity that includes bu siness and professional services, communication services, construction and related se rvices, distribution services, educational services, energy services, environmenta l services, financial services, health and social services, tourism services and tr ansport services. However, in trade negotiations, we would generally find exclusions when it concerns \u2018services supplied in the exercise of governmental authority\u2019 (such as social security, health, education and other such services). Although official statistics suggest that the gross value of trade in services is lower than trade in goods (approximately US$5 trillion vs . US$17 trillion in 2017), there are good reasons to believe that official statistics do not accurately capture activity that is taking place in this space. Existing statistical collection frameworks were dev ised and are built around an era in which trade in goods dominated, and are consequentl y not currently well-suited to measure trade in services. For instance, much of wh at we currently count as trade in goods embodies significant elements that we might w ish to attribute to trade in services (e.g. marketing) or other intangibles (e.g . R&D, branding). Existing statistical reporting categories also do n ot capture new types of activities that have emerged, become commercialised and grown in re cent years (e.g. cross-border provision of cloud computing services, media stream ing services). One could confidently assume that services and othe r intangibles comprise a much bigger component of cross-border trade than is curr ently measured by official trade statistics. In fact, the McKinsey Global Institute reckons that services are already worth more than goods in cross-border trade. Need to Refocus on Trade in Services Although trade in services is on the work programme of the WTO, it has been effectively neglected for a number of years. There has not been much progress beyond the General Agreement for Trade in Services , which entered into force in 1995 following the Uruguay round of trade negotiations. An attempt at cobbling together a Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) among a group of like-minded countries under the aegis of the WTO appear to have stalled since the last round of talks in November 2016. On its website , the European Commission \u2013 the European Union is a party to TiSA \u2013 stated that, \u2018n egotiations are now on hold and are expected to resume when the political context allow s. There is no formally set deadline for ending the negotiations\u2019. Given its current and prospective significance, pol icy makers and national legislators, such as those who will be attending a WTO workshop in June 2019 organised by the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS ), should revisit and identify ways to promote and facilitate on-going and future trade in services and other intangibles. The immediate task for all trading economies would be to review and improve the production of statistics that capture trade in serv ices to better inform public debate and policy-making. The revised Manual on Statistics of International Trade in Serv ices adopted by the United Nations Statistical Commissio n in 2010 offers a starting point, and should be implemented by all statistical collec ting agencies. The Future is in Trade in Services The challenge would lie in balancing the need for d ata against the cost and effort of collection, as well as responding to rapid changes in contemporary economies (such as the emergence of media-streaming services). The second task is to pick up the pace in reducing existing barriers to trade, preferably on a global multilateral basis. Typical barriers to trade in services are restrictions on the establishment of foreign operations, the moveme nt of people, technical standards, certification requirements and permits, or licence requirements. Parties to TiSA should return to the negotiating ta ble. Economies that are not yet a party to TiSA should give serious consideration to participating in negotiations. Any eventual agreement would not only liberalise trade, thus potentially enhancing economic performance, but also set standards and be nchmarks for the future evolution of the global trading economy. Trade in goods still comprise a significant proport ion of global trade, but trade in services is where future, if not current, opportuni ties for significant economic growth lies. Policy makers would do well to rise above mis guided arguments that have been presented in current debates on economic nationalis m. They should focus their minds on continuing to harn ess the wider benefits of economic multilateralism by reducing barriers to trade, espe cially trade in services, in order to further grow the economic \u2018pie\u2019 from which national debates about economic distribution can take place. The current sluggish s tate of economic performance in the global economy strengthens this call to action. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY IN THE past couple of years, discussions on AI ethi cs became the norm, with a variety of actors putting forth over 40 sets of fairly iden tical principles. These principles include: accountability, controllability, diversity , explainability, fairness, human- centricity, transparency, safety, security, and sus tainability. While this creates a shared language assisting coun tries in addressing similar concerns, the local interpretation of these princip les can differ widely, often leading to a deep sense of confusion. With the wide proliferat ion of such AI ethics principles, practitioners are getting closer to agreeing on wha t they should be in theory, but not on how to make them work in practice. Problem of Effective Implementation Principles like the ones recently published by the OECD are illustrative. They combine many existing works on AI ethics principles into an other fairly generic guideline. This level of abstraction makes it appealing enough to c reate an important international consensus. It is also, however, vague enough to allow local ac tors to interpret the principles as they see fit within their own social and cultural c ontexts. This diversity of interpretation is essential in ensuring that benefits brought to h umanity by using AI are inclusive. The problem is, therefore, one of effective impleme ntation. The problem of effective implementation is the test bed of these principles, which can often be detached from technical capabilities and h uman practices. Can these AI ethics principles be codified into technical and hu man practices? In theory, yes. The abovementioned principles benefit us. They are inte nded to keep us safe and help us all benefit from the use of AI. In practice, however, they face real-life conflict of interests such as corporate profitability, individual and collective biases and inequality, low general levels of technical literacy, the sanctification of progress, and the desire for constant convenience. Moving from Principles to Action The good news is that this problem is already being partially solved. Individuals and institutions working in the AI ethics field are mov ing from principles to action. The IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intel ligent Systems led to the creation of a series of technical standards on AI ethics. T he IEEE is the world\u2019s largest association of technical professionals. The Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in M achine Learning (FAT/ML) community brings together researchers and practitio ners developing tangible solutions. The Machine Intelligence Research Instit ute (MIRI), the Center for Human- Compatible AI (CHAI), and safety teams at DeepMind and OpenAI work to develop safe and robust AI. Institutions like AI NOW, Data & Society, and various academic centers are getting to the heart of socio-technical problems and how they already impact users. The bad news, however, is that while this work cont ributes immensely to the beneficial development and use of AI, it is still only the beg inning. We need wider geographical participation and action to put AI ethics principle s into practice and create inclusive benefits. Until we are able to achieve that, any be nefits called for in AI ethics principles run the risk of staying as an idealistic vision for a speculative future. Coming to Terms with the Present While AI might still look futuristic, its early sta ge applications are already as widespread as they are pervasive. To most, AI is in visible. Users cannot really see it or interact with it, and they often do not understa nd how it works or affects them and their actions. And yet, most regulations and AI eth ics principles look towards the theoretical future and thus fail to address the imp lementation programme. Due to their soft governance nature, most AI ethics principles do not offer tangible solutions. More alarmingly, many government regulat ors remains unwilling to offer tangible solutions due to fears that overregulation will \u2018stifle innovation\u2019. This creates a false dichotomy where ethical and we ll-regulated developments \u2018sacrifice\u2019 speed or innovation to ensure benefit. In reality, not making this \u2018sacrifice\u2019 leads to development that is prone to structural er rors, stalls in achieving market viability, and mostly just serves its developers. Additions to the over 40 existing sets of AI ethics principles are a positive and welcome development if they represent new concerns and popu lation groups. But things will only change when local governments interpret and im plement them in local regulations and more institutions develop technical tools and m ethods to put them into practice. Tangible solutions are within reach. The Small Country Advantage Smaller countries have an edge in solving this prob lem. As importers of technology from larger countries, smaller ones often find them selves relying on tools not developed with their social and technical needs in mind. This entails an adjustment and adaptation period for users and the technology itself. All governments must, therefore, invest in creating regulatory and technical sandboxes to ensure the adjustment and adaptation period goes as smoothly as possible and comes to positive conclusions. But small government s can do it faster and more efficiently. To that end, they should do two things : The first is to institute agile regulatory mechanis ms that develop with and support the nation\u2019s beneficial use of AI. The second is to inv est in creating well-informed and resourced actors that put local AI ethics principle s interpretations into practice. Investment in a competitive future should be about beneficial development, not just a rapid one. If not, our future will see us spending years trying to identify and fix the mistakes we have made in the name of careless progr ess, and that\u2019s the best case scenario. In short: put well-considered theory into thoughtful local regulatory and technical practice, because 40+ sets of AI ethics p rinciples will not work unless you do. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY THE OUTBREAK of war between Russia and Ukraine on 24 February 2022 has led to massive consequences for food security worldwide, including in Asia. As major grain exporters, Russi a and Ukraine account for around 25 -30% of the world\u2019s global wheat exports and 30% of the world\u2019s barley exports. Ukraine also supplies 15% of the world\u2019s corn exports. Food insecurity in Asia brought on by the conflict is exacerbated by other enormous challenges, including export bans, disruptions to the global supply chains from the pandemic, rising energy costs, and climate change impacts. Given a significant amount of the world\u2019s fertilisers are produced in Russia, Western sanctions on Russia are cau sing fertiliser prices to skyrocket . Asian Responses to Ukraine Crisis As Asia is a major importer of Ukrainian and Russi an grain, vegetable oils, and fertilisers, countries will be forced to find alternative sources. They may also compete to secure the reduced availability of raw agricultural commodities. The above comes on top of pandemic -induced challenges facing Asia n policymakers to achieve food and nutrition security. Consumers will ultimately feel the consequential effects of rising food and energy prices. One immediate effect of the crisis has been the disruption of grain shipments through the Black Sea, causing a ripple effect of food price spikes worldwide. Since the outbreak of the war, wheat prices have jumped by 21%, barley by 33%, and various fertilisers by 40% . However, the threat of disruptions to Ukraine\u2019s planting season suggests that the worst is still yet to come if this year\u2019s crops cannot be planted. In response to these challenges, particula rly soaring global food prices and inflation rates, many governments in Asia have put forward measures to safeguard food security amidst fear of food shortages and social and political instability. In Thailand, South Korea, and the Philippines , feed buyers issued buy tenders for feed wheat. Other countries have called for the strengthening of domestic agricultural production. In China, there is continued pressure from the country\u2019s top leaders on farmers to strengthen food security against the backdrop of lingering tensions over the US -China trade war. Recently, President Xi Jinping declared that China must ensure grain security and reliance on the domestic market to maintain production, while China\u2019s lawmakers will review a bill on food security. In Japan, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party has adopted a resolution calling on the government to strengthen its food security policy. Elsewhere, India has removed the basic customs duty on edible oils while Malaysia is imposing price controls and grants to ease cost pressures. Some countries may also start imposing export bans on food items that they deem essential for their domestic consumption, as Indonesia, India, Argentina, a nd others have done. Search for Alternative Food Sources Aside from aiming to boost food production in Asia, some countries may seek alternative markets for imports. For other major agricultural exporters, like Australia and India, the Ukraine -Russia War offers an opportunity to increase production and exports. With Australian farmers currently experiencing bumper grain harvests , their exports could hel p fill the gap and reduce the uncertainty in the global grain trade, although the planting seasons are different. Alternative wheat markets like India, Australia, and the European Union (EU) are expected to increase exports given their record crops and competitive prices . They currently make up 5%, 13%, and 18% of the world\u2019s wheat exports, respectively. For corn, aside from the United States, which accounts for 33% of the world\u2019s corn exports, new crop supplies from Argentina (22% of the world\u2019s corn exports) and Brazil (17%) are likely to come onto the market in a few months. For barley, Australia and Canada\u2019s productions have increased along with the exportable supplies. They hold 26% and 5%, respectively, of the world\u2019s barley exports. Aggravating Factors to the Ukraine Crisis Increasin g food production in Asia and other major agriculture - producing countries to make up for the Ukraine -Russia grain exports may not be straightforward. Russia annually exports over 50 million tonnes of fertilisers , accounting for 13% of the global total, with much going to Asia. The West's sanctions on Russia have caused disruptio ns to the global trade of fertiliser and increased costs to farmers. Many freight companies are unwilling to ship bulk supplies of fertilisers out of Russia. As the disaster in Sri Lanka\u2019s fertiliser policies shows, crop yields immediately drop without synthetic fertilisers. In Brazil, some farmers are trying to use less fertiliser to grow corn. For countries like Australia and United States, which aim to increase agricultural production to capitalise on the crisis, rising fertiliser costs combined with soaring f uel costs mean that farmers are faced with a situation where the cost of farming is fast overtaking grain prices . Another major challenge is climate change, especially in countries that could help make up the gap in food exports left by Ukraine and Russia. Recent droughts in South America have resulted in a decline in harvests . In the US, farmers in California lost an estimated US$1.1 billion due to the ongoing mega -drought . China has also suffered from flooding in many agricultural areas. Near Term Outlook Any prolonged crisis that disrupts supply chains and farm operations will lead to diminished stocks of important food security item s, especially if Ukrainian and Russian farmers cannot plant for the next season. For countries that import fertiliser, increased prices and a shortage could mean planting smaller crop areas and lower yields. Some countries which have stockpiles may yet b e able to tide over the supply crisis. For example, China has reportedly been building up its wheat stocks over the past year and now has 51% of the world's wheat stocks. But for many others, the food situation will inevitably face much uncertainty in the coming months. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY AMID GROWING tensions between the United States and China, Washington has announced a new South China Sea policy. The new policy was expressed by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on 13 July 2020 as the two powers locked horns on multiple fronts from economic and technological competition and issues over Hong Kong and Xinjiang, to the confrontation in the South China Se a. The new policy statement called out Chinese coercive actions against its Southeast Asian neighbours and promised support in protection of their respective maritime rights. The stronger US stance came after a landmark US -Japan -Australia joint statement of 7 July, condemning Chinese actions in the region. The trilateral declaration was followed by unilateral statements by Japan, Australia and India, among others, along the same tone. Why the New US Policy Pompeo\u2019s statement made the intention of the new policy crystal clear: \u201cBeijing\u2019s claims to offshore resources across most of the South China Sea are completely unlawful, as is its campaign of bullying to control them\u201d. The policy aligned the US South China Sea position closely with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the 2016 Philippines versus China international arbitration ruling, which delegitimised claims to historic rights and China\u2019s so-called nine -dashed line in the South China Sea as the basis of Beijing\u2019s claims. The statement therefore also showed Washington\u2019s strong support for the declaration made by ASEAN leaders at the end of the 36th ASEAN Summit on 26 June 2020, insisting that all maritime claims to be based on international law, and especially the UNCLOS. Not all this is new, though. Washington has consistently denounced Chinese excessive and illegal maritime claims in South China Sea, including the nine -dashed line, and has increasingly called out Chinese bullying of other South China Sea claimant states. More Explicit Tone What is different, however, is the explicit tone and message it sends to Beijing as well as allies and partners in the region that the US is doubling down on stopping China\u2019s coercive actions in the South China Sea. As a clear signal t o allies and partners, the statement singles out Chinese assertive actions in the Philippines\u2019 Scarborough Shoal, Mischief Reef, and the Second Thomas Shoal, Vietnam\u2019s Vanguard Bank, Malaysia\u2019s Luconia Shoals, and Natuna Basar off Indonesia. It calls out China\u2019s harassment of coastal states\u2019 legitimate fishing and hydrocarbon development activities around those maritime features. The policy thus gives explicit US support to those states and the exercise of their rights within their respective maritime zone s, receiving positive acknowledgments from the region.  In addition, the support for claimants to exercise their legal rights in their respective exclusive economic zones gives Washington a new tone to its actions in the South China Sea, one that has more credibility than backing all US moves under the assertion to uphold the freedom of navigation in the region. The two need to go hand in hand. China\u2019s Response & What Lies Ahead China, unsurprisingly, was unhappy about the US statement and followed up with the rather usual tirade. Beijing lashed Washington on interfering in the region\u2019s issues and on unnecessarily escalating the situation. Beijing views the new statement as a significant shift in Washington\u2019s policy toward South China Sea, abandoning the s tated neutrality on sovereignty disputes. Instead, China sees the new US policy as a direct challenge to its own position and blames Washington on putting a wedge between itself and Southeast Asian claimant states. With the South China Sea policy statemen t, US created itself a more explicit policy framework for activities that would deter what Pompeo accused as attempts to create a Chinese \u201cmaritime empire\u201d in the South China Sea and support the smaller Southeast Asian coastal states\u2019 rights and freedoms i n their respective exclusive economic zones (EEZs). For the US, however, the real challenge still lies ahead. How Washington go on to implement the strongly -worded policy matters ultimately more than the statement itself. In a keynote speech to the tenth annual CSIS South China Sea conference, on 14 July 2020, the US Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs David Stilwell said that \u201call tools are on the table\u201d and hinted that there certainly was room to sanction Chine se officials and state -owned enterprises that engage in illegal activities. An example of possible US actions that will follow took place from late April till early May when Chinese Haiyang Dizhi 8 oil exploration vessel, flanked by Chinese maritime militi a and coast guard boats, intruded into Malaysia\u2019s EEZ. Ostensibly to survey the area, the Chinese vessels harassed the Petronas -operated West Capella rig\u2019s drilling operations, inviting a close monitoring by nearby US Navy warships. Following this brief s tandoff, the US Navy\u2019s littoral combat ships intermittently made themselves seen by Chinese surveillance vessels. The Navy has thus made its presence seen and felt for all sides. Whether these examples have provided a precedence for the future US Navy miss ions and involvement in disputes remains to be seen. Legitimacy and Credibility It goes without saying that while stronger US support for weaker states\u2019 maritime rights is welcomed, it also raises tension in the region. With the stronger, more muscular US Navy presence comes more frequent encounters with Chinese counterparts and, therefore, grown risk of accidents and escalation. Washington must therefore ensure that its actions, while deliberate, are both credible, controlled and legitimate, and avoid ent angling smaller states between the two behemoths navies. Ideally, US presence comes in frequent coordination with allies and partners, giving any action it takes broader legitimacy. Ultimately, legitimacy is the most critical enabler for any US action in the South China Sea and how those actions will be received and perceived by others. It is, nevertheless, a good start that the US is voicing support for the 36th ASEAN Summit chairman\u2019s statement and backing allies and partners  \u0336 such as Japan, Australi a, India  \u0336 in unilateral as well as joint statements that call out Chinese coercive actions. It is also helpful that Washington is insisting on the primacy of international rules and norms over \u201cmight makes right\u201d. Probably not in too distant future, we will see whether Washington will be willing to follow through with this bold policy statement. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY TENSE RUSSIA -UKRAINE relations are not new. Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and has since continued to back separatists in Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region. In December 2021, the world noticed Moscow\u2019s deployment of more than 100,000 Russian troops, raising suspicion s over a potential invasion of Ukraine. Ever since, the United States and its NATO partners, perhaps most simplified as \u201cthe West\u201d, are at heightened alert. Ridiculing President Putin\u2019s great power phantasies or his ostensible fear of NATO is Western hypocrisy. Of course Putin does not fear the defence organisation NATO as a direct security threat because the aggressor here is evidently Mosco w. What Does Putin Really Want? Nonetheless, the West has not paid sufficient attention to Russian security demands in the recent past. Putin has not always been opposed to NATO, but for two decades, he has requested that Russia must be an equal partner in rearranging the post -Cold War European security architecture. In particular, Russia seeks to keep the now more or less independent former Soviet Republics as Russia\u2019s sphere of influence. Ukraine is of particular importance due to its strategic locati on and long history of being part of the Russian Empire and USSR. In 2001, Putin articulated this request in the German Bundestag, and he repeated himself at the Munich Security Conference in 2007, albeit in much harsher terms by then. All such requests received widespread support in Europe in -principle, only to be ignored thereafter. So in reality, the West knows the price for an accommodation with Moscow put an end to NATO expansion and involve Russia in the design of Eastern European security, which means de facto accepting Russian influence in the EU\u2019s Eastern neighbourhood. Spheres of Influence: Not a Cold War Relict It is good that the US, France and Germany, as well as NATO are talking to Russia in earnest and at eye -level again. Given European history and the great role Russia has in it, this should be a matter -of-course. The imp ression that it needed Russian force is unfortunate. It is equally unfortunate that red herrings dominate the debate: Moscow seeks to undermine the European Union and NATO; Putin fears not NATO missiles but democracy. NATO never expanded eastwards but many former Warsaw Pact countries sought to move westwards because they (correctly) identify Moscow as the source of their insecurity, especially since the Russian war against Georgia in 2008 and the 2014 annexation of Crimea. If it is Russia\u2019s intention to bind former Soviet Republics, it is not doing a great job at it. All these arguments are correct but are besides the point. As painful as it is after decades of peaceful institutionalised integration in Europe, the real debate must once again be about spheres of influence. Living next to a giant who interprets international relations as every great power has done th roughout history, requires an appreciation that the European model of regional integration and collective security is exclusively that: European. It is the nature of international relations that the most consequential powers seek their own path and deman d spheres of influence, buffer zones of exclusive influence. The US has it in the Western Hemisphere, the EU established it by peaceful means of neighbourhood integration, and indeed Russia de facto has it in the Caucasus and along its Central Asian border s. Accepting this is not appeasement but a realistic view on international relations. A New European Joint Security Order NATO is for now committed to upholding its open door policy. This should be revised. The logical consequence of a recognition of a Russian sphere of influence is ruling out further NATO expansion. This is not simply giving in to Russian demands at the barrel of the gun but a realistic acceptan ce that further expansion would not increase but decrease Europe\u2019s geopolitical security. Russia is the aggressor and Moscow\u2019s actions are deeply objectionable. However, a geopolitical symbolism such as ruling out NATO membership of Ukraine and Georgia will get Europe out of the current escalation spiral. And it is indeed symbolism, for expansion is currently not on NATO\u2019s agenda anyway, and no ally will go to war with Russia over Ukraine. Nor is there an automatism for expansion. Allies decide case -by-case with unanimity and for the foreseeable future, Germany and others are not going to support expansion. Alas, with spheres of influence come buffer zones, and Ukraine will have to become one. This cannot be negotiated without Kiev. A power -conc ert carve -up of Eastern Europe, as in 1939, must not be repeated. Kiev must be part of a neutralisation process, comparable to Austria in 1955, including strict conditions, obligations, and guarantees attached. This concession would be painful to accept f or many Ukrainians and Europeans, including this author, and for many in Washington, who persistently fail to grasp the diverse range of European perspectives on continental security. But in final consequence, this would be the least painful arrangement. It can help to create a basis for more fundamental talks with Russia about a new, joint European security order, and to hopefully work on and towards mutual interests, of which there are many. It is a clich\u00e9 but true: peace in Europe can only be maintai ned with, not against Russia. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY COVID -19 IS catapulting the digital economy to the fore. Strained state finances, and a booming digital economy amidst social distancing and accelerating connectivity, spotlight the potential of taxing t his growing pie. Negotiations for a multilateral tax treaty are ongoing in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s (OECD) even as the pandemic diverts political energy and provides pretext for delay. Can countries cobble together a co nsensus, and in what ways will agreement be meaningful? State of Play Originally slated for a December 2020 deadline, the OECD\u2019s Inclusive Framework now aims to lock in by mid-2021 global guidelines on taxing multinational enterprises (MNEs) that meet a tentative revenue floor of 750 million euros. Pillar One of the Framework would create rules for taxing digitally -enabled businesses that so far pay lower rates, despite a significant economic presence, because they do not have a permanent establishment in host economies. Pillar Two , meanwhile, would introduce a minimum tax on MNEs. The Framework\u2019s significance is manifold. First, it reflects a longstanding debate over tax sovereignty: states lose out on an estimated US$20 0 billion per year to tax havens, and have struggled with taxing digital businesses. Second , it would be an additional revenue stream in the digital economy, considering that the World Trade Organisation\u2019s e -commerce moratorium prohibits tariffs on elect ronic goods, and could contribute to domestic resource mobilisation (Sustainable Development Goal 17.1). In providing some relief to governments, it could ideally mitigate attempts to squeeze revenue from elsewhere, such as increased inspections further straining international trade. Third , sans consensus, the levying of potentially discriminatory unilateral taxes leaves the door open for disputes. This may prompt retaliatory weaponisation of economic relationships, such as trade, in a global economy already suffering from a short supply of stability and certainty. Breakthrough or Falling Through? With much riding on the line, can there be a global consens us? Familiar challenges beset a resolution. COVID -19 is both fillip and obstacle. As with many international fora, virtual summitry falls short in facilitating informal conversations necessary for diplomacy. Multiple interests, moreover, are a hallmark of multilateral agreements. The Inclusive Framework is no different. Disagreement arises over scope. It is unclear what MNEs are covered by the Framework. While originally designed to target digital giants, this mainly entailed taxing US MNEs besides a ha ndful of Chinese and European firms \u2014 a move Washington decried as discriminatory, despite these MNEs being affected on grounds of being the main beneficiaries of the current rules -based economic system rather than citizenship. Since then, consumer -facing businesses have been added to the list. There is also debate over whether the Framework should be mandatory. In December 2019, the Trump administration advocated for a Safe Harbour proposal, which would allow firms to voluntarily opt -in for Pillar One. It is not, however, all doom and gloom. Businesses are willing to comply with a global framework in lieu of a regu latory noodle bowl. Much resistance is concentrated on Pillar One (taxing digitally -enabled businesses), but both the US and developing countries, which usually champion precautionary digital rule -making, have generally approved of implementing Pillar Two (introducing minimum taxes on MNEs) first. Yet while the OECD\u2019s recent economic impact assessment suggests that governments may accrue more fiscal revenue through Pillar Two, many state s are pushing for a concurrent advance. Pillar Two alone will not reallocate taxing rights in a digital age. In this sense, it perhaps only partially ref lects broader contestations over the spoils of the digital economy. Security Taxing Multilateralism To some extent, the digital economy is modifying the interests of different political -economic factions, but also historically like -minded countries such as the OECD membership. Digital taxes are a bone of contention in the US -European Union relations. Europe is now a source, rather than beneficiary , of rents or unearned profits. Just as Washington under Trump opposes the taxing of its MNEs, which might cut into R&D funding and hence its technological edge, it is in Europe\u2019s interest to impose them. Seen i n this light, the Trump administration\u2019s decision to abandon negotiations in June is perhaps unsurprising. Some place high hopes for a reversal of fortunes following the US\u2019 November presidential election, which is still hanging in the balance at this time of writing. Yet bipartisan consensus and differences with like -minded allies on digital taxes harks back even to the Obama era. It remains to be seen whether a Biden White House augurs well for consensus, even if it could put greater multilateral involvement back on the cards. Moreover, how much reliability and certainty can a rules -based order proffer if members selectively follow the ru les? Heightened national security concerns call into question the meaningfulness of any potential consensus, given a mindset shift in Washington over a fading liberal economic order and threatened American exceptionalism. This is on top of other security concerns which might blunt the Framework\u2019s implementation. For one, it is not clear how tax incentives will impact effective tax rates and hence revenues gained from the Framework; governments see them as a way of attracting investment and protecting econo mic security. For another, levying these taxes can depend on exchange of information between jurisdictions. Yet requests for data can be and are rejected on grounds of data insecurity or poor privacy and civil liberty laws. This lack of capacity could disproportionately affect less developed countries in greater need of tax justice. Way Forward: Reframe Global Negotiations? Overall, countries could go it alone in the event of talks breaking down. Digital value - added taxes toe legal lines, for instance. But this may be politically tone deaf in a post - COVID world where economic inequalities are front and centre \u2014 although corporate income taxes do not negate the odds of costs being passed on to smaller businesses and consumers regardless. Alternatively, agreement without the US would be defanged considering the market share of American firms an d Washington\u2019s capacity for inflicting punitive measures. Forging a consensus will hence be no easy feat, but necessary. It may require treating digital taxes as part of a broader rather than standalone agreement, with compromises on this front being tra ded for concessions on digital trade. To that end, putting the national security genie back in the bottle to de -escalate tensions and reframe negotiations will be a critical first step. Still, only time will tell how other spectres of insecurity \u2014 whether economic or data -based \u2014 might hinder the realisation of a more sustainable global economic system, or a significant shift in power between states and markets overall.

    "context": "COMMENTARY WHEN A military organisation undertakes a modernisa tion programme, it is intuitive to expect that the weapons systems (along with the underlying technologies) that are being acquired are going to be \u201cbetter\u201d than the we apons systems being retired. The problem is, what does \u201cbetter\u201d actually mean? Given the increasingly exorbitant costs of new weap ons systems, and that scarce public resources are being expended on a military o rganisation \u2014 at the expense of other national spending priorities such as educatio n, health and infrastructure development \u2014 this is a fundamentally important que stion that needs to be asked, and convincingly answered (if at all possible). The Metrics of \u201cBetter\u201d Weapons Systems Given that the ultimate function of any military or ganisation is the protection of the state from external, and sometimes existential, thr eats, the desire for \u201cbetter\u201d weapons systems is intuitive and necessary. But how these w eapons systems contribute towards the military organisation being able to rea lise its function vary from peace- time to war-time. A peace-time military organisation seeks to dissuad e \u2014 more precisely, deter \u2014 its adversary (or adversaries, as the case may be) from initiating hostile military operations against the state; whereas a war-time mi litary organisation seeks to defeat \u2014 more precisely, attain strategic success against \u2014 its enemy. However, both deterrence and strategic success are problematic co ncepts. To either deter an adversary from initiating hostil e military actions or defeat an enemy at war, what the military organisation needs is the same across both scenarios: to be \u201cbetter\u201d than its adversary or enemy. Very often, t his condition of being better than the adversary or enemy is measured by lethality . The difference between a peace-time military organi sation from its war-time counterpart is that, in the first instance, this le thality is potential, whereas in the second instance it is actual. What is Lethality? Lethality is determined by a series of secondary ch aracteristics. Survivability is important, because if your weapons systems are more survivable than those of your adversary or enemy, it means your military organisa tion can be more lethal than its counterpart. In an age of computer networks and joi nt military operations, data linkages and bandwidths are also important considerations. This is because they allow the military organisatio n to do away with traditional inter- service rivalries, and function as a single, cohere nt entity, and to engage enemy forces (a euphemism for lethality) with any available weap ons systems deployed on air-, land- , or sea-based platforms. Precision sensing and targeting are also important, because these capabilities allow you to \u201csee\u201d its enemy first, and bring letha l fires to bear against it, with greater accuracy \u2014 an important consideration given the increasing costs of modern weapons systems \u2014 before the enemy can \u201csee\u201d your o wn forces.

    "context": "COMMENTARY THE OUTBREAK of hostilities on 27 September 2020 over Nagorno -Karabakh (NK) between Armenia and Azerbaijan and the political upheaval in Kyrgyzstan over disputed parliamentary elections on 5 October, do not mean Russian influence in the region is on the wane. Rather, they manifest underlying instabi lity in parts of the former Soviet space, due to unresolved political and territorial differences. The Russian -brokered Armenian -Azeri ceasefire agreement on 10 October has since broken down. In Kyrgystan, Moscow is cautious in approaching the dramatic power play where President Sooronbai Jeenbekov had resigned and his political rival, Sadyr Japarov, is now acting president after becoming appointed prime minister. President Vladimir Putin has avoided getting directly involved in the turmoil in the Kyrgy z republic. Russia\u2019s Balancing Strategy Russia has had good reasons not to portray itself as an overbearing factor in these countries\u2019 affairs though it is clear that only Moscow has the resources, political will and motivation to play the crucial role in any solution. President Putin\u2019s attention has been focussed on domestic socio -economic issues arising from the negative impact of COVID -19 on the economy and nearer home, the political trouble in Belarus. Relations with the European Union, principall y Germany, have deteriorated further over the imposition of limited sanctions over the poisoning of Alexei Navalny. Moreover, the final stages of the US presidential election and latest polls indicating a possible Biden victory, occupy Putin\u2019s mind, given his admiration for President Donald Trump. Together with the US and France, Russia is a co -chair of the Minsk Group, which since 1994, has spearheaded international efforts to find a peaceful solution to the NK conflict. Russia has close but balanced re lations with Armenia and Azerbaijan. While Armenia is a member of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) with a Russian military base on its territory, Russian obligations to Armenia\u2019s defence are confined to external attacks on its territor y (NK is not internationally recognised as Armenian territory). Armenia is also a member of the Russian -led Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU); Russia is its major trade partner. Russia is reportedly not enamoured of the current Armenian government which it sees as having come to power as a consequence of street demonstrations against the previous government, said to have been friendlier to Moscow. Hence, it does not feel pressure to militarily support Armenia. Azerbaijan\u2019s military is stronger than Armenia\u2019 s. With 10 million people and an energy - rich economy, it has the advantage over the smaller Armenia with its three million population. Russia neither wants a total Azeri victory nor an indisputable Armenian defeat. To balance them, Russia has been selling weapons to both sides. There is also a domestic dimension to Russia\u2019s calculations. There is a very large Azeri and Armenian diaspora in Russia (about two million for each community) and Moscow is keen on ensuring that the current conflict does not trans late into instability between these communities on Russian soil. The Turkish Factor Turkey\u2019s support of Azerbaijan is of concern to Russia; it already has policy differences with Turkey over Syria and Libya. Since Azerbaijan is already close to Turkey, R ussia does not wish to push it closer to Ankara by openly supporting Armenia. Russian concern about growing Turkish influence in Azerbaijan is also linked to a deep fear of the possible introduction of Syrian fighters aligned to Turkey into the Caucasus, where Russia is battling Chechens and other Muslim groups. Escalation of the conflict could also drag Russia into hostilities with Turkey. Russia would not want to upset its relations with Turkey. As pointed out by President Putin at the annual Valdai Di scussion Club (VDC) in Moscow on 22 October, bilateral trade between the two countries exceeded US$20 billion, both sides implemented the TurkStream energy project and Turkey purchased Russia\u2019s S -400 missile system. It also stands to reason that Turkey\u2019s troubled relations with NATO are not necessarily disadvantageous to Russia\u2019s strategic interests. The Kyrgyz Front Russia has links with the opposing sides and does not want to appear favouring factions in the traditional north -south divide. Members of the Kyrgyz elite are invariably Russian -educated, retain strong links with and look to Russia more than any other power. While neighbouring China\u2019s economic influence is strong, anti -Chinese sentiments in Kyrgyzstan are rising and becoming harder to manage . Remittances from Kyrgyz migrant workers in Russia accounted for around a third of gross domestic product in 2018; while COVID -19 has led to many losing their jobs,  Russia is likely to remain its main market for Kyrgyz labour; being a member of the EAE U, Kyrgyz workers do not require a work permit. Russia has also implemented projects valued at US$500 million. Kyrgyzstan is a CSTO member and hosts a major Russian air base. While Russia is concerned about the situation, direct Russian intervention is u nlikely. There is no direct land access to Kyrgyzstan for Russia to project its military power rapidly and efficiently. Russia is also mindful of the probable negative Western reaction to any intervention and would not want to introduce an additional issue into its current tense relations with the West. Thirdly, no anti -Russian sentiments have been expressed by the competing factions in Kyrgyzstan. Finally, Russia did not directly intervene in the previous political upheavals in 2005 and 2010; there is no compelling reason for it to do so now. Avoiding EU and US Entry Given the protracted and highly emotional nature of the NK conflict and the role of Turkey, Russia has to move strategically. Moscow has no desire to let the EU and the US into this arena, and complicate Moscow\u2019s own balancing strategy. The ambitions of the Turkish president and his Azeri counterpart require careful handling as they could complicate Russian interests in the Middle East and the Black Sea/Caspian Sea region. It is also to o early to ascertain whether and how Kyrgyzstan\u2019s political turmoil could end soon. However, the one constant factor is that without Russia\u2019s involvement or influence one way or the other, the chances of any solution to these unstable developments would be practically nil. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY On 15 MARCH 2019, Brenton Tarrant, an Australian se lf-declared fascist, opened fire on congregants in two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, slaughtering 49 worshippers. Tarrant recorded and live-streamed the slaughter on Facebook using a helmet camera. Prior to the attack, he also left a 74-page manifesto on a Twitter account which detailed his hatred for immigrants, M uslims, and Jews, and in which he explained his actions as wanting to defend \u201cour lan ds\u201d from the \u201cinvaders\u201d. The tactic used by far-right violent extremists and white supremacists like Tarrant of slaughtering unsuspecting individuals in their plac e of worship is not new: February 1994, an American-Israeli Jewish extremist, slaught ered nine congregants in a Hebron mosque, in West Bank; June 2015, a white supremacis t slaughtered nine individuals in a black church in South Carolina, United States; February 2017, another white supremacist slaughtered six people in a Quebec mosq ue, in Canada; October 2018, an anti-Semitic white supremacist slaughtered 11 pe ople in the Tree of Life synagogue in Pennsylvania, United States. Logic of Live-Streaming Images of Slaughter What makes this most recent act of terrorism in New Zealand notable is not just the sheer number of victims, but that the shooter live- streamed the murders on a social media account. But here again, graphic recording of brutal acts is not unique; members of the radical Islamist movement, ISIS, are infamously known for recording, and later uploading, videos of brutal beheadings. Scholars of terrorism studies explain the logic of recording and uploading images of slaughter to social media in two broad ways: First, as a tactic to get attention from a public that is already somewhat desensitised to vio lence and terrorism; and second, as a way to heighten the shock-and-awe and the dram a of terrorism, and thereby to instill more fear amongst the persons of the target ed group. I argue that there are two additional reasons for t his gruesome tactic that can be summarised as follows: power play, and as method to dehumanise the enemy. First, as a power play, recorded images of brutality eleva te the significance of terrorism from its designated smaller scale unconventional war dom ain, to that of grander war that can compete with the grandest visuals of brutality that we have come to expect from conventional wars. Second, the disseminating of recorded images of bru tal acts serves to belittle and dehumanise the victims. Consider, for example, ISIS \u2019 tactic of beheading its victims and then putting their severed head on their torso. This imagery, I argue, is a kind of iconography intended not only to generate repulsion for a visual that appears shockingly grotesque, but also to depict the ultima te weakness and powerlessness of the enemy. The Logic of Dehumanising the Other Recorded acts of brutality dehumanise the victims b y depicting them as vulnerable and thus as \u2018less than\u2019 the other humans. Demeaning language is another venue for dehumanisation of the other. For example, Adolf Hit ler referred to Jews as snakes and leeches. Heinrich Himmler \u2014 a prominent leader of t he German Nazi party \u2014 referred to Jews, homosexuals and gypsies as harmful vermin. Rush Limbaugh \u2014 an American right wing pundit \u2014 referred to Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib as sub-human. Current Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte justi fies his extra-judicial slaughter of ghetto inhabitants by referring to them as \u201cdrug sc um\u201d. President Donald Trump is alleged to have referred to illegal immigrants as \u201c animals, not humans\u201d. The tactic of dehumanising the other \u2014 whether thro ugh graphic images that appear surreal in their brutality, or through demeaning la nguage \u2014 is fundamentally an effort to pacify the moral conscience of one\u2019s audience (b e that the electorate of a country or potential recruits for extremist groups). By presenting the enemy as filthy, dangerous, or su b-human, the hope is to generate sympathy for the brutality that will be levied agai nst them. Live-streaming slaughter, as in the New Zealand massacre, offers another elem ent of dehumanisation, as the live-streamed images become vaguely reminiscent of violent video games, thereby nullifying the gravity of the brutality. From Right Wing Populism to Toxic Populism The tactic of dehumanising the other (the out-group s) is a characteristic of extreme far right-wing populism. Populism is often understood a s political behaviour that is premised on representing the common people. But thi s understanding is deficient as all politicians seek to represent the people, but n ot all politicians are populists. Princeton political scientist, Jan-Werner Muller, a rgues that what distinguishes populists from other politicians is that populists present their agenda in \u2018moral\u2019 terms. To the extent that references to morality universal ly subdue, or even silent, our moral objections to violence and brutality, the populist tactic of moralising hatred and violence must be recognised as toxic for society. It is toxic precisely because in masquerading as ne cessary and moral, such rhetoric often succeeds in deflecting negative attention, al lowing hateful populists to go unabated at a significant human cost. Ultra right-wing white supremacist rhetoric of viol ent extremism, as a defensive measure against the racial and cultural pollution o f their societies by outsiders, is no different in its toxicity to Al-Qaeda\u2019s rhetoric of fighting for the rights of the \u2018ummah\u2019, or ISIS\u2019 rhetoric of the caliphate as the \u2018rightful\u2019 s ystem for the \u2018true\u2019 representation of Muslims. Populists who frame hateful narratives in terms of a morality are toxic precisely because in inciting violence and brutality, they be come a threat to the very people they claim to represent. The Desensitisation of Society The strategy of dehumanising others through demeani ng language or brutal imagery serves to desensitise the audience (the bystanders) , and thereby serves to normalise violence and brutality. The larger damage in this t actic is that it invariably generates an apathy vis-\u00e0-vis the racism and inhumanity of th e ultra right wing, and toxic populists amongst their audiences. The consequences of this are that the burden of pro of of both the inhumanity and immorality of right wing groups and movements comes to rest on the very victims of such policies and movements. This means that the ve ry people who are threatened by such violence are themselves burdened with the r esponsibility of whistle blowing. This only further serves to perpetuate brutality an d terrorism of ring wing groups and movements, as the targeted audience often becomes i ntimidated into silence. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY EUROPEANS ARE often quick to reserve the right to sanction third -party states on normative grounds. This happened again last week, when the latest round of European Union sanctions targeted the usual suspects, including Russia and Myanmar. What was new was that China has made it on to the EU sanctions list on human rights grounds for the first time since Tiananmen. With this, European institutions joined the United States and others, targeting four senior Chinese of ficials and one entity for human -rights violations in Xinjiang. Targeted Sanctions and Countersanctions The EU has an ambivalent relationship with China. There is an omnipresent power tussle among the EU institutions as well as among member states over the right balance between economic interests and normative imperatives, a struggle between national economic interests and the EU\u2019s normative global ambitions . Germany, for example , has long caused frustration among those in the EU who believe engagement with China should focus much more on questions such as human rights. This \u2018lobby\u2019 includes the more forward leaning member states and, importantly, the EU Parliament which largely s ees itself as Europe\u2019s normative guardian. Human rights abuses are serious and must receive international attention. But it is common wisdom that the efficacy of sanctions is low, perhaps counter -productive. In the EU, the primary objective of sanctions is, therefore, not an improvement inside the target country. Instead, sanctions are an instrument of public diplomacy, a symbol of international protest, and not least addressing domestic public opinion and appeasing political dynamics inside the EU. EU\u2019s First Dilemma: How to React Navigating the dilemma of having to react robustly without causing too much trouble for the sanctioned country is achieved by targeting a handful of lower -ranking individuals and entities with modest measures, including trav el bans and asset freezing. This way, the targeted country is only minimally affected, often not even worth a reaction. Not so this time. While EU officials would have expected a Chinese reaction, they had not expected Beijing lashing out as they did, with countersanctions on ten European individuals and four entities, including the EU Parliament\u2019s Subcommittee on Human Rights, parliamentarians (includin g the EU Parliament\u2019s greatest China critic, the prominent German Green -MEP B\u00fctikofer), diplomats and think tanks. Just like in Europe, Chinese sanctions are an instrument of public diplomacy. China is not a small developing country but a superpower, and Beijing cannot be seen as passively accepting international sanctions. A Dicey Investment Deal Germany\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel is its export driven economy and the automobile industry in particular. It is no surprise that German Chancellor Angela Merkel was in strumental in concluding the EU -China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI). This is an investment deal with which the EU hopes to level the hitherto asymmetric playing field for foreign businesses in China, long a serious concern in the EU, and Germany in particular. Many EU MEPs, B\u00fctikofer included, were critical of the other EU institutions\u2019 and CAI\u2019s ignorance towards poor human rights standards in China, including forced labour. And while Commission and Council can negotiate and approve the a greement, it is ultimately the EU Parliament that must give its consent for ratification. Parliamentarians cancelled a meeting to discuss the deal in protest over China\u2019s reaction. Of course, China must have predicted this reaction, leaving only one conc lusion: Beijing is signalling that they do not need to open up to the EU. EU\u2019s Second Dilemma: Two Losers, One Winner The EU now faces a dilemma. While Chinese sanctions are equally toothless, the difference to Brussels\u2019 sanctions is that Beijing\u2019s are clearly punitive, therefore highly confrontational. This audacity enraged MEPs, many of whom had already been critical of CAI, the Greens in particular. When the agreement now returns from \u201clegal scrubbing\u201d and official translation to Parliament for rati fication, Beijing\u2019s countersanctions jeopardise the outcome many national governments were hoping for. There is still time for intra -EU diplomacy to convince a critical number of MEPs to support CAI. Should the agreement be rejected, however, it will be E uropean industry that loses out, not China. And yet, the atmosphere in Beijing is barely festive. As is often the case, inept Chinese diplomacy is better at assembling a coaliti on of opponents than its actual opponents are. US-EU Anti -China Alliance? With its counter -sanctions Beijing has undermined its own objectives. With CAI, China attempted to drive a wedge between Washington and Europe, with success. Although the vast ma jority of European leaders eagerly awaited a \u201cnew beginning\u201d post-Trump, Europe threw Joe Biden a curveball by rushing through CAI just before his inauguration, instead of waiting to coordinate with Washington\u2019s new China policy. The White House reaction w as more than icy, leading to an early diplomatic tussle between Washington and European capitals. But EU -China relations are taking a nose -dive just as the new US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken arrived for his first official Europe visit. The tit -for-tat sanctions are a diplomatic manna for the US, and a stumbling block for those in China \u2014 and inside Europe \u2014 who argue that the EU should dissociate itself from Washington. For the foreseeable future, a united US -EU anti -China alliance is unlikely. Bu t Washington has done better than Brussels by delicately producing a \u2018frenemy\u2019 relationship with Beijing out of last week\u2019s Alaska talks. The unintended consequence of technically harmless EU sanctions show how easily diplomatic dynamics can spiral out of control, possibly with lasting impact on the global balance of power among Brussels, Beijing and Washington.

    "context": "Commentary ASEAN HAS long been an advocate of cyber confidence building measures (CBMs) for cyberspace; in 2014, and ASEAN was seen as a wo rld leader in Cyber CBMs. But ASEAN and its dialogue partners, like the ASEAN Reg ional Forum (ARF), have not moved past the diplomatic quagmire that has bogged down the development of CBMs. For example, a list of points of contact was mooted by ARF members as early as 2012 but has yet to see fruition due to objections from some members. Despite these obstacles, ASEAN still recognises the importance of cooperation and developing CBMs and norms in cyberspace. Singapore and Thailand, as the outgoing and incoming chairs of ASEAN, pledged to continue t he discussion on cybersecurity at the ASEAN summit in November 2018 to promote an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful ICT environment. This is se en as critical to connectivity and economic development. Challenges in Cyber Confidence Building Measures (C BMs) Just two months earlier, at Singapore International Cyber Week 2018, Singapore was tasked by the ASEAN Ministerial Conference on Cyber security (AMCC) to develop a framework for cooperation in cyberspace; confidence building measures among the various ASEAN member states will be needed for any cooperation to be successful. There are many challenges that need to be overcome in building this ASEAN-wide cooperation mechanism. Some ASEAN Member States hav e insufficient capacity to participate in cyber CBMs. For example, Myanmar\u2019s n ational Computer Emergency Response (MMCERT), has only five employees serving the cybersecurity needs of the whole country. In other ASEAN states, there is insufficient commun ication between the technology industry, government, academia, civil society, and the public. Companies are reluctant to report incidents because they fear loss of busin ess, or because reporting is too onerous; while governments are reluctant to share i nformation, which may be classified. This in turn hinders the free sharing o f information between countries. Sydney Recommendations for ASEAN CBMs Track II dialogues \u2013 or discussions involving acade mia, industry, and civil society \u2212 can smoothen this process of building confidence an d encouraging discussions for cyberspace. The writer was invited by the Australia n Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) to participate in a project that was part of the AS EAN-Australia Special Summit in March 2018 and supported by the Australia-ASEAN Cou ncil. The project was to suggest practical confidence bui lding measures in cyberspace in the ASEAN region that can be readily implemented. T his process brought together leading experts in international affairs and/or cyb er affairs from think-tanks, research institutes and universities from across the ASEAN r egion. The product of those discussions is The Sydney Recommendations on Practical Futures for Cyber Confidence Building in the ASEAN Region , which was launched in September 2018 at the Singapore International Cyber Week. CBMs that were raised range from the coordination o f planned and ongoing unclassified cyber activities, to professionalisati on of cyber capacity building efforts among ASEAN member states, and the expansion of ASE AN Computer Emergency Response Team Incident Drills (ACID). CBMs are gene rally undertaken to avert hostilities, minimise escalation of hostilities, an d build trust among states, which is sometimes in short supply in cyberspace. Role of Track II in ASEAN Cyber Discussions The Sydney Recommendations illustrate how Track II can contribute towards cyber cooperation in ASEAN. To maximise this contribution , ASEAN Track II needs to uplift its capabilities to better support Track I discussi ons. Under such circumstances, informal discussions by t hink-tanks and other non-state actors such as businesses and industry groups on Tr ack II should play an important role in helping move the discussion on regional cyb er cooperation forward. These discussions at Track II level should provide a non- threatening environment to discuss and informally advise the various governments on th e development of policies, how to carry out or recommend capacity building activities , and to understand the constraints that each state face. The formulation of the framework on ASEAN cyber coo peration needs to be a regional initiative that represents the ASEAN region. Singap ore has in the past facilitated Track II discussions among academia, civil society groups , and industry groups from within and outside the region. Examples are the Global Com mission on the Stability for Cyberspace (GCSC) and the Global Forum for Cyber Ex pertise (GFCE) to bring diverse views on how capacity can be built in cyber space. Paucity of Cyber Policy Discussions Even so, the Track II discussions surrounding the S ydney Recommendations show that ASEAN member states tend to prioritise the bui lding of technological capabilities such as infrastructural protection, threat detectio n and digital forensics; and place less priority on cyber policies and strategies. The pauc ity of cyber policy discussions at Track II level reflects this trend, and there is cu rrently a capacity deficit in cyber policy research at Track II in ASEAN. However, entities with more expertise, such as thin k tanks which are already working in this field, can contribute to building capacity in cyber policy at Track II for the region. If this is successful, Track II can support governm ents in creating the vibrant and stable cyber ecosystem laid out by ASEAN leaders. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY IN A hyper -connected world rocked by the Sino -US competition in 5G formats and allegations of digital snooping by Chinese and US tech companies, the Biden administration seems to think that democracy and democratisation unto cyberspace is the solution . However, all is not so clear cut. For one, doubling down on the reinforcement of democracy at home and abroad avoids a reassessment of how and to what extent democrac y in its current \u2014 usually Western \u2014 form is and is not fit for purpose in a digital age. Problematic Principles Whether in the United States, European Union (EU), or elsewhere, key data policy practices are modelled on democratic principles. Data shari ng and mobility within or across borders often hinges upon mechanisms of transparency and the protection of privacy as an individual right. Entities seeking access to data are legally obligated to provide notice of what data is collected and how it is us ed to garner consent. Legal redress of violated data rights is generally contingent upon individuals proving harm or injury towards their persons. But these approaches may not afford adequate data -related social protection, which is key to enabling trust . First, the gold standard of consent shifts the responsibility of data protection onto individuals, despite mounting evidence that such deputisation is a tall order . It is doubtful that the average person can keep track of all data exchanged, consent meaningfully when faced with complex legal language, or fully comprehe nd the workings of algorithms, for instance, even where simpler explanations are available. This insufficiency of transparency or openness may be especially problematic where populations have only recently come online or have lower data literacy. Second, data rights are individual rights but groups are increasingly harmed in the digital political economy. Policies backed by big data and algorithms are applied to groups for security and development purposes, such as racially discriminatory predictive polic ing (or analysing data to identify potential criminal activity). However, even if an entire collective is affected, it is generally harder for individuals to seek remedy for collective har m because they must prove that all members of that group suffered actual injury. Global Digital Governance: Different Mo dels The global digital economy may be increasingly split across different data governance models, with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) being most sensitive to digital protection. But leadership on these issues even across democracies can be flatfooted, if not lagging. The US still lacks a national privacy law and has ceded leadership in data policymaking, even if its companies are at the forefront of the digital revolution. This is to say nothing, moreover, of the anti -democratic global surveillance undertaken by the Five Eyes Intelligence Network and company. The EU, meanwhile, has attempted to finetune mechanisms of notice and consent, most recently via mandating fiduciary duties so data controllers act in an individual\u2019s best interests when handling their data. But when ill -defined and left in broad -brush terms, as in the case of l ast year\u2019s Digital Markets Act that seeks to govern online platforms, these can be broad concepts that leave wriggle room for abuse. Need for Inclusivity Data governan ce issues such as the aforementioned could be taken up within a close - knit circle of democratic allies, as the Biden administration\u2019s National Security Strategic Guidance seems to suggest. But it is questionable whether such discussions, though founded upo n discourses such as transparency, should be held exclusively. Therein lies another shortcoming. Putting aside complications in sorting the world into democratic versus non -democratic classes, many countries are grappling with digital and technology regu lation. While fundamental differences between data governance models exist, there are dimensions of convergence. China\u2019s 2020 draft privacy bill borrows noticeable elements from the GDPR. Consent t oo is a global best practice, and one that may not be future -proof in addition to providing inadequate data protection. Much consent is generated through screening texts, for instance, but this raises questions of operability in a world moving towards a screen -less Internet of Things. These are shared realities. Way Forward: Global Data Governance Body? There is thus space to establish an international institution dedicated to digital and data governance. Existing institutions like the World Trade Organisation, while dabbling in digital governance, ultimately touch upon specific disciplines such as e - commerce rather than broader rules on consent and rights underpinning the digital sphere. A new multilateral establishment would need the backing of economic heavyweights such as the US, Ch ina and the G20. However, it may be better served by highlighting leadership from more cyber -savvy small and middle powers such as Estonia and Singapore, rather than major powers per se. This would provide a forum for best practice sharing, though it wil l remain to be seen whether such multi -stakeholder talks will succour an appetite for tackling bigger obstacles to data sharing and accessibility. This includes the power asymmetries between state -society -market actors, which lie behind movements to contaminate the very data needed to harness technology effectively. Moreover, it could hold space for conversations on what the digital economy and data, as well as regulatory tools such as antitrust laws and data trusts, can and cannot do \u2014 and importantly, communicate that to the public. This would help manage expectations of what a gilded age of technology can and should reasonably deliver globally, there by pre -empting disenchantment and trust deficits in governing institutions. For instance, antitrust suits, while on the upswing, may not fundamentally shift business models of data rent seeking even if it breaks up oligopolies. Urgency in Post -Pandemic World These conversations are more urgent in a post -pandemic world where a reliance on technology co -exists with various concerns over how it is used an d to what end. There is, for instance, lingering angst over privacy, concentration of power in Big Tech, and the need to contextualise Western technology for non -Western contexts. An inclusive multilateral approach will not necessarily reverse all trends towards international regulatory divergence. Still, it could keep a channel of communication open for standard -setting cooperation amidst a sea of otherwise competitive and adversarial technology issues \u2014 something that a democracy -only approach cannot do. In the spirit of democracy, it would also show that Washington is listening to the majority of countries \u2014 allies included \u2014 who baulk at choosing sides and seek a less polarised world, even as they find themselves at odds with different systems of governance.

    "context": "COMMENTARY AFTER DECADES of increasing globalisation that brought economic prosperity worldwide, signs of deglobalisation emerged after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in 2008. COVID -19 has amplified this trend. How serious is the situation and is globalisation dead? Globalisation has many components: cross -border flows of trade, investment, finance, people including migrant workers and tourists, data, and digital technology. Over the years, it has led to closer economic integration at the global level. One way to assess how integrated the global economy has become is to focus on the global trade openness rat io. Defined as the sum of world exports and imports divided by world GDP, it is regarded as a reasonable and commonly -used proxy for global economic integration. Globalisation 1.0 : The First of Four Phases During the past one and a half century, globalisat ion has passed through four phases (figure below).  Globalisation 1.0 refers to the period 1870 -1913 when the world was on the gold standard. During this period exchange rates of currencies were fixed to gold which in turn was freely mobile across count ries. Central banks were also not permitted to intervene in currency markets. Strict observance of these rules contributed to monetary stability and the global trade openness ratio increased from 17.6% to 29% during this period. Deglobalisation 1.0 During the Inter -War period, or Deglobalisation 1.0, the global trade openness ratio fell sharply from 29% in 1913 to 10% in 1945.After 1913, countries abandoned the gold standard to pursue independent monetary policies in order to finance World War I (WW I). Abs ence of rules and regulations led to chaos and instability. Russia withdrew from the world trading system after the communist revolution of 1917. The United Kingdom attempted to go back to the gold standard but it was unsuccessful. Subsequently, countrie s adopted \u201cbeggar thy neighbour\u201d policies. For example, in the early 1930s, the United States, UK, and France resorted to competitive currency devaluations. These tit -for-tat policies partially contributed to the Great Depression of the 1930s when the volu me of international trade halved and world output fell by 15%. The League of Nations was founded after WW I to promote peace. But it failed to prevent WW II and was replaced by the United Nations in 1946. Globalisation 2.0 After World War II (WW II), p olicymakers in the US realised that they alone could lead global affairs. Hence at the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944 the US helped establish the rules -based world economic order comprising the IMF (for monetary stability), the GATT and its successor the World Trade Organisation (WTO) (for open trading environment) and the World Bank (for poverty reduction). Rules set by these global economic institutions ushered in the Golden Age of Globalisation when world trade expanded several times faster than worl d output. Global supply chain trade comprising trade in parts and components also started to gather pace after the Information and Communications Technology revolution of the 1980s. During this phase, Globalisation 2.0, the world trade openness ratio inc reased six-fold from 10% in 1945 to 60% to 2008. Deglobalisation 2.0 Globalisation was a key driver of the world economy for much of the post - WWII period. But this stopped after the global economic crisis in 2008. Global supply chains which accounted for about 50% of world also ceased expanding. Deglobalisation 2.0 started to set in for a number of reasons: First, the slow economic recovery after the GFC led to rising nationalism and protectionism in the Western world and eventually elsewher e. Under the former president Donald Trump, the US embraced the \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy and protectionism shifting away from trade liberalisation of the past. Tariffs were imposed on about 20% of total imports of the US mainly from China. The US also soug ht to disband China -centered supply chains. Similarly, European countries also initiated policy actions to protect their economies especially from rising inflows of migrant workers from the Middle East. Countries around the world retaliated and became mo re inward -looking. Although it remains an export powerhouse, China has turned inwards to some extent. Since 2020, India has also adopted a more self -reliant policy. COVID -19\u2019s Impact on Globalisation Second , COVID -19 affected globalisation in several way s. Because of the lockdowns, international trade and tourism \u201cfell off the cliff\u201d during the second quarter of 2020. Although the volume of world trade has rebounded more strongly than expected since then, the March 2021 forecast from the WTO expects a 5.3% fall in 2020. COVID -19 also disrupted global supply chains as intermediate products could not be transported with ease between production blocks located in different parts of the world. COVID -19 laid bare the risks of relying on complex \u201cjust in time\u201d value chains and raised awareness of the need to diversify sources and shorten global supply chains by onshoring, near -shoring, and sourcing regionally rather than globally. Many countries also questioned their dependence on import of essential medical equipment (e.g., PPEs) and medical supplies of which they might be deprived in an emergency. They, therefore, imposed temporary export bans. Third , since the mid -2010s, national security has become a crucial cause of the deterioration in US -China relations and trade. It is argued that China\u2019s accession to the WTO in 200 1 has led to a large negative impact on US manufacturing. China\u2019s presumed systematic practice of industrial and cyber -espionage has also led to stiff tariffs and bans on China\u2019s acquisition of US technology. Fourth , the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiation has been stalled since 2008. In its stead regional trading agreements have proliferated. When will Deglobalisation End? Is globalisation dead? No, it is not dead, but it is in a partial retreat. When will the retreat be over? It is difficult to say precisely but it may take some time for protectionist sentiments around the world to turn around and for national security concerns in the US vis -a-vis China to abate. But Deglobal isation 2.0 will probably be milder and less disruptive than Deglobalisation 1.0 which lasted for about 30 years and when the global trade openness ratio fell by nearly 13 percentage points. This time around the ratio has fallen much less, by only about th ree percentage points \u2013 so far. ",

    "context": "Commentary THE 48th SESSION of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-48) held in early October 2018 released a summary repor t for policymakers highlighting that the Earth may get warmer by 1.5\u00b0C above pre-in dustrial level anytime between 2030 and 2050. The report further demonstrates that while a temperature increase of 1.5\u00b0C will result in more hot days and extreme heat events, changes in rain patterns and volume, biodiversity loss, increase in ocean te mperature and acidity, decrease in oxygen levels, and bring negative impacts on health , food security, water supply, human security and economic growth, letting it rise further to 2\u00b0C will cause even more catastrophic outcomes. The emphasis on 1.5\u00b0C and comparison to 2\u00b0C are mod elled after the 2015 Paris Agreement that aims to \u201ckeeping a global temperatur e rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Ce lsius.\u201d The report, therefore, provides a review of the current status of global e mission pathways pertaining to the 1.5\u00b0C goal. The final message is then clear: the Ea rth potentially has only 12 years left before hitting the 1.5\u00b0C mark; as such, countr ies must urgently make concerted efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ensu re that global warming does not go beyond it thereafter. Implications on Southeast Asia Although this latest report may sound alarming, the consequences of a changing climate have been reported years back. In its regio nal assessment report published in 2014, the IPCC has identified that the temperature in Southeast Asia has risen since the 1960s, and there are more hot days and warm nig hts and less cool weather now. It also rains more although the pattern varies acro ss different regions and seasons. Furthermore, the changing climate will lead to drou ght in lowland, biodiversity loss, wildfires and smoke exposure, sea surface temperatu re increase, and dengue outbreaks. Among all, flooding poses the biggest cl imate risk in Southeast Asia. This is consistent with the reality on the ground. In th e last two decades, climate-related disaster events especially floods and storms made u p the most frequent and the most devastating disasters in Southeast Asia. Since 1998 , floods and storms have affected close to 250 million people and incurred a total co st of about US$89billion in the region. Except for the shortening window gap, therefore, th e warnings that come with the 1.5\u00b0C report do not really come as a big surprise. In fact, the earlier-than-expected attainment of the 1.5\u00b0C limit is also hardly surpri sing. The Climate Tracker Action noted that emissions pathway based on the Nationally Dete rmined Contributions (NDCs) pledge submitted as of November 2017 has 90% likeli hood to exceed 2\u00b0C by 2100. Similarly, although climate change-related policies and regulations have exploded exponentially throughout the globe from 60 in the 1 997 to more than 1,200 in early 2017 (Grantham Research Institute 2017), policy pat hways have 97% likelihood of going beyond 2\u00b0C by 2100. As such, at the current g oing rate from the time the 2015 Paris Agreement was signed, the world is already pr ojected to miss the 2\u00b0C mark at the end of the century. Most Climate-Vulnerable States in the World The expansion of climate change laws and policies a lso took place in Southeast Asia. At the international level, all Southeast Asian cou ntries are signatories of the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Chan ge (UNFCCC), the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and the 2015 Paris Agreement. At the regional level, a common attitude towards climate change is reflected in the Declarat ion on ASEAN Post-2015 Environmental Sustainability and Climate Change Age nda. At the national level, countries have put in place relevant policies and laws for green growth and sustainable development targeting carbon -emitting sectors including energy, transportation, and land use. This is despi te Southeast Asia emitting only about 7.7% of total global carbon emission in 2014 (CAIT Climate Data Explorer 2018). Southeast Asian countries have also formulated clim ate adaptation policies and action plans. Although they have identified vulnerable sec tors and segments of society and included measures to increase resilience in the fac e of climate change, some Southeast Asian countries are still regarded as the most climate vulnerable states in the world. According to the 2017 German Watch report, Myanmar, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Thailand ranked the third, fifth, eighth and ninth among the top 10 countries having the highest long-term climate risk index measured f rom 1997 to 2016. This implies that much more needs to be done to achieve societal adap tation and resilience against the fast rising global temperature. More Ambitious Policy Needed The 1.5\u00b0C summary report that the UN Secretary-Gene ral Antonio Guterres referred to as \u201can ear-splitting wake-up call to the world\u201d prescribes some recipes including, among others, a major and sweeping overhaul in ener gy, land, urban and infrastructure (including transport and building) a nd industrial system that result in emission reductions by 2030. The IPCC advises that this is technically possible but it needs to happen sooner than later because the costs of doing so will only get much more prohibitive if it starts later. This prescription is, again, nothing quite new. The numerous green growth plans and climate mitigation policies and regulations across Southeast Asia have incorporated this approach in various ways. The more critical qu estions will then be: have they been fully implemented and are they sufficient? More amb itious and aggressive climate mitigation policies and actions may be needed to sa ve the Earth from getting warmer too much too soon. Similarly, as the consequences of the changing clim ate are certain, more ambitious and aggressive climate adaptation policies and acti ons are needed to save the population and the environment from climate-induced disasters. Will the 1.5\u00b0C summary report generate the desired reactions from relevant parties, particularly the governments? ",

    "context": "Commentary LAST WEEK, the world\u2019s financial leaders convened t he annual IMF-World Bank meeting in Bali, Indonesia on 12-14 October 2018. O n the sidelines, Southeast Asian leaders held an informal gathering among themselves a day earlier, on 11 October. While these meetings involved different players, on e thing in common was discussions on sustainable development (SD). SD is defined as \u201cdevelopment that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to m eet their own needs\u201d. In other words, development for the current generation but n ot at the expense of the future generation. Such development has been the guiding p rinciple for countries to \u201cachieve, in a balanced manner, economic developmen t, social development and environmental protection\u201d. Why is SD Crucial for ASEAN? At the Bali IMF-World Bank gathering, the Secretary -General of the United Nations Ant\u00f3nio Guterres highlighted high debt situations i n some countries as a factor of concern; it could diminish governments\u2019 ability to utilise funds to fulfil their other domestic needs and finance programmes to achieve th e objectives outlined in the UN\u2019s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Incidentally, the ASEAN Leaders\u2019 meeting was themed \u201cAchieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and Overcoming the Developm ent Gap Through Regional and Global Collaborative Actions\u201d. The Southeast As ian nations stressed ASEAN\u2019s achievements in realising the Agenda 2030 and discu ssed the remaining challenges facing the SD. Along with the IMF and World Bank, Southeast Asian states see SD as crucial for themselves on several accounts. First, countries embarking on development schemes c an eventually suffer a trade deficit which may require them to borrow hard curre ncies from the IMF to help its economy. For instance, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor required Pakistan to import machinery to build it. Within the first two years of construction, Islamabad witnessed a 50% increase in its trade deficit, pres suring its government to ask for the Fund\u2019s bailout. Second, development initiatives are utilised by pow erful states as part of their power contestation game. In Southeast Asia, look no furth er than the Mekong sub-region in which China, Japan, and the US compete via their sc hemes \u2013 Lancang-Mekong Cooperation, Japan-Mekong Cooperation, and Lower Me kong Initiative, respectively \u2013 to gain influence in this area. In addition, nations\u2019 pursuit of economic developme nt may cripple their ability to pay back their loans. Sri Lanka, Kenya, Djibouti, Kyrgy zstan, and Mongolia, and Laos are among the examples. This debt condition can ultimately jeopardise their sovereignty as reflected by the fact that Sri Lanka granted a 99-year lease of its Hamba ntota Port to China, its lender. Therefore, if ASEAN economies do not want to find t hemselves in the same situations, they must take SD seriously and step up their effor t to take a lead in SD collaboration by being rule-makers, not rule-takers. Enhancing ASEAN SD Leadership There is evidence that Southeast Asian nations are pursuing such leadership. They are planning to launch the ASEAN Centre for Sustain able Development Studies and Dialogue (ACSDSD) next year. The Centre is to serve as an institutional mechanis m facilitating collaboration on SD in the region. The entity is expected to execute ta sks ranging from supporting the implementation of projects and fostering dialogues between ASEAN and its development partners. ACSDSD can enhance ASEAN leadership in SD collabora tion because it can provide discussion platforms by summoning ASEAN member stat es and development partners to meet and exchange views regarding devel opment. Moreover, the Centre can enable Southeast Asian eco nomies to have a say in project design and implementation, and align their developm ent partners\u2019 approaches with ASEAN\u2019s commitments to the UN\u2019s Agenda 2030. The entity can also address any issue of uncoordina ted support by different players rendering certain programmes to be overfunded while others are underfunded. In addition, ACSDSD can help ensure that projects are executed in ways that uphold ASEAN\u2019s standards in terms of transparency and bein g environment-friendly. Step in Right Direction, But\u2026 While the idea to establish ACSDSD is a step in the right direction, more needs to be done. Most importantly, ASEAN leaders must devise a n effective ACSDSD that is able to pool resources from different sectors and facili tate cooperation among different mechanisms. It is because SD is multi-faceted and c ross-sectoral which requires the Centre to collaborate with different entities. For example, to ensure that development programmes do not harm the environment, ACSDSD must cooperate with the ASEAN Working Group on Nature Conservation and Biodiversity. Also, to come up with a monitorin g system of states\u2019 debts stemming from their pursuit of economic development, the Cen tre must work with ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO). How can such multi-faceted and cross-sectoral colla boration be realised? Answers can be extracted from ASEAN\u2019s past experiences and practices. For instance, the ASEAN Coordinating Committee on C onnectivity (ACCC) has assumed a brokerage role by screening projects prof fered by external actors, and moving financial and other resources from certain a reas to those needing greater assistance. Moreover, the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanit arian Assistance on Disaster Management (AHA Centre) has successfully coordinate d efforts of various players ranging from non-ASEAN states, international organi sations, and private sector to execute disaster relief missions. Lessons learned f rom these cases can be applied to the design of ACSDSD\u2019s mandates and legal framework s which can enable this entity to effectively provide ASEAN leadership in SD coope ration. But while ASEAN\u2019s plans to establish ACSDSD is time ly, whether the Centre will be formed in a way that helps ASEAN provide leadership in SD collaboration remains to be seen. Southeast Asian policymakers should apply the lessons learned from ASEAN\u2019s past experiences and practices to craft the Centre\u2019s mandates and legal frameworks. Doing so will enable this entity to eff ectively work with different sectors as well as facilitate collaboration among different mechanisms, hence providing ASEAN leadership in SD cooperation. ",

    "context": "Commentary IN THE past year, Asia\u2019s food systems which link th e farmer to the consumer, have been described as \u201csick\u201d and \u201cneed to be fixed\u201d by academic and industry leaders. A recent report Separate Tables: Bringing together Asia\u2019s food syst ems by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) released on 3 Sep tember 2018 affirmed this. It identified six megatrends affecting Asia\u2019s food sys tems \u2013 urbanisation, changing diets, malnutrition, differential adoption of technology, food standards and food politics. Trade was named as one way to overcome some of the challenges posed by these trends. As a region, Asia does not produce enough food now or is it expected to do so in the foreseeable future, according to the Food and Agric ulture Organisation (FAO). So trade through the geographically-dispersed supply c hains which typify current food systems has been the main means for Asia to meet th is deficit. Any disruption along these supply chains affects food security. Trade Tensions and Food Disruptions The ongoing \u201ctit-for-tat\u201d tariffs between countries could shift the points of origin for commodity supply chains such as those of soybean. O ne case in point is China\u2019s plan to levy a 25% tariff on imports of US soybeans, an important feed to produce hogs, chicken and fish. In 2016, the top five soybean exp orting countries, all from the Americas (United States, Brazil, Argentina, Canada and Paraguay), together accounted for 94% of the world\u2019s volume of availabl e soybeans. China is the world\u2019s largest soybean importer and i n 2016 imported US$34 billion of global soybeans or two-thirds of global supply. Wit h American soybeans potentially costing more to Chinese importers, the US may be gi ving up market share to other producers like Brazil and Argentina. So other large soybean importers like Japan, South Korea and Indonesia may benefit from a potent ial drop in US soybean prices if supply there exceeds demand from its traditional la rgest importer. But Asia\u2019s demand for food and feed items is not li mited to soybean. In the 2017/2018 trade period, Indonesia has been predicted by the U S Department of Agriculture to become the world\u2019s largest wheat importer, at about 15 million tonnes! Asia is also a large importer of maize even though the region itse lf is a large producer in terms of area planted. Sorting Out Asia\u2019s Food Insecurity The world is strongly dependent on surplus food pro duction in the Americas and Australasia to maintain global food security balanc es. Not coincidentally, these regions practice industrialised, technology-based farming o n a large scale when compared to Asia\u2019s mainly smallholder food farming which, accor ding to the EIU, currently under- utilises modern technologies. This is particularly the case in the three Asian giants \u2013 China, India and Indonesia. So a bigger question has to be asked: what are the implications for the region of trade conflict between food exporting and food importing countries? Governments need to re-examine their approaches to ensuring national fo od security and adopt a balance between achieving limited self sufficiency and part ial reliance on imports. There are no inherent contradictions between desiri ng some level of food self- sufficiency and food importation, as countries like Singapore have shown. Singapore has consistently been rated by the EIU Global Food Security Index as one of the most food secure countries in the world despite importin g 90% of its food. In a perfect world, unfettered trade will move food between producers a nd consumers and an overall increase in production means more will be available for trade. To achieve some level of self-sufficiency, governme nts and the private sector will need to address the many well-researched issues \u0336 small farm size, low productivity, under- exploited use of technology, declining rural popula tions, agriculture\u2019s declining contribution to GDP and contradictory government po licy. Both the EIU and FAO reports noted similar trends a nd highlighted that Asia\u2019s fragmented food systems means that solutions must a lso address the needs of the smallholder farming predominant in Asia (87% of the world\u2019s smallholder farm population). Some optimism may be drawn from the su ccess stories in Asia; this region is already the world\u2019s top producer of many food it ems, from rice to vegetable oil to fish. So can such successes be repeated for other food items? Pro-Activating the Future: Mega-Solutions for Megat rends? Asian governments need to increase their investment s in research, technology transfer and extension services to boost farm produ ction by small farmers. These can go a long way to address the so-called megatrends i n food systems and Asia\u2019s fragmentation. The 3 September 2018 EIU report proposed some mega- solutions to the six challenges: considering food security in a more hol istic manner; anticipating the convergence of trends to set appropriate policy; im proving national capacity to monitor food system performance; and involving the private sector through more directed business strategies. Addressing the urbanisation phenomenon and the rela ted decline in farmers is not just about making farming more lucrative. It is about ma king rural living more attractive because as long as rural communities suffer a livin g standard difference from urban communities because of access to amenities like goo d schools and income gaps, the rural to urban migration will continue. At least four of the EIU report\u2019s megatrends can al so be tackled by cities developing urban farming with technology-enabled agriculture. This is a fast growing industry in the US, China, Japan, Korea and even Singapore wher e proximity to consumers, creative use of space for plant factories which buf fer against variable weather, is helping to feed cities with fresh vegetables. Assuring food security in the future will further r equire that Asian countries start putting in place policies and action to reduce food waste a nd moderate the rate of loss of land and water resources for food production. The rise o f agtech (agricultural technology) and fintech (financial technology) in Asia will hel p accelerate progress in all three by making new technologies and information accessible to small farmers. Finally, as I have said in an earlier commentary, a \u201cGlocal\u201d (Think Global, Act Local) approach is needed to address the connectivity betw een mega-trends and action solutions at local levels.

    "context": "Commentary IN SOUTHEAST Asia, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) has emerged as a central co ncern of the states of the region and of regional organisations and frameworks. This has been the result of both \u2018natural\u2019 disasters and more complex humanitarian crises. Similarly in peacekeeping, an increased focus on protecting civilians and providing h umanitarian assistance is shaping the types of training for peacekeepers in the region. The relationship between these two sets of activities in Southeast Asia  \u0336 those responding to humanitarian and natural disasters  \u0336 are often the same people who are peacekeepers; the region has an opportunity to develop expertise and capacities in providing rapid responses. However, both of these forms of assistance present a potential risk to populations that are being protected or assisted because of the inheren t power imbalance between those giving and receiving assistance. Power Imbalance? In both of these developments, gradual and incremental approaches to developing patterns of practical coordination, rather than strategic and policy -driven coordination can be seen. Across these two areas (humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, and p eacekeeping) there are opportunities to draw on the expertise garnered from operations and to seek to coordinate between civilian and military providers in generating responses to a range of disasters. Furthermore, there is also an opportunity to inform an increasingly global debate, through the practices of the region. A fundamental challenge for the region is not only how to develop and enhance intra - regional coordination but also to ensure extra -regional engagements are effective, efficient, timely, are cognizant of regional realities, and protect both the humanitarian worker and the vulnerable population. It is timely consider questions of oversight, governance, and regulations that provide operational frameworks for relief. What Level Coordinati on? Practices of coordination proceed at two -levels: policies and operations. Policies concerns the development of ideas and concepts that shape the way operations should happen. These norms then guide and inform what practices states pursue when respond ing to specific crises. Operational cooperation is focused on the practices and governance; when operations are undertaken at this level the focus of coordination is chiefly about the delivery of the response. Within Southeast Asia responses are centere d on practical help; this ensures the disaster responses are effective and efficient. Moreover, they try to develop a governance structure capable of coordinating this practical help in a crisis. In particular, the One ASEAN, One Response policy, is a key demonstration of the effort and ingenuity of the region in seeking to coordinate around issues of disaster management. Similarly, the AHA Centre (ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance in disaster management) has developed mechanisms for disaster monitoring and response. This is a standby arrangement (including the Emergency Response and Assessment Team \u2013 ERAT, and stockpiling of relief items). There are also some standing operating procedures known as SASOP (Standard Operating Procedur e for Regional Standby Arrangements and Coordination of Joint Disaster Relief and Emergency Response Operations). This is to guide the responses and ensure they are coordinated in the event of any incidents. How Useful? These are all innovative and im portant steps. Nonetheless, the details and appropriateness of these guidelines raises some questions as to how useful they will be in a disaster setting. For example, in the SASOP, the AHA Centre will coordinate with the United Nations in the event of dis aster management. It will make use of the UN Virtual On -Site Operations and Coordination centre, and will coordinate with \u2013 when necessary - the UN Disaster Assessment Coordination team, to assist in reporting and requesting processes. Indeed, the SASOP makes clear the need for further work on these guidelines. The AHA Centre shall make arrangements with the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\u2019 (OCHA) field coordination Support Section (FCSS) to extend help to the local authorities. Hence, despite these regional innovations, there remain significant gaps between the policy creation and the operational practice. In effect the vague guidance in the policies results in a lack of sufficient clarity necessary for consistent and coherent operational responses, leading to ad hoc responses. In consequence, the link between policy and practices needs further deepening so that the policies provide sufficient detail to  guide  the interaction between different helpers; especially between regio nal organisations and global contributors \u2013 deepening these policies should ensure that  coordination and predictability of responses remains becomes less ad hoc. Who Responds? In the hydroelectric dam disaster in Laos in July 2018, a number of problems have been identified which relate to the causes but also to the provision of assistance. In the case of responders across Southeast Asia, the armed forces tend to be the first responders to natural disasters, but their efforts are also complemented and augmented by NGOs and charities. This was seen in the responses to Super Typhoon Yolanda in Philippines, in the latest responses to the earthquake in Indonesia and in the provisio n of assistance following the collapse of the dam in Laos. Responses by militaries can be professional and efficient, but they are also limited or hampered by poor information and coordination on the ground, particularly across military -to-civilian, and civilian -to-civilian (as represented by NGO and charities -to government) interactions. As can be seen in the evaluations of the Super Typhoon Yolanda, the coordination between aid agencies and the Philippine military were problematic in getting assistance to those in need. Similarly, in the limited transfer of information between Laos and Cambodia, there is evidence to claim that although the regional platforms are in place they need to be more developed. In particular, these developments need to be at t he policy level. Furthermore, in light of the challenges of coordination, militaries may appear to be a more appropriate responder in some instances, and would limit the coordination problems. What is perhaps needed is a greater critical reflection about w ho should respond, when and under what guiding principles and frameworks. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY TWO EGYPTIAN nationals and a Filipino were killed o n 5 November 2019 in Indanan, Sulu for an attempted suicide bombing. Two suicide vests loaded with explosives, detonators, a loaded pistol, and a grenade were seized from the dead attackers . This suggests that only two of the three perpetrators we re prepared to be suicide bombers, and a question mark remains as to whether the sole Filipino was one of the two. The Egyptians went by the aliases of Abduramil and Yusop. It was also noted that Abduramil\u2019s wife, Reda Mohamad Mahmud Mohamad, was the suicide bomber at a military checkpoint on 8 September 2019 which faile d to cause any fatalities. This attack came shortly after the death of Abu Bakr al- Baghdadi, the self-declared caliph of the self-proclaimed Islamic State (IS), on 31 Oc tober 2019. Trend of Suicide Bombings Al-Baghdadi\u2019s symbolic death by suicide bombing ser ves as propaganda of the deed , potentially encouraging sympathisers to \u201cmartyr\u201d th emselves as he did. Coupled with the failing \u201ccaliphate\u201d in Syria after IS lost its final stronghold in Syria on 23 March 2019, it is assessed that foreign fighters are expe cted to relocate into another conflict theatre, such as the Philippines. Two theories to the localisation of suicide terrori sm in the Philippines have been forwarded: the active recruitment of foreign suicide bombers and the local adoption of the tactic. Currently, the former assessment has be en more proven as locals continue to resist the adoption of suicide bombing, going by the overwhelming foreign profile of suicide bombers in the country thus far. To date, there are five suicide bombing attempts/at tacks in the Philippines starting from the unintended Basilan Vehicle-Borne Improvise d Explosive Device (VBIED) attack on 31 December 2018 which killed 10 and wounded 7. This was a serendipitous moment for Hajan Sawadjaan \u2013 leader of IS Sulu and mooted emir of IS Philippines \u2013 as he recruited two members of the Indonesia-based Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) shortly after for a suicide attack which killed 22 and wounded more than 100 at the Our Lady of Mount Carmel Cathedral. Based on those involved in suicide attacks in the c ountry, it appears that suicide bombings still heavily rely on foreign terrorist fi ghters. Today, while there have been eight individuals who conducted or attempted suicid e bombings in the Philippines, only one Filipino was identified as a suicide attacker. The culture of upholding the honour of the warrior \u2013 to die during fighting \u2013 among ind igenous Moro tribes in Mindanao may have prevailed thus far to resist the perceived glory of suicide \u201cmartyrdom\u201d. Moreover, the five suicide bombing attacks and atte mpts demonstrated that the adoption of this tactic is contained within the Sul u region; four attacks were conducted on Jolo island. These tactics are only actively pur sued by IS Sulu which operates in the Sulu archipelago; not within mainland Mindanao. In contrast, recent attacks launched by the Maguidanao-based Turaife-led factio n of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) still favour remotely deton ated bombs. Trajectory of Suicide Bombings We can expect more attempts to introduce suicide bo mbings along the Sulu Archipelago. However, if local resistance to the ad option of suicide bombings persists, IS Sulu may step up the recruitment of foreign mili tants into Mindanao if it intends to make suicide bombings a staple in their arsenal. Th is would allow them to dispense high casualty attacks through foreign suicide bombe rs while maintaining their trained local fighting force to defend their territorial sa nctuaries. The Sulu route is one of many foreign militants use to travel into Mindanao . It is preferred as smuggling through that route is relati vely not difficult. The porous border and troubled waters between Malaysian East Sabah an d the Philippines\u2019 Sulu islets create opportunities for human smuggling into Minda nao. Hence, IS Sulu\u2019s mere presence in that region differentiates them from th e other militant groups in Southeast Asia as they are able to actively smuggle foreign m ilitants. This was observed when Indonesian militants Rullie Rian Zeke and Ulfah Handayani Saleh who conducted the Jolo Church suicide attack, were smuggled through East Sabah by IS Sulu. This route is also used by non-regional foreign fighters who see Malaysia as a transit between the Middle East and S outhern Philippines. Coupled with the potential relocation of foreign fi ghters from Syria after IS lost its territory and leader, the IS East Asia Wilayat (ie. Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Myanmar, and Japan) could beco me one of the recipients of fighters from Syria. Bids to recruit deportees who attempted to fight in Syria and returnees would pose a serious threat to the securi ty of the Sulu archipelago. Sharing of Intelligence Given the trend, it is critical that the Philippine s government adopt a comprehensive set of policies to harden its borders. This include s intelligence sharing mechanisms which leverages on transnational arrangements to de ny entrance of foreign fighters. Proposals to expand the Trilateral Cooperative Arra ngement (TCA) \u2013 joint patrols between the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia at the Sulu-Celebes Seas \u2013 to improve force coordination and intelligence sharing should be considered. Key also is to monitor the movements of foreign fighters who ha d fought in Syria and are now eyeing their next battle-ground. Initiatives to coordinate with the Turkish governme nt and other intelligence platforms such as the \u201c Five Eyes \u201d could also be considered to monitor and deter pos sible relocation of foreign fighters to the Philippines. Ultimately, terrorism is a transnational threat whi ch requires a transnational arrangement. Governments must create more platforms for cooperation and intelligence sharing to interdict its transnational networks effectively. This would then allow respective governments to manage and contain the threat locally. ",

    "context": "Commentary NEARLY A year after the Battle for Marawi ended, Ph ilippine President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s martial law over Mindanao has not fully a ddressed the threat posed by other Islamic State-linked groups. Manila continues to gr apple with the challenges of countering violent extremism (CVE). A series of bom bings in Sultan Kudarat, North Cotabato, and South Cotabato by members of the Bang samoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) underscore the gaps in kinetic mili tary approaches. ASEAN was quick to act when the fighting erupted in Marawi. Singapore was one of the first countries to send in humanitarian supplie s to the beleaguered city. Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines put into place joint, trilateral border patrols to prevent the spread of armed conflict. Aside from dealing wi th the consequences of the Marawi siege, Southeast Asian countries cooperated closely in sharing knowledge to confront violent extremist groups. The ASEAN defence ministe rs have been discussing the establishment of the \u201cOur Eyes\u201d Initiative that see ks to institutionalise further pre- existing intelligence sharing mechanisms. Winning the War After Battle Winning the war after the battle is a familiar refr ain for those looking at post-conflict scenarios from Mosul to Marawi. The ruins of what w as once the commercial heart of Marawi stand testament to the long-term disruption posed by violent extremism. The razing of dozens of mosques and madrasahs in Marawi imperils the city\u2019s status as the Philippines\u2019 centre for Islamic learning. Delayed reconstruction of the city would only lead to resentment and create the wellspring for terrorist narratives in the future. The military defeat of the Maute Group and its IS-linked allies in Marawi is only the firs t step in rebuilding the city. Information operations by the Philippine military c omplemented its combat operations during the Battle for Marawi. Confronting terrorist ideologies online denied IS-linked groups full control of the informational space. Par tnerships with major social media companies and other states led to the systematic ta kedown of harmful content. Communities of Practice Against Other \u201cExtremisms\u201d As communities of practice emerge around CVE initia tives, there is recognition among stakeholders in the security sector, civil society organisations (CSOs), and academia of the complex policy environment. Growing polarisa tion within states can lead to the emergence of other potential \u201cextremisms\u201d aside fro m the brand of violence associated with the so-called Islamic State and oth er resurgent groups such as Al Qaeda. This is apparent in ASEAN, which has witnessed the continuation of sectarian violence. Violence has come from a broad range of a ctors from inchoate nationalist movements to secessionist groups. Rather than a fixation with counter-narratives, the re is an emerging consensus that CVE has more in common with non-securitised digital literacy and public education programmes. Southeast Asian youths remain vulnerabl e to recruitment by violent extremist groups. Developing critical thinking skil ls especially among the youth may lead to benefits beyond the CVE realm. Life skills that help inoculate against violent ideologies are also relevant in mitigating the effe cts of deliberate online falsehoods or information operations by hostile parties. Unfortunately, there is an uneven distribution of g overnment capacities to pursue holistic CVE among ASEAN member-states. One way to level the playing field is to share lessons learned and identify gaps, through ev ents such as the upcoming counter-terrorism symposium to be held in Singapore in October 2018 organised by the S.Rajaratnam School of International Studies (R SIS) and the government. ASEAN\u2019s Potential Contributions to CVE ASEAN\u2019s push to create a resilient and networked co mmunity of peoples could manifest with states acting as enablers for joint i nitiatives. ASEAN\u2019s long record of accomplishment in fostering Track 1.5 and Track 2 i nitiatives would mean not having to reinvent the wheel in terms of harnessing the ef forts of states and CSOs. CSOs have a better grasp of \u2018ground truth\u2019 while states have access to resources to build inclusive CVE programmes. Beyond upstream efforts to inoculate vulnerable pop ulations from violent extremism, ASEAN can help bring needed quality-of-life improve ments in Mindanao. The recent signing of the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) is expe cted to bring meaningful political and economic autonomy to Filipino Muslims . The BOL\u2019s success rests on the ability of local elected officials to take the lead in bringing progress to their communities. Given the uneven levels of local governance in Mind anao, ASEAN can help tip the scales by focusing on capacity-building programmes. Addressing the socioeconomic roots of conflict in Mindanao is of course a long-t erm project. However, its benefits go beyond dissipating the sources of rage that violent extremists tap into for their radicalisation activities. Gaining valuable experience in promoting good gover nance could pay dividends even in non-security issues across Southeast Asia. Econo mic and political development forges stronger communal bonds. This could help ste m the increasing appeal of populist politics and the intolerance it breeds wit hin states. Multilateral security mechanisms should just be the start of holistic CVE efforts. Across ASEAN, national-level best practices can be found, involving either or both states and non-state entities. The challenge lies in taking wh at works from one country and adapting it to suit local conditions in another cou ntry. Adversaries like IS are continually evolving, seeki ng to exploit emerging technologies and building their own illicit networks. States and their partners, whether technology firms or CSOs, need to adapt quicker. The destructi on wrought by IS-linked militants in Marawi is a cautionary example of what happens w hen drivers of conflict are not systematically addressed and security services beco me complacent.

    "context": "Commentary AN INDUSTRIAL device containing radioactive materia l reported missing by Malaysian authorities on 20 August 2018 is a remind er that nuclear security is an important security issue that needs attention in So utheast Asia. The device was lost while being transported from Seremban in Negri Semb ilan to Shah Alam, Selangor by two technicians of a company that provides testing, calibration and inspection services to heavy industries. There are concerns that the unknown amount of radio active iridium contained in the device could cause radiation exposure or be used as a weapon, otherwise known as \u201cdirty bomb\u201d. Potential Risks Although there is no nuclear power plant in the reg ion currently, radioactive sources are widely used for civilian applications in medica l, industrial, agricultural, and scientific research fields. Without stringent overs ight on the use and handling of radioactive materials, there are potential risks of these being accidentally leaked, stolen and used for malicious purposes, or released indiscriminately by non-state actors/terrorists through \u2018dirty bombs\u2019. Hence, a key point to note is that the security of radiological material is an important component of nuclear security. According to the lat est Global Incidents and Trafficking Database prepared by the James Martin Centre for Nonprolife ration Studies (CNS), there were 870 reported incidents involving radioac tive materials (theft, missing, leaked, smuggled etc) from 51 countries between 201 3 and 2017. Four of such incidents were reported in Southeast A sia, including one case in Malaysia last year. The need to strengthen radiological secu rity cannot therefore be overstated. Southeast Asia\u2019s Nuclear Security Challenges This recent incident highlights the importance of n uclear security to ASEAN. While nuclear security is often understood to be about se curing nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons, it is also very much about the sec urity of radioactive materials. As defined by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA), nuclear security is \u201cthe prevention and detection of, and response to, theft , sabotage, unauthorized access, illegal transfer or other malicious acts involving nuclear material, other radioactive substances or their associated facilities\u201d. Even in the nuclear weapon-free Southeast Asia, the re is a broad range of legitimate uses of radioactive material especially in industri al facilities, hospitals, research reactors, and scientific laboratories. For instance , radioactive sources are present in 17 hospitals in Thailand and seven hospitals in the Philippines. Radioactive material is under the State\u2019s regulator y, export and licensing control, but unauthorised removal or loss puts the material out of regulatory control. This is where the potential risk of this being used by an adversa ry in a malicious act is present. This risk has clear transborder implications. The risk in the region is further magnified with th e presence of extremist groups wanting to use \u2018dirty bombs\u2019, weak maritime securit y, insufficient border and export controls, and scarcity of adequately trained radiol ogical security responders. The chance that a malicious actor or group could try to get access to radioactive material cannot be ignored. But apart from the immediate impact of a radiologic al leak, attack or explosion, there are four major transboundary consequences associate d with a nuclear security incident \u0336 health, economic, societal and environmental. Thes e consequences are all non-traditional security concerns which should comp el all ASEAN member states to enhance cooperation on nuclear security. Enhancing Regional Nuclear Security Cooperation Establishing an effective and sustainable nuclear s ecurity infrastructure is crucial for the protection of states, people, society and the e nvironment. In ASEAN, there are in place building blocks of a nuclear security infrast ructure that needs to be strengthened, beginning with every state that utilises nuclear te chnology and radioactive material. National governments are responsible for legal and regulatory framework that governs how security at relevant facilities are maintained and how radioactive material is managed, utilised and transported. While not all AS EAN member states have ratified legally binding nuclear security conventions and vo luntarily developed national regulations based on IAEA\u2019s code of conduct and gui dance on the security of radioactive material, regional cooperation framewor ks can help member states strengthen nuclear security. The ASEAN Network of Regulatory Bodies on Atomic En ergy (ASEANTOM) focuses on sharing of best practices, exchange of experienc es, assisting ASEAN member states in enhancing their regulatory frameworks, an d capacity building through training courses and technical collaboration with other inte rnational organisations such as the IAEA and European Commission. ASEANTOM\u2019s latest nuclear security-related activiti es include the Nuclear Security Border Exercise along Malaysia-Thailand borders; AS EANTOM Workshop on Capacity Building and Strengthening the Nuclear and Radiation Safety and Security Network in the ASEAN Region; the IAEA Regional Work shop on Strategy to Establish Inventory for the Security of Radioactive Sources; and the IAEA Regional Training Course on Nuclear Security Culture. Another key regional collaboration on nuclear secur ity is the Regional Radiological Security Partnership in Southeast Asia (RRSP), whic h brought together Southeast Asian states, Australia, the United States and the IAEA. Launched by Australia in 2004, RRSP primarily aims to improve the physical protection and security management of high-risk radioactive so urces in Southeast Asia through technical assistance and training, providing radiat ion detection equipment, sharing of best practices, and on-going cooperative activities on searching of missing radioactive sources and emergency response amongst national aut horities, regulators and law enforcers. Addressing Weak Nuclear Security Culture Despite the robust regional cooperation on nuclear security, one evident shortcoming of nuclear security governance in Southeast Asia is weak nuclear security culture, highlighting the importance of human factors, such as attitudes, awareness and behaviours. Nuclear power and utilisation of radioa ctive material for non-power applications do not merely involve technological as pects. Human errors such as complacency and the lack of cr itical thinking play a role in most reported incidents, including cases of loss and the ft. It is therefore crucial to develop and strengthen the security culture of individuals, organisations and institutions that handle radioactive material. In Malaysia alone, the re are around 21,000 radiation workers. It is important that all of them demonstrate a stro ng security culture. However, only a few ASEAN member states such as Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia have established nuclear security support centres of exc ellence that can provide holistic education and training for radiation workers, resea rchers, hospital staff and industrial workers. National policy frameworks on developing a nuclear security culture remain fragmented or non-existent in several regional coun tries. To make the ASEAN\u2019s capacity-building cooperation m ore comprehensive, it is equally important to complement regional technical training workshops on nuclear energy with enhanced training assistance on strengt hening the security culture \u0336 the human factors. With the ever-present transboundary risks of radiological emergencies and stolen radioactive material, improving the rate at which security policies are fully implemented and understood by all stakeholders coul d dramatically narrow the gaps in nuclear security in the region.

    "context": "COMMENTARY ON 21 MAY 2021, South Korean President Moon Jae -in visited President Joe Biden at the White House, following Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga\u2019s 16 April visit by about five weeks. The unmistakable East Asian accent of the first face-to-face bilateral summits with the recently installed US president clearly ushered in a new era of Sinocentric US foreign policy. That\u2019s where the parallel between the Suga and Moon visits ends, however. The Suga summit was a limited success based on core agreement on essential strategic interests. The Moon visit was \u201cspun\u201d into a manufactured success that skirted persistent if evolving frictions in the bilateral relationship. Moon\u2019s 'Success' President Moon contributed to \u201csuccess\u201d by trimming his ideological sails in hopes of getting a political boost for his unpopular party in the presidential election scheduled for May 2022. He pledged US$40 billion in high -tech US investment and agreed th at South Korean and US forces in South Korea should be better integrated into the broader US regional strategy whose focus is deterrence of China. He thus signed on to the US view of deterrence first, diplomacy second, so acknowledged that no Biden -Kim sum mits are likely before the South Korean election. Moon got what he came for: 550,000 COVID vaccine doses for the South Korean military. Washington also dropped agreed limits in range and payload on South Korean missiles in effect since 1979. Relatedly, t he two sides affirmed their intention to progress towards the transfer of operational military command (OPCOM, in alliance lingo) of the 27,500 US troops in South Korea from US to South Korean (ROK) auspices. The US contribution to \u201csuccess\u201d resided in th e fact that US officials consider Moon a lame duck president better waited out than accommodated. His approval rating hovers at around 30 percent and polls show key Democratic Party (DP) policy views to be broadly unpopular. The likely election of a riva l Peoples Power Party (PPP) government in May 2022, US officials think, will bring ROK policy into line with that of Japan and the US. Differences That Matter Several differences between the current state of the US -Japan and US -South Korea alliances thro w light on the two summits\u2019 outcomes, and illustrate the oddities of the US-ROK relationship. Since the neo -totalitarian aspirations of the Xi Jinping regime became clear, Japanese officials have favoured more muscular US deterrence postures. Trump seeme d an improvement over the second Obama administration, but Biden\u2019s election raised concern over a regression. The Biden administration\u2019s \u201cextreme competition\u201d posture seemed to have let to some relief in Tokyo. South Korea under Moon has taken the opposit e position. Instead of pushing Washington, Seoul has strived to avoid being pushed by it. This leaves it free to essentially appease China in hopes that Beijing would pressure North Korea to accommodate Moon\u2019s denuclearisation and unification line. Moon\u2019 s extended \u201cSunshine\u201d policy view, originally promulgated in 1998 by President Kim Dae -jung, could hardly differ more from Japan\u2019s stoic realism. The North Korea Factor Japanese leaders know that North Korea will shed its nuclear weapons under only two conditions: a crisis of unknown provenance that destroys the current regime; and the increasingly remote possibility that the Kim dynasty would trade its ultima ratio for a US security guarantee against China. President Moon, on the other hand, is ideologically committed to the proposition that the North wants to denuclearise, formally end the Korean War and normalise its relations with the US. His intra -Korean reconcili ation diplomacy, punctuated by Moon\u2019s repeated urging that US leaders reduce sanctions against North Korea and conduct new US -DPRK summits he can influence \u2500 like the Trump -Kim Summits in Singapore and Hanoi \u2500 is designed to lubricate his vision of denucle arised reunification and earn him the historic -scale political credit he dreams of. So while Japan desires maximally robust US deterrence capabilities nearby, DP leaders hold US military deployments in and around Korea responsible for harming efforts to conciliate with North Korea. Moon has said calming things about the US, but he would dissolve or radically reorient the US -ROK alliance if he could. Since he cannot, he seeks South Korean control over its own military options mainly to ensure that ROK fo rces are never actually called on to fight. Competing Errors Moon\u2019s view is somewhere between an error and a fantasy, as are his related assumptions that China favours a unified Korea and would countenance the end of the North Korean nuclear programme. But most US analysts believe that the continued presence of US ground troops in South Korea still serves a benign tripwire function despite the end of the Cold War, the rusting of North Korea\u2019s conventional military capabilities, and its presumed ability to strike the continental US with nuclear weapons. That belief, the reification of a decades -old mental habit, also now qualifies as something between error and fantasy. US ground troops in South Korea stoke anti -Americanism, contribute to the polarisati on of ROK politics and thus enable DP ideologues to occupy the Blue House. They also make plump targets for North Korean artillery in the event of a major military crisis, so actually hamstring US options in such a crisis. Their presence nevertheless gua rantees major US involvement in another war in Korea regardless of whether it serves any vital US national security interest. In sum, they constitute a strategic liability for the US. So the 21 May Biden -Moon Summit was that oddest of birds in statecraft: two sides hewing either obsessively or habitually to conflicting points of view that nevertheless spite their own interests. Needed: A More Flexible US Regional Security Posture The Biden administration should have welcomed Moon\u2019s desire to reconfigure the US - ROK alliance and, indeed, ending the missile limitations and movement toward an OPCOM shift both point that way. Yet the logical conclusion \u2500 remove US ground troops in but maintain the US nuclear umbrella over South Korea \u2500 never occurred. It should also have respected South Korea\u2019s desire not to be made publicly to choose between the US and China. Enhancing South Korea\u2019s military clout and independence serves US aims without need for hanging an anti -China placard around Seoul\u2019s neck. Moreover, Washington\u2019s pointing South Korea at China increases Beijing\u2019s incentive to answer by enabling North Korean nuclear -weapons brinksmanship as a decoupling agent against US alliance relationships throughout the region. US deterrence posture in the Indo -Pacific would benefit from segregating the insoluble mess of Korea from the rest of the region, and building up its regional politico -military footprint elsewhere. Maintaining the US -ROK alliance status quo with mere incremental adjustments harms the prospect . Japanese officials grasp this logic but chafe at the unstable transition it implies. The Biden administration should therefore partner with Tokyo toward a more flexible and robust regional security posture. Had this been thought through five months ago, that effort could have begun on 16 April when Prime Minister Suga was in Washington. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY BUSINESS IS always brisk in the tea -leaf reading industry at the start of a new US administration. As the Biden administration approaches its first hundred days in office on 30 April 2021, th e ASEAN world is abuzz with analysis and prediction, and the usual ensemble of premonition and hope. Among the questions posed as torque points for inquiry is this: What to make of the 3 March White House -issued Interim National Security Strategy Guidance (INSSG)? What does it mean for Singapore and Southeast Asia? The INSSG The INSSG is the most significant and lavishly verbal of the Biden administration\u2019s early signals. It\u2019s also unique in being the first time since Congress mandated the Strategic Gui dance obligation on the Executive Branch in the hallmark 1986 Goldwater -Nichols legislation that a new administration promulgated an interim assessment, and so quickly. Why did the Biden White House do it? Three reasons converge to explain it. First, whil e it remains to be seen if the new administration has actually worked out substantive policy choices, it does show every sign of having a communications strategy whose principal audience is domestic more than foreign. This is not incidental, for it sees do mestic political equities as being at the very core of US foreign and national security policy. Why? Administration principals believe that if the Republican Party in its current state of manic xenophobia, and with its anti -democratic, conspiracy -addled s iege mentality, should reclaim control of the Congress in 2022 and the White House in 2024, the very basis of US foreign policy would likely disintegrate. This entails its liberal positive -sum principles, its alliances and institutions, and the substrate o f domestic political support for an active, constructive US global role. They are not mistaken, which helps explain the INSSG\u2019s simplistic Manichean democracy -versus -authoritarianism organising template, one that reminds us more of the Truman Doctrine th an anything else. This choice speaks to a domestic audience, the bet here being that cold -hearted Trumpian transactionalism in international affairs appeals not to the American soul. Non-Traditional Dimensions of National Security Policy Second and accor dingly, the INSSG deviates from the by -now standard Democratic narrative about \u201cnon -traditional\u201d dimensions of national security policy in three key ways, all attuned to domestic politics. It doubles down on the national security impact of \u201cclimate chang e\u201d, which amounts to a secular religious calling whatever its actual scientific basis; it expresses a preference for selected protectionism to align trade policy with the needs of the American middle class; and, relatedly, it sharply prioritises both the d omestic bases and impact of foreign and national security policies over traditional perspectives. In sum, the United States used to have \u201cforeign and national security policies\u201d seen as more separate than not from its domestic policies and politics; now it has for all practical purposes domestic policies (and politics) with foreign/national security aspects. Third, the White House appears to have wanted to quickly dispel concern that it lacked bandwidth for foreign policy given such a full and portentou s domestic agenda, and that it could not see beyond the contours of restoring what foreign policies existed on 19 January 2017, the last full day of the Obama administration. The truth is that these constraints are real. A President \u201cAll In\u201d That said, i t was wise to try to manage impressions with the INSSG, and it was done with shrewdness aforethought. Whatever material NSC Advisor Jake Sullivan pulled off the shelf for quick editing, President Biden himself is understood to have put his own hand on the document. That matters; it means that, whatever the policies may be, the president is \u201call in\u201d with them, and not randomly at odds with his own advisers as Trump was for four years of mayhem and ceaseless uncertainly. It is a statement about the relation ship between sound process and coherent outcomes, and it is a statement well worth having made. Having a communications strategy is important, and a proffered US$715 billion defence budget is a signal at least as powerful, if cruder, as the INSSG. But in the end substance matters more than symbols. Here the picture so far is mixed. Despite much talk about democracy and human rights, the actual complexity of applying aspirational idealism has come clear in early dealings with Saudi Arabia. The early speec hes and the INSSG have not made it any easier to deal with Afghanistan, or to restore some version of the JCPOA with Iran, or to parry increasingly bold Chinese tests over Taiwan and Russian tests in Ukraine, or to work out effective and practical policies over Myanmar or North Korea. They have not made it any easier to decide how to parry Iranian proxy threats whose territorial ground -zero includes both Iraq and Syria. And that\u2019s the short list of pressing issues the president does not have enough time for . Southeast Asia? The 23 pages of the INSSG mention Singapore and Southeast Asia once, after Europe, the Western Hemisphere, Israel and the Middle East, Australia, India and New Zealand, and just before the Pacific Island nations: \u201cWe will deepen our par tnership with India and work alongside New Zealand, as well as Singapore, Vietnam, and other Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states, to advance shared objectives.\u201d Could have been worse: Africa is not mentioned at all. But not much worse if you are trying to read real priorities into a text like the INSSG. You should not be doing that, however. Many readers in foreign governments and media establishments tend to treat documents like the INSSG as scriptural, as containing gnostic wi sdom to be found by careful exegesis of subtle hints. The INSSG expresses important nuances even though its actual signals do not reside within the four corners of the document but outside them. But a new administration still staffing up and yet to deal with a major foreign crisis does not even know what it thinks about most things to a level of specificity that actually matters. Biden & the Indo -Pacific In general, while the Indo -Pacific will concern the Biden administration a great deal, if only beca use of the presumed centrality of China as singular challenger to US preeminence, it will depend on the Quad quasi -alliance and, within the Quad more on its relationship with Japan, to help manage the challenge. That was the signal from the first -ever, i f virtual, Quad summit on 12 March. Southeast Asian countries are liable to be seen mainly as stakes in the competition and puzzle pieces to be assembled tactically to add to the larger picture, not as co -equal diplomatic partners. It is useful to think of a new US administration in foreign policy as a brain full of dendrites waiting to be shaped into neural pathways by contact with reality. The brain, connected obviously to the body politic, owes much to inheritance, and reality does not typically jump o ut of its own skin. But there is still plenty of variation to make predictions about how that brain will work risky exercises in tea -leaf reading. Best to enjoy the tea, and leverage its stimulating qualities for purposes of careful observation. ",

    "context": "Commentary VERTICAL FARMING is one among the technologies tran sforming agriculture today. Vegetables are grown on multiple layers, and its in novative version, the indoor vertical farm, run with computer-optimised LED lighting, gro wing environments and water/nutrient supply. These are making urban farmi ng more profitable, such that governments are realising its potential to create j obs and value-add to the economy, apart from enhancing urban food security. Staking the future of urban farming on these techno logies, Singapore tendered 12 plots of land exclusively for high-productivity lea fy vegetables (two hectares each), as 20-year leases in 2017. Singapore will likewise be repositioning itself, reinventing the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority (AVA) into the Sin gapore Food Agency (SFA). It will have a mandate to collaborate with economic agencie s in fostering a vibrant urban farming industry that can be relied on to not only enhance the robustness of city-state\u2019s food system, but also contribute to economic growth . Undersupply or overinvestment? AVA\u2019s tender results , announced in 2018, showed that out of 12 plots of land, only 10 plots were actually leased out. Out of over 28 bidd ers, only eight Singapore-based companies which have historical high-yield performa nce won these tenders, with one company even acquiring three plots. From a traditional food production perspective, one may think that less plots tendered out means less locally produced food. However, tech nology has so changed farming, that less land no longer means less production. Iro nically, our RSIS NTS Centre Report found that the risk is that more land may have bee n leased out than can be viably used for indoor farm purposes. It showed that less than half of the plots taken up (between one and four plots) could be viable investments within a 20-year investment p eriod, assuming that these new farms utilise similar indoor farming systems as sim ulated in the Report (14 layers or tiers of plants, grown on two- to three- storey bui ldings), and that they compete for the highest priced imported vegetables. Risks to Businesses No opportunity comes without risks. A key risk in t he scenario spelled out above is \u2018competitive risk\u2019, or the risk that companies self -defeatingly compete for the same product. To value-add to the economy while enhancing food se curity robustness, new farms will expectedly seek to replace imported vegetables with local production, a strategy known as \u2018 import-substitution \u2019. This strategy has its limits, however, because d emand for leafy vegetables in Singapore is finite. For in stance, lettuce and chicory imports last year were approximately 17,000 tonnes, making up only less than a fifth of total leafy vegetable consumption. Thus, if companies aim to replace imports of this s ame vegetable with local production, an over-supply can occur; this applies especially i n the case of the highest priced vegetables. This translates to the risk of having lower revenue s than expected. This then translates to \u2018liquidity risk\u2019, when lowe r-than-expected revenues prevent companies from making timely payments for their loa ns and other financing costs. This risk is punctuated in the case of indoor farms beca use of their capital-intensive nature, requiring significant amount of financing to set th em up. Risk Exposure of Government Optimistically, the companies who won the tender ma y have already considered these risks before they made their investments. However, these risks could potentially spill over to the government, because government has co-i nvested in some of the technologies relevant to these farms. For instance, since 2014 , AVA\u2019s S$63 million Agricultural Productivity Funds (APF) have allowed businesses to benefit from as much as 70 per cent co-investment by government in new technologies for boosting farm pr oductivity. It is likely that indoor farms qualify for these fu nds, as the APF cut-off is a four-time increase in productivity, whereas indoor vertical f arms can potentially have more than five times productivity, as they can grow on five o r more layers, apart from further gains from better optimised growing environments. Way Forward: Policy Options To reduce investor uncertainty, a critical priority is to use the information given by the new lease-holding companies when they were bidding for land, to assess the potential production capacity (for specific crops), profitabi lity and commercial viability of these farms. This information can then be analysed, along side trade statistics on historical leafy vegetable import and/or consumption growth tr ends, to gauge the likelihood of an over-supply. Established academia and industry players will also play an important role in supporting this new industry. For instance, in prep aring the aforementioned RSIS NTS Centre Report , the authors of this piece developed a supply-side tool, the UrbanAgInvest , for preliminary commercial assessment of indoor f arms, under the ambit of the RSIS NTS Centre, Nanyang Technological University (NTU, Singapore). This was further tailored for investors through an exploratory collaboration effort with the Enterprise Development Group at Temasek Interna tional. There are also actions that can be explored to redu ce risk. One is to alter the permitted uses in the tendered property, beyond leafy vegetab le production purposes, allowing other items to be produced. It can also re-focus th e APF by co-investing with companies in technologies that support lower priced crops more cost-effectively, to reduce the number of producers competing for the mo st expensive crops. Government may also co-invest in technologies that increase the quality, cleanliness and appeal of these crops, to better address local supermarkets\u2019, restaurants\u2019 and retailers\u2019 needs. Beyond local needs, the APF may a lso be used to develop tailored crops that meet the needs in overseas markets. Foresighted actions above, shared in an earlier NTS Insight publication , can be explored in addressing risks and uncertainties in t he 2017 tender. This could establish Singapore\u2019s position as a centre for urban food production in the region, as Minister Lawrence Wong boldly called in 2017, leading the wa y for other fast-urbanising countries in Southeast Asia.

    "context": "COMMENTARY SINCE LATE March 2021, media reports and some observers have postulated about the possibility of an open conflict between Russia and Ukraine. This follows the death s of four Ukrainian soldiers in a battle against Russian -backed separatists in the Donetsk Region of eastern Ukraine; deployment of Russian forces on the border; and statements by Western and Russian officials in reaction. President Joseph Biden expressed \u201cunwavering support for Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russia\u2019s ongoing aggression in the Donbas and Crimea\u201d to his Ukrainian counterpart, President Volodymyr Zelensky on 2 April. EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson conveyed their concerns, similarly pledging their support for Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity. A NATO spokesman conveyed the alliance\u2019s support in the same vein whi le a Franco -German statement emphasised the same point. NATO Membership for Ukraine? NATO Secretary -General Jens Stoltenberg repeated NATO\u2019s stance during a call with President Zelensky on 6 April. On his part, the Ukrainian leader, in a tweet after the call, stressed that Ukrainian membership of \u201cNATO is the only way to end the war in Donbas. Ukraine's MAP will be a real signal for Russia\u201d. His government has expressed the hope that Ukraine would be invited this year to join NATO\u2019s Membership Action P lan (MAP), which is essentially a step designed for aspirants to NATO membership. On Russia\u2019s part, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stressed that Russia was \"moving troops within its own territory at its own discretion, and this shouldn't concern anyone\u201d . Reacting to Zelensky\u2019s call for NATO MAP to be implemented, Peskov told reporters that NATO membership for Ukraine would not help it to resolve the separatist issue but \u201cwill only worsen the situation\". Russia has been consistently arguing against NATO membership for Ukraine. The Deputy Head of the presidential administration, Dmitri Kozak, said on 9 April that Moscow would defend the separatist regions. \"Everything depends on the scale of the conflagration,\" adding that an escalation could mark the \"b eginning of the end\" for Ukraine. President Zelensky was at the frontline on 9 April as well, in what is seen as a morale - boosting visit. Nevertheless, a military clash between Russia and Ukraine is not imminent for the following reasons: Russo -EU relat ions Nord Stream 2 This gas pipeline project to Germany is crucial to Russia\u2019s gas sector as well as Russia\u2019s politico -strategic objectives in Europe. Opposed by the US and some EU countries, it is almost completed and despite long -standing US pressure, is still supported by Germany\u2019s leaders. A Russian -Ukrainian war, irrespective of who makes the first move, would place the viability of the Nord Stream 2 project in dire straits, even after its completion. Should hostilities break out before its comple tion, that would drive the final nail into the coffin of the project. Russian vaccine The pandemic has brought both Russia and the EU to the realisation that cooperation is required to manage and eliminate it. To this end, the European Medicines Agency started a review of the Russian vaccine, Sputnik V, in March. Reportedly, supplies have already arrived in Hungary and Slovakia, with Austria currently engaged in talks for it as well. Germany\u2019s health minister has also said Germany would be discussing w ith Russia the supply of the vaccine while the German state of Bavaria has reportedly placed advanced orders for it. There have also been reports that joint production in EU countries could begin, after the vaccine\u2019s registration. Russia\u2019s vaccine acts no t only as a source of revenue, but also as an extension of its \u201csoft power\u201d and might help ease tensions with the EU; however, a war with Ukraine would lead to more strained relations with the EU and jeopardise its vaccine diplomacy. Russo -US relations Despite the Russian outcry over President Biden\u2019s \u201ckiller\u201d remark about his Russian counterpart and the consequent recall of Russian Ambassador Anatoly Antonov to Moscow for consultations, Russo -US relations, while tense, have not totally broken down. Climate conference This fact is testified by President Vladimir Putin\u2019s reported acceptance of Biden\u2019s invitation to attend a live streamed Leaders\u2019 Summit on Climate that he will host on 22-23 April. President Xi Jinping and Putin are among 40 world leaders invited to this meeting. Space cooperation Russia extended a space cooperation agreement with the US on 3 April. The original cooperation agreement, signed in 1992 and extended four times previously, provided the basis for projects between NASA and Ros kosmos. Biden -Putin phone chat President Biden spoke with President Putin on 13 April and \u201cproposed a summit meeting in a third country in the coming months to discuss the full range of issues facing the US and Russia\u201d. The US\u2019 latest sanctions on Russ ia covering the financial, economic and diplomatic sectors have cast a cloud on a possible summit but might act to deter Russian military action against Ukraine. US/EU Support for Ukraine In the face of the pandemic and their concomitant socio -economic and political challenges, the US or the EU cannot support to the hilt, any unprovoked Ukrainian military thrust into the separatist regions. Moreover, as long it is not a NATO member, Ukraine cannot reckon with full Western military assistance for any offe nsive military action against its separatist regions. Ukraine itself has stated that it does not plan any offensive action, according to a statement released on 9 April by Ruslan Khomchak, chief of the general staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Geopo litical Considerations The Russian military build -up is meant to show the flag to the Ukrainians as well as the West that Russian support for separatist regions remains strong. However, Russian actions might lead to a situation it does not desire namely the introduction of Western military forces into Ukraine. NATO/US troops could be invited or be deployed into Ukraine during or after an open Russo -Ukrainian conflict \u2013 a prospect Russia would not relish. Hence, Russia is unlikely to provide the West with any reason to take such a step. An open Russo -Ukrainian military conflict would mean the political danse macabre for Russo -Western relations. Unlike Georgia, Ukraine lies in a very strategic corner of Europe and such a conflict would bring home to the Eu ropeans the immediate challenge that Russian military power poses to their security. A full break with the West might also lead to Russia having no other choice but to finally and fully throw in its lot with China. Such a move would go against the prevai ling grain of Russian strategic thought as it would mean a significant loss of Russian strategic manoeuvre and independence vis -\u00e0-vis China and the US. Hence, President Putin will not make such an injudicious move against Ukraine. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY THE G EOSTRATEGIST from India, Brahma Chellaney, is frequently credited with having coined the term \u201c Debt Trap Diplom acy (DTD)\u201d in 2017. Chellaney opined that the aim of China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) was to saddle small nations with debt that they could not hope to repay \u201cleaving them even more firmly under China\u2019s thumb\u201d. Since then, based on a review of a li mited number of cases and projects, many other commentators and analysts have come up with similar views on the BRI. The DTD thesis has, therefore, morphed into something approaching conventional wisdom. World Leaders\u2019 Use of DTD Thesis The DTD thesis h as also been widely used by world leaders. For example, in 2018, United States Vice President, Mike Pence , referred t o the imperative to provide \"foreign nations a just and transparent alternative to China\u2019s debt -trap diplomacy\". A bipartisan group of 16 US senators in August 2018 also expressed apprehensions about the BRI by citing \u201cthe dangers of China\u2019s debt -trap diplomacy\u201d. They noted that it was imperative that the US counters China\u2019s attempts to hold other countries fin ancially hostage and force ransoms that further its geopolitical goals. Leaders in Japan and Australia which together with the United States and India comprise the Quad (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue forum), also frequently use the term. A recent research paper authored by Lee Jones and Shahar Hameiri from Chatham House, a London -based international affairs think tank, offers a robust challenge to the DTD thesis. Jone s and Hameiri argue that the BRI portrays a reality that is both messier and more nuanced. They find that oftentimes controversial BRI projects were initiated by recipient governments, and the perceived debt problems arose mainly because of the misconduct of the local elites. However, their focus is on the experience of only two countries, Sri Lanka and Malaysia, a very small subset of over 165 countries and international organisations that have signed the BRI memorandum of understanding (MOU) or other co operation agreements with China. DTD a Myth? In our recent book , China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative: Impacts on Asia and Policy Agenda , we conducted an online perception survey of opi nion leaders (defined as policymakers, academics, and representatives of businesses and media) from a wide range of stakeholder countries, 26 Asian countries that have signed the BRI MOU with China. Stakeholder participation and perception are important fo r the success of a BRI project. Also, it is the stakeholder country that is ultimately responsible for repaying BRI loans to China. Opinion leaders from Japan, Australia, and India were excluded from our survey as they have not yet signed the BRI MOU. Chi na was also excluded for obvious reasons. Over 1200 opinion leaders responded to our survey questionnaire. We also simulated a computable general equilibrium model, and conducted regional case studies to assess other economic impacts of the BRI. The key f indings of our book challenge the DTD thesis on three grounds: \u2022 First, after having considered both the benefits and costs of the BRI, on balance, 41.6% of the respondents to our survey of stakeholders believed that the BRI represented a net benefit for their countries, while only 14.8% said that it was a net cost. 40.6% noted that it was too early to tell. The strongest endorsements for the BRI came from Bangladesh (64.5%), Pakistan (59.7%), and Nepal (58.8%), while the opinion leaders from the Philippin es were the least receptive to the BRI. The Korean, Myanmar, and Vietnamese opinion leaders took a more neutral stance saying that it was too early to ascertain whether the BRI was a net opportunity or cost to their respective countries. \u2022 Second , on the DTD thesis itself, more than 42% of the respondents to our stakeholder survey rejected the narrative as \u201calarmist\u201d, although it is important to bear in mind that 30.6% felt otherwise. More than a quarter (27.3%) of the respondents had not made up their minds as yet. Echoing the conclusions of the Chatham House report, some respondents noted that domestic factors which were in the purview of host governments (such as corruption and reckless propensity to borrow) were responsible for rising debt leve ls rather than Chinese BRI financing. For instance, one opinion leader remarked that \u201cDTD happens when weak governance is married with international borrowing\u201d. Like the Chatham House report, yet others felt that China\u2019s financial system was too frag mented and poorly coordinated for it to pursue detailed strategic objectives such as ensnaring countries in debt traps. \u2022 Third , using the methodology developed by the Center for Global Development in Washington DC, which focuses on the level of public and publicly -guaranteed debt to GDP ratio, we found that three out of the five South Asian countries for which data are available are presently facing debt distress. These are Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Maldives. However, Sri Lanka owes more to Japan than to China (only 3%). The country also borrows extensively from international capital markets (54%). Similarly, Pakistan owes more to multilateral development banks and Islamic creditors (34%) than to China (only 6%). Maldives appears to be an exception, but the country has been at a high risk of distress for at least a decade, with or without the BRI. COVID -19 and BRI\u2019s Fu ture Summing up, in contrast to the views of many commentators and analysts, our recent book finds that although there are a large number of implementation issues confronting the BRI, the DTD thesis is more a myth rather than a reality. Presently, becaus e of the ongoing pandemic, many BRI projects are on hold and a number of BRI countries are facing difficulties in servicing their debt obligations to China. China is helping these countries to restructure their debt including through partial debt forgivene ss. China will not let the BRI collapse as this project, labelled as the \u201cproject of the century\u201d by President Xi Jinping, marks the country\u2019s re -emergence in the global scene and its eventual ascent to be the number one economy in the world. The success of the BRI could also spell good news for Asia as a whole. The BRI has the potential to convert \u201cMaritime Asia\u201d into \u201cContinental Asia\u201d which will herald the \u201cRenaissance of Asia\u201d as the global centre of economic and political gravity.

    "context": "COMMENTARY CHINA MADE waves recently i n financial circles when it trialled its Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) \u2013 a digital renminbi \u2013 across four cities in April 2020. The trial was expanded when the People\u2019s Bank of China announced that the city of Shenzhen will distribute RMB10 mi llion (around S$2 million), for free, in a lottery system to residents, which they can spend the e -renminbi in selected merchants and in their city\u2019s metro system. The lottery was oversubscribed with two million registrants vying for 50,000 digital \u2018red pa ckets\u2019, each worth 200 Chinese yuan. The Chinese experience catalysed a wave of discussions by central banks around the world \u2013 how best to harness and implement a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), and what good will it bring to the state? It is worth bearing in mind that CBDCs are not the sole remit of nation states as regional groupings are showing keen interest as well. Regional Interests & ASEAN Digital Currency? The European Union, for example, has accelerated its efforts into studying how a digital euro could be initiated and public consultations have taken place since 12 October this year. While the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) recently introduced a single currency (the eco), crypto -enthusiasts pointed out how this was a missed opportunity to digitalise the currency on blockchain technology. It is timely, then, for ASEAN to kickstart discussions on the possibility of a CDBC and how such an \u2018ASEAN Coin\u2019 might look like. The most obvious benefit of an ASEAN digital currency is that it would dramatically lower cross -border transactions and payments. Where a company would previously exchange currency to pay for cross -border goods or services, an ASEAN digital currency promises to cut out middleman costs for currency exchanges and make payments instantaneously. Plugged in with the latest developments in the sphere of \u2018decentralised finance\u2019 and \u2018smart contracts\u2019, it has the potential to be radically transformative. This would also be synergistic with existing ASEAN projects su ch as the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), ASEAN Investment Area (AIA) and the ASEAN Connectivity 2025 roadmap. An ASEAN Coin can certainly be catalytic to the emphasis on establishing ASEAN as a \u201csingle market and production base\u201d and having a \u201cfree and open investment regime\u201d. Second, a 2019 Bain report suggests that seven out of 10 Southeast Asians are underbanked or unbanked, having \u201cno access to c redit cards or have no long -term savings product\u201d or \u201cwithout access to a basic bank account\u201d. An ASEAN digital currency can bring financial inclusion to the millions of unbanked and underbanked ASEAN citizens and small businesses. For example, a fisherm an in Indonesia could theoretically be plugged into the ASEAN financial ecosystem with a smartphone \u2013 and do business directly with other ASEAN companies and end consumers - without holding a bank account. Promoting ASEAN Financial & Political Centrality Third, an ASEAN digital currency can help the bloc preserve its financial and political centrality. Given the maturity of the Chinese e -renminbi, it is only a matter of time before it gets rolled out nationally. When that happens, the next natural step is to blend the e -renminbi into its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and regional diplomatic efforts. It is reported that merchants in Seoul \u2019s Myeongdong District (which sees substantial Chinese tourists) are open to transacting in the e -renminbi. Given that Alipay and WeChat are already common payment options in much of Southeast Asia, it would be rather frictionless to transit into the e -Renminbi system. In any event, having an ASEAN CBDC could bolster the regional group\u2019s financial autonomy \u2013 ensuring that it does not have to rely on any major power for financial inclusion or be overly dependent on extra -mural forces for its fintech archit ecture. To be sure, ASEAN countries are already at various stages of developing their own CBDCs. Singapore and Thailand\u2019s experimentations with CBDCs are at a very mature stage and could see pilot implementations shortly. Other ASEAN countries such as the Philippines are considering introducing a CBDC. In that way, technical know -how and expert knowledge already exist at the ASEAN level to get things going. Vision of ASEAN Coin & Its Challenges Notwithstanding the potential for ASEAN countries to create an ASEAN Coin, there remain considerable challenges to realising this vision. First, digital infrastructures differ significantly. A few countries are substantially ahead of others in having robust and technically sound digital eco -systems. Singapore, fo r instance, ranks fourth worldwide in the global connectivity index and has a mobile penetration rate of around 150 per cent. This is far higher than Laos, which saw its mobile penetration rates reach only 54 per cent in 2017, while Internet penetration ra tes stood at 43 per cent in January 2020. Next, and perhaps the biggest challenge is to convince political leaders that an ASEAN digital currency do not necessarily have to entail a pooling of sovereignty nor having a single monetary system. An ASEAN wide digital currency could model itself after Facebook\u2019s Libra template \u2013 pegging it to a basket of ASEAN currencies \u2013 thus ensuring price stability and without the need for countries to give up their national currencies. The central banks of member states must then ensure that this ASEAN coin is liquid and easily exchangeable to respective national currencies. In any event, previous infrastructural, financial, and economic disparities have not prevented ASEAN from setting ambitious goals such as the realisa tion of an ASEAN Economic Community. Unintended Consequences As with any novel ideas, the prospects of unintended consequences remain. An ASEAN Coin, could, foreseeably throw the national monetary policies of ASEAN countries out of whack. Even so, adopti on could take a staggered approach where it is trialled with selected ASEAN industries before being rolled out to other sectors. Implementation could also be fraught and questions over money laundering with such a regional currency must also be confronte d. Nevertheless, the pandemic has shown in very stark terms how cookie -cutter solutions that have worked for so long, needs serious re -thinking. While it may be some way off before an ASEAN -wide digital currency becomes a reality, it is imperative that AS EAN member states start thinking about this possibility in a post -physical currency world. As various political actors around the globe advance their CBDC projects, the defining inequity of the near future may not be financial inequality but technological inequality. As such, conversations about an ASEAN currency, centered on financial inclusion with ASEAN know -how, should start now. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY THE FREQUENCY of terrorist attacks may have decreas ed in the region, but the periodic occurrence of new attacks such as the Jolo Cathedral bombings in the Philippines, the Christchurch mosque shootings in N ew Zealand, and the persistent spread of radical online propaganda, serve as a gri m reminder: the threat from terrorism has not disappeared. The recent arrests o f two Singaporeans in January 2019 under the Internal Security Act (ISA) further attest to the threat of terrorism to Singapore. The detection and disruption of these threats by lo cal security agencies can be attributed to the prevailing security approach as w ell as assistance from the community at large. Recognising that active community involve ment is vital in responding to the terrorist threat, a spate of initiatives has also b een rolled out by the Singapore Government to sensitise, train, and mobilise Singap oreans to deal with terror attacks and their aftermath. However, according to the Mini stry of Home Affair\u2019s 2019 Threat Assessment Report, a survey conducted in 2018 revea led that \u201cfewer Singaporeans saw the threat [from terrorism] as imminent, even t hough more recognise[d] Singapore as a target for terrorists\u201d. Understand the \u2018Human\u2019 Dimension: Complacency This mindset is problematic as it adversely affects Singapore\u2019s \u2018Psychological Defence\u2019 by lulling the community at large into a f alse sense of security. As Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam shared, \u201c\u2026 given that we are and have been a very safe place, the first and most difficult task is getting people to understand that this is real and this is serious\u201d. If left unaddressed, this complacency can undermine Singapore\u2019s Total Defence and in particular her national crisis preparedness effo rts. The complacent mindset arises from human beings\u2019 cognitive biases that serve as m ental shortcuts to help people make sense of their surroundings, and make faster d ecisions in their lives. In the context of terrorism, for example, the absence of a ttacks in Singapore has been interpreted that Singapore will not be targeted by terrorists. This perception may lead many to dismiss the slew o f security-related messaging from the government as irrelevant. Some may even feel ov erwhelmed by existing announcements and initiatives, which not only resul t in messaging fatigue but also impair their ability to learn, actively engage in p reparedness efforts, as well as be adequately prepared. Complacency may also arise from the view that many believe the role of securing Singapore is primarily the job of the government. W hile the government has taken necessary measures and precautions to mitigate the threat of terrorism, it is important to be cognisant that there are no foolproof approac hes that can insulate any country completely from the threat today. This seeming over -reliance on the government therefore raises concerns of unrealistic expectatio ns and dependency. Overcoming Complacency through Virtual Reality The inherent complacency suggests that efforts to r aise awareness of \u2018good preparatory practices\u2019 through education might not be persuasive to individuals who see no value in doing so. Nor would scholastic argu ments alone do the job. Rather, overcoming complacency involves creating a realistic representation of the physical and psychological sensations associated wi th an attack. Currently, simulated terror attacks organised by the government at the c ommunity level, such as Exercise Northstar, seek to physically reproduce actual atta ck scenarios to help familiarise Singaporeans on what to do in the event of an attac k. The participants\u2019 experience can be further enhance d by actually immersing them in the \u2018real\u2019 conditions of an attack. At present, the y are merely playing the role of \u2018spectators\u2019 without any real or relatable means of experiencing how an attack may unfold and the resulting devastation. It is suggested that Virtual Reality (VR) technolog y can be deployed for this purpose. VR simulations basically imbue users with a sense o f presence by allowing them to experience a virtual representation, where they can receive instantaneous feedback on the sensations and emotions induced by the pheno menon. Run, Hide, Tell For example, VR simulations can be used during trai ning to expose the participants to a realistic situation that they may potentially fac e during an actual attack. In fact, studies have shown that people generally benefited more from training simulations that are realistic. VR simulations therefore serve as an opportunity fo r participants to understand the rationale behind government advisories such as \u2018run , hide, tell\u2019. More importantly, this approach has the potential to get \u2018buy-in\u2019 and enco urage cooperation from the community in the event of an attack as they would b e more aware of why and what they should do in such situations. That said, it is important to recognise that such s imulation trainings may induce trauma for the participants. There is therefore the need t o strike a balance between the realism of the attack with the potential harm that the part icipants may be exposed to. What does all this mean for the future? Put simply, it is difficult to say for certain how Singaporeans will react to an attack, particularly when we have not exactly experienced one yet. The proposed use of VR simulat ions can help overcome this issue and help Singaporeans better appreciate the r ationale of getting prepared for an attack. This can increase the resilience of the cou ntry as there will be a greater pool of people who are mentally prepared and contribute to national crisis preparedness efforts. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY CHINA\u2019S CONSENT, on 1 May 2019, to designate Pakist ani national, Masood Azhar, as a terrorist, under the relevant United Nations n orms, fulfils a long-standing Indian demand. India intensified its campaign for such UN action after Azhar\u2019s outfit owned responsibility for the internationally-condemned te rrorist attack on Indian security personnel on 14 February. China\u2019s latest decision to join the dominant view o n this issue at a UN panel is significant. Despite Pakistan being China\u2019s \u201call-we ather strategic cooperative partner\u201d since 2015, the Chinese have signalled the relative importance of neighbouring India in their expanding foreign policy calculus. This is evident from the recent Chinese attitude towards India although it has not joined C hina\u2019s worldwide Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Advocacy of Closer Sino-Indian Ties The BRI is a collective name for the multi-modal co nnectivity projects that radiate from China across continents and cover diverse spectra o f economic activities. Ahead of the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Co operation (BRF) in Beijing on 26- 27 April 2019, China knew India would not attend th e summit. It was no secret that India felt that its BRI concerns were being disrega rded by China. However, prior to the Second BRF, Chinese Ambassado r to India, Luo Zhaohui, emphasised the \u201cvision\u201d of \u201cachieving [Sino-Indian] synergy on the Belt and Road Initiative\u201d. Luo\u2019s call for creating BRI \u201csynergy\u201d ranked fourth in his priorities for improving Beijing\u2019s often-chequered relations with Delhi. Topping Luo\u2019s \u201cvision\u201d was the need for \u201cnegotiating and signing China-India T reaty of Good Neighbourliness and Friendly Cooperation\u201d. He suggested bilateral \u201cfree trade agreements\u201d and consultations to reap \u201cearly harvests\u201d even while patiently settling the Sino-In dian boundary dispute. Two factors explain Luo\u2019s advocacy. Masking Modi\u2019s Absence at BRF Firstly, Chinese President Xi Jinping chaired the S econd BRF precisely one year after he held an unprecedented \u201cinformal summit\u201d with Ind ian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Wuhan, China. For Xi, the Wuhan summit was \u201ca ne w starting point\u201d in Sino-Indian diplomacy. Modi, too, said India and China crossed a new \u201cmile stone\u201d in bilateral diplomacy during the Wuhan summit. So, new ideas like Luo\u2019s may actu ally help in masking Modi\u2019s absence at Xi\u2019s latest BRF Roundtable on 27 April 2 019. Secondly, there is a nuanced explanation for Luo\u2019s advocacy. India\u2019s opposition to the BRI initially became known when Modi, despite being invited by Xi, stayed away from the First BRF summit in Beijing in May 2017. India\u2019 s opposition was, and continues to be, driven by two strands of reason. The first reason is that a key BRI project \u2013 the Ch ina-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) \u2013 passes through a disputed area that Islama bad controls and India claims as its legitimate sovereign territory. Contrary to the BRF\u2019s norm of \u201cextensive consultation\u201d for project finalisation, India feels , its sensitivities were \u201cignored\u201d by China before it finalised the CPEC with Pakistan. A New Message from BRF The second reason for India\u2019s opposition to the BRI is somewhat subtle. India hints that the BRI projects are not \u201cbased on universally recognised international norms\u201d. Apparently in response to this criticism, the Secon d BRF affirmed as follows on 27 April 2019: \u201cAll states are equal partners for coop eration that respects openness, transparency, inclusiveness and level playing field ... We encourage ... a greater role of development finance in line with ... the agreed principles by the UNGA [United Nations General Assembly] on debt sustainability\u201d. The BRF\u2019s affirmation of faith in the UN norms of \u201c debt sustainability\u201d is noteworthy. \u201cDebts\u201d owed to Beijing and/or Chinese entities by their partners were becoming a BRI controversy in some quarters. Chinese diplomats hav e even viewed India as a key campaigner against China\u2019s alleged \u201cdebt trap diplo macy\u201d towards BRI partners. \u201cDebt sustainability\u201d is, therefore, the latest BRF messa ge that India cannot easily ignore any longer. In this milieu, Luo\u2019s proposals for updating Sino-I ndian diplomacy are essentially aspirational. Why? A \u201cfriendship treaty\u201d is a creat ive idea whose time is yet to come. A \u201cfree trade agreement\u201d is conceivable. However, C hina and India may first have to strike a harmonious chord during the ongoing negoti ations for Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). ASEAN is piloting the RCEP parleys. Not really new is the idea of seeking \u201cearly harves ts\u201d while negotiating a settlement of the Sino-Indian boundary dispute. Moreover, the dis pute is seen by both sides as a comprehensive strategic issue that cannot be easily compartmentalised. As for BRI \u201csynergy\u201d, India still sees the Chinese initiative as a bridge too far in bilateral relations. An Emerging Sino-Indian Ambience Nonetheless, some indices of India\u2019s emergence as a potential powerhouse are of interest to global China. These are India\u2019s economi c \u2018rise\u2019, nuclear arsenal, growing \u2018harmony\u2019 with America, diplomatic proximity to Rus sia, and scientific \u2018military\u2019 prowess in the Outer Space. In the Outer Space, hum anity\u2019s future frontier, India is emerging as an early pioneer behind the United Stat es, Russia and China. However, there is nothing to suggest a fanciful com ing collapse of Sino-Pakistani \u201ciron friendship\u201d or a reversal of China\u2019s latest pledge of support for Pakistan\u2019s \u201cnational dignity\u201d. The new dynamic in Sino-Indian diplomacy, therefore, is China\u2019s review of India, as is explicit in Luo\u2019s proposals. Refining China\u2019s review of India after the Second B RF, Luo disclosed, on 6 May 2019, that \u201cwe are [still] expecting India to be part of the BRI\u201d. In his view, participation in the BRI would be \u201cthe key\u201d to a \u201csolution\u201d of India\u2019s c oncerns over its huge trade deficit with China. China\u2019s messaging to the next Indian go vernment, expected to be formed later this month, cannot, therefore, be missed. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY THE UNITED States and United Kingdom have both imposed further sanctions on Russian energy imports on the argume nt that these tougher measures could effectively cripple Russia\u2019s economy and subsequently prevent Russia\u2019s further invasion into Ukraine. The European Union (EU) has been pressured, both domestically and within the region, to join in these sanctions. H owever, the EU has not reached energy independence and these second tranche of sanctions will literally choke \u2018the blood\u2019 that fuels its economy. EU\u2019s Dependence on Russian Gas In its global efforts to combat the adverse effects of climate change, Europe, in particular Germany, has primarily turned to natural gas as a \u2018cleaner\u2019 fossil fuel option in its transition towards a carbon -free economy. The EU has set off ambitious targets to reduce its carbon footprint through the use of renewables, but still reli es approximately 30% of its energy mix on natural gas, mainly used for central heating during the cold seasons. Given the scarcity of natural gas in the region, the EU imports more than 80% of the natural gas from diversified sources, of which recently, 40% of such imported natural gas comes from Russia. Russia has been supplying piped natural gas to the EU reliably at a reasonably low cost until 2021. At that point the supply fell short partly due to i) a surge in demand for energy fuels as global acti vities gain momentum from the easing of the pandemic; and ii) Russia stocked up domestically to cater for its long winter. Nevertheless, Russia has been piping natural gas to its Western counterparts in the EU even during the unstable period when it ann exed Crimea in 2014. Almost 90% of its gas exports goes to EU, which constitutes a hefty revenue for the Russian economy. Cooperation: The Best Payoff In Game Theory , the present dependence of the EU on Russian gas supply can be seen as the Nash equilibr ium in that both parties will not have any better payoffs should they pursue other strategies. Until the EU is fully able to electrify its energy grid solely with renewables, it will still need the supply of natural gas in its energy mix. A sanction on natural gas from Russia will mean diversification to other sources such as Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) from other global suppliers, which will inevitably drive global oil and gas prices even higher. Moreover, the EU will take time to build up the necessa ry infrastructure to accept LNG in order to make up the shortfall in natural gas provided by Russia. Such investments no doubt will take a toll on EU\u2019s economy and the well -being of its citizens; but the further question is whether the EU will stay true to its course of achieving its climate change targets after much immediate investments poured into its diversification strategies on natural gas? On the other hand, Russia has every reason to keep supplying gas to the EU to sustain its economy. Its industri al sector, which included oil and gas, accounted for more than 30% of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Furthermore, it will not jeopardise its reputation as a reliable supplier of oil and gas to the EU if it intends to diversify its gas export to global c lients, such as China. While the amount of gas exported to China pales in comparison (about one tenth) to the quantity supplied to the EU, Russia knows too well of the risk to its strategic ties by engaging in gas politics. Will Sanctions Stop the Ukra ine Invasion? With the possession of nuclear weapons and the theory of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) , there have not been any direct military clashes among the superpowers. Rather, military campaigns are fought through proxy wars.  Unfortunately, Ukr aine is a ground for proxy contest between NATO and Russia. The US and UK, by their calculation, are able to impose sanctions on Russian energy imports as both are less dependent compared to the EU. The reality is that the EU is being handicapped by Rus sia\u2019s gas supply, and that vulnerability has long been surfaced by experts in international relations. It\u2019s just Putin playing up the old adage of Sun Tzu\u2019s \u2018 Know yourself, know your enemy \u2019. Even if the EU joins in the sanction on Russia\u2019s energy imports, it is unlikely to stop Moscow from furthering its war on Ukraine. Russia, on the ground that its security is being threatened, will not relent until the conditions for its invasion of Ukraine are met, regardless of how harsh the sanctions will impact its economy or its people.

    "context": "COMMENTARY ON 5 APRIL 2019, the Malaysian government announced its withdrawal from the International Criminal Court (ICC). Only a month pr ior, Kuala Lumpur had acceded to the Rome Statute, the treaty which established and governs the ICC. This marked the second time the Pakatan Harapan (PH) government has abruptly walked back from a pledged commitment regarding an international agree ment. In September 2018, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad announced the government\u2019s intention to ratify all remaining core United Natio ns instruments, including the International Convention for the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), related to the protection of human rights. In November 2018, after facing significant backlash from conservative Malay-Muslim s in the opposition and civil society, the government backtracked on the announce ment. The Johor royalty led the charge of pressuring the government into withdrawin g from the Rome Statute by claiming that the treaty undermined the royal insti tutions as a whole. The Rome Statute The Rome Statute covers four major crimes \u2013 genocid e, crimes against humanity, crimes of aggression, and war crimes. Johor Crown P rince Tunku Ismail Idris (popularly known as TMJ) has claimed that ratifying the Rome Statute would allow those who are against the royalty to orchestrate wa r crimes in order to get the sultans arrested. Given that the royals have symbolic rather than exe cutive power, the TMJ\u2019s worries are out of place. What is more, the ICC is a court of last resort. Legal proceedings can only begin there after all domestic options have be en exhausted. The government has come out to refute the allegatio ns. On 27 April 2019, Attorney- General Tommy Thomas explained that under the const itutional monarchy system practised in Malaysia, the government, not the King , would be held accountable for decisions relating to war. Referring to the four cr imes, Thomas said that they were very far removed from the \u201creality\u201d of a peaceful M alaysia. Building upon this, a more plausible reason behind the concerns towards the Rome Statute could be that states which become party to the treaty are expected to subsequently pass domestic bills which are compatib le with the legal principles of the Rome Statute. The central principle of the treaty i s that no individual can be immune from prosecution. Immunity for Royalty On the issue of immunity for the royalty, Thomas re portedly said that this legal immunity was long lost since constitutional amendme nts during Mahathir\u2019s first tenure as prime minister three decades ago. However, some argue that this is somewhat debatable. The 1993 constitutional amendments may h ave curbed many of the immunities. Nevertheless, Articles 181 to 183 of th e Malaysian constitution explicitly state that charges can only be brought against a si tting royal (king or sultan) through a special court for crimes he may have committed in his personal capacity. Therefore, a king or sultan operating in his offici al capacity still receives prosecutorial immunity. To its detractors, ratifying the Rome Sta tute could provide the government an opportunity to completely remove the immunities. The fact that Mahathir\u2019s first tenure as prime minister saw confrontation between the royalty and the government serves as sufficient precedent for the detractors t o now believe that he may be attempting to further reduce royal influence and po wer. Since Mahathir grudgingly announced his intention t o withdraw from the ICC, the opposition to the Rome Statute appeared to have gat hered new life among certain quarters. Members of Parliament (MPs) from the oppo sition United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) stated that while the previous Barisan Nasional (BN) government studied the prospects of ratifying the R ome Statute since 2011, the then Attorney-General cautioned it against doing so as i t may contravene the federal constitution and that the Council of Rulers would n eed to be consulted. Thomas pointed out that the Najib administration de cided Malaysia ought to accede to the Rome Statute, but simply never followed thro ugh with it. Therefore, he claimed that the PH government was merely continuing a poli cy decision undertaken by the previous government. Former Prime Minister Najib Ra zak responded by stating that PH should have looked into why BN eventually refrai ned from bulldozing through the ratification of the treaty. Civil Society Reaction On 4 May 2019, a coalition of Muslim non-government al organisations, the Gerakan Pembela Ummah (Ummah), organised a rally to protest the Rome Statute. Depending on whose estimates are to be believed, between 1,00 0 and 10,000 participants turned up. Most were members of Ummah-linked NGOs, UMNO gr assroots members, and members of the opposition Parti Islam Se-Malaysia ( PAS). The detractors, which include pro-royalists, the po litical opposition, and some Muslim NGOs, have characterised the Rome Statute as an att ack, not just against the royalty, but against Malay-Muslim rights. To beef up this na rrative, Ummah used the 4 May rally to connect the Rome Statute with the death of the firefighter, Muhammad Adib Mohd Kassim, and reinforced the argument that PH ha s consistently undermined Malay-Muslim rights. The latest protest was not quite the scale of the a nti-ICERD rally, perhaps partly because counter-arguments from other quarters of ci vil society justifying the Rome Statute may have helped to deflect concerns. Nevert heless, PH inadvertently handed the opposition the initiative to, once again, criti cise its policies towards the rights of Islam and Malays. More Yet to Come? To observers, the claims that PH\u2019s tenure has under mined Malay-Muslim rights are clearly driven by political motives but they have g ained traction in some quarters. Similar rhetoric will likely be heard in the months ahead, especially since it seems to have been effective in forcing PH to backtrack on i ts reform agenda. Those opposed to PH would, however, have to be mindful not to all ow the rhetoric to go out of control. In retrospect, PH was perhaps a tad overzealous in its ratification of the Rome Statute. It would be prudent for PH to engage in deeper cons ultation with various stakeholders before proceeding with potentially divisive policie s. At the same time, consultations could also mean the policy-making will be slow and potentially held hostage to other issues. There is no easy solution but one thing for sure is that PH cannot afford too many backtracking episodes without losing its credibility. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY WITH THE digital economy evolving at breakneck spee d, countries are accelerating efforts to play regulatory catch-up and update the multilateral rulebook. Following e- commerce talks launched in January this year by the World Trade Organisation (WTO), various proposals for the future of digital trade architecture were discussed this May. What might a slate of new rules mean for digital de velopment prospects, going forward? With 76 of 164 WTO members participating, finding a middle ground between different development levels, along with degrees of complementary and conflicting interests, signal a long negotiating process. State of Play Current talks encompass both e-commerce (physical g oods transactions online) and digital trade (data-heavy goods and services). Thou gh broader consensus exists on e-commerce \u2014 whether in improving trade facilitatio n or helping micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) ride the e-commerce band wagon \u2014 preferences for data governance models are more mixed. Beyond gunning for greater privacy protection, the European Union (EU) advocates for free cross-border data flows, along with elimin ating data localisation and forced source code surrender practices in a bid to protect intellectual property rights (IPR). The United States (US), meanwhile, emphasises the same latter prefer ences, which would allow its technological corporations to conti nue expanding abroad and maintain their competitive edge in a progressively data-driv en global economy. Conversely, China has so far opted for a narrower focus on e-commerce in negotiations, favouring data localisation on securi ty grounds and eschewing deeper commitments on cross-border data liberalisation. Emerging Discourse Collectively, these hard-line positions could delay the compromise necessary to alleviate future trade tensions. Opposition is like ly if, for instance, Beijing drops out from ratifying most favoured nation (MFN) digital r ules, as its digital behemoths can harness global data flows without offering reciproc al access. Recent events also suggest an emerging discourse on viewing data governance through a development-focused lens. As concerns ove r technological hegemony and neo-colonialism fester, some developing countries q uestion what the push for binding rules, such as on implementing unfettered cross-bor der data liberalisation, in premature digital landscapes might mean for their political economy . For instance, various parties will argue over wheth er opening the data floodgates to Big Tech could detrimentally impact the development of local digital industry players who lack the same talent, capital and technological capabilities. WTO members like India have thus elected to abstain from negotiation s, reducing the prospects of a more inclusive global digital economy. Bigger Picture Yet more than digital trade rules alone will impact development prospects. Strict one- size-fits-all IPR regimes, for example, simultaneou sly facilitate foreign direct investment (FDI) from digital multinational corpora tions but hamper technology diffusion and knowledge spill-overs for innovation. Despite attempts to redesign the multilateral trade architecture that aim to contain China\u2019s ascent as a rising geo-technological compet itor and align its state capitalism model with liberal market ideas, the adverse knock- on effects for developing countries cannot be ruled out. The potential push for broad WTO reforms on industrial subsidies and state-owned enterprises (SOEs), for instance, could constrain t he growth of nascent information communication technology (ICT) sectors and digital players to a market-ready stage. Vietnam\u2019s 5G network developer Viettel , for instance, would not have gotten off the ground without initial access to military-controlle d finance . Coupled with bilateral actions like Washington\u2019s ex port controls on Chinese technology firms, these proposals pose questions fo r the fate of the Digital Silk Road (DSR) and consequently, the digital development for tunes linked to the spread of Chinese technology. Chinese SOEs and subsidised private actors like Hua wei Marine have been increasingly involved in building and purchasing critical information in frastructure, such as submarine cables for faster data transmissi on. Huawei\u2019s 5G network offerings have also elicited greater interest among developin g countries allegedly due to its subsidy-derived cost-effectiveness. Without alternative options, such as a Digital Mars hall Plan, climbing the rungs of the digital development ladder could become more challe nging for countries and wider regions, such as in ASEAN which has been relatively receptive towards Huawei and the DSR so far. Way Forward Ultimately, institutions are comprised of its membe rs. WTO member actions are hence critical to addressing concerns of inequality and e conomic power asymmetries both within and between countries in the digital age. First, engaging in greater dialogue and capacity-bu ilding \u2014 whether at the WTO or complementary multilateral institutions, such as th e G20\u2019s Osaka Track on global data governance \u2014 is pivotal to halt devolutions into pr otectionism. Abstaining from negotiations may send a message, but does not enric h nor realise difficult yet necessary conversations. Narrowing the development divide is also key; a lack of knowledge and capacity to compete could lead countr ies to opt for protectionism, an easier and politically expedient response. Second, trade rules should be applied with flexibil ities to enable public policy objectives\u2014 be it security, privacy, or development \u2014 though countries should abstain from using these goals as an aegis for protectionis m. Given the WTO\u2019s diverse membership, blanket regulations are less viable tha n hammering out interoperable digital rules with agreed distinctions between non- tariff measures versus non-tariff barriers and acceptable responses towards trade-dis torting digital practices. Third, members should minimise the impact of geopol itics in derailing technology\u2019s potential in delivering development. While curbing trade-distorting practices is necessary to level the playing field, reforms can b e done by using existing WTO rules rather than multilaterally or bilaterally changing the rules of the game. Current actions not only set risky precedents for rising powers, but alienate domestic reformist forces, inflame geopolitical tensions and may impinge upon pathways to digital prosperity. This is a tall order for ongoing WTO negotiations, given the need to not only bridge insecurity between developed and developing countri es, but also insecurity between proponents of different capitalisms and data govern ance rules \u2014 all of whom oppose the advantages each model bestows upon each other\u2019s economic players. The alternative, however, is a world of deepening d igital governance rifts and technological divides that undermine the continued, rules-based open exchange of ideas, labour, goods and services necessary to achi eve inclusive development in a digital age. A valiant attempt to forge a multilate ral digital trade consensus is thus not just the best option, but the only one. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY ALTHOUGH HIS overall popularity remains high, suppo rt for President Vladimir Putin in the last few years and months has declined, than ks to the state of the economy and falling living standards. Russia\u2019s economy has not been growing fast enough. In 2019, growth was at 1.3%; in 2020, it is projected to be 1.8%. Structural challenges, a conservative policy of macro-economic stability as well as Western sanctions have acted as brakes on higher growth rates. The resultant politico-social unrest, seen in 2018 and 2019, has stimulated Putin\u2019s need to act fast on the political front. It is in t his context that his recent constitutional proposals should be seen. They were not only to arr est the decline in his popularity but more so to introduce stability and especially, predictability into the post-Putin era and with that, secure his legacy for posterity. Planning for Political Changes In a nutshell, his proposals call for granting more power to the Duma and the State Council (currently an advisory body) and introducin g a two-term presidency. They also include the need for Russian law to prevail over in ternational law and treaties and finally, to limit high political and civil service offices to Russian citizens only who do not have permanent residency or another citizenship . The Duma expectedly approved the proposals in a fir st reading a week after his speech; no opposition is expected from the Upper Ho use as well. However, Putin has made it plain that the proposals must be approved in a national vote before he appends his signature to the proposa ls. It is noteworthy that they were submitted long befo re the September 2021 Duma elections. Dominated by the pro-government and pro- Putin United Russia (UR), which faces loyal opposition from the Communist Party, th e Liberal Democratic party and Just Russia party, President Putin cannot assume th at this political constellation will hold after September 2021, in the light of social a nd political discontent with UR. Hence, the proposals can be seen as an attempt to a ddress the concerns and dissatisfaction of growing numbers of the electorat e with the perceived lack of political discourse and freedom. Widespread Apathy The absence of mass demonstrations against the prop osals suggests that there is likely to be no serious street or \u201cnon-systemic opp osition\u201d, meaning political forces outside the parliamentary system. Thus far, the only sign of a planned protest by the non-systemic opposition is a scheduled demonstration at the end of February, to mark the fifth anniversary of the killing of Boris Nemtsov, a liberal politician. Exp ressions of opposition to the proposals are expected at this planned event. Political apathy and largely disillusionment with t he absence of real change after past demonstrations only partly explain this phenomenon. Of note is the fact that the youth of Russia today have known only Putin as president and have grown up under relatively prosperous and stable circumstances, unl ike their parents and grandparents. It is therefore not a surprise that a recent survey by VTSIOM, a state pollster, revealed that a majority of respondents (79%) consider the p roposals \u201crather important\u201d. New PM\u2019s Key Task About half the members of the Cabinet is from the p revious government; the new members are younger individuals with proven technoc ratic experience and qualifications as well as administrative skills. Th e new prime minister Mikhail Mishutin is known as a capable technocrat who established a well-run tax service. The overriding task of his government is to fully a nd successfully implement the National Projects (NPs), Putin\u2019s ambitious US$400 b illion programme to stimulate the economy and in the process, raise living standards. Former prime minister Dmitry Medvedev was seen to h ave failed to implement the NPs fast enough. Accomplishment of these objectives would cement Putin\u2019s legacy as post-Soviet Russia\u2019s longest-serving president. He would be seen as the leader who brought stabilit y and prosperity after the chaos in the aftermath of the USSR\u2019s collapse and who lai d the foundation of a stronger economy in a stable and predictable political syste m after 2024. Announced in May 2018 by him, the NPs are to be implemented by the e nd of his term of office in 2024. Veteran foreign minister Sergei Lavrov retained his post, a clear sign that there would be continuity in foreign policy. Probable Successor Mishutin was chosen by Putin to be prime minister i n a very calculated move and is his probable successor for the following reasons: First, he has the technocratic credentials to fully and successfully implement the NPs as well as raise the economic growth rates; so do t he new and current members of his Cabinet. His fluency in the English language could not but be noticed by Putin. Such a facility would mean easier access and direct communication with the United States, regarded as the most important country (des pite oft-repeated protestations of close and vital links with China) and \u201cmain opponen t\u201d of Russia. Second, Mishutin does not have any known links to R ussia\u2019s powerful interest groups such as the siloviki or top security establishment officials and heads of powerful state corporations. Hence, Putin need not balance the int erests of these groups; were he a member of either of them, Putin would have to spend political capital and time on such a task. Moreover, Mishutin would not be seen as \u201cold wine i n a new bottle\u201d by the electorate. In this regard, he fits the bill of having new face s at the helm of power. Fourth, being a political unknown without any expre ssed political ambitions, he is not considered a threat by either Putin or the powerful interest groups. In that regard, Putin would be more at ease handing over power to Mishuti n. Elder Statesman? Earlier speculation that Putin might assume the lea dership of a restructured State Council with extensive powers has thus far proved g roundless. Nevertheless, it is quite certain that he does not intend to remain in office till his death, as had been the case in the Soviet era. He made thi s clear to World War II veterans in St Petersburg just three days after his State-of -the-Nation speech in which he outlined his constitutional proposals. A few days later, he pointed out that a role like t hat of the late Minister Mentor, Lee Kuan Yew, \u201cis not applicable to Russia\u201d as it \u201cwoul d undermine the institution of the presidency,\u201d insisting that Russia must remain a \u201cs trong presidential republic\u201d. Latest media reports that a government commission h as proposed the title of \u201cSupreme Leader\u201d for the position of head of state, have further added to all the speculation about his political future after 2024. His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov was reported to have said that the president had no vie w on the proposal. There is, nevertheless, no doubt that he would assu me a role after he steps down from power. Only the form, structure and extent of that role\u2019s powers remain to be seen. ",

    "context": "Commentary ASEAN\u2019S 50th anniversary is an opportune time for t he grouping to pursue regional initiatives for public goods. The economic integrat ion of ASEAN and the increased policy attention to inclusive growth of ASEAN shoul d be accompanied by stronger actions for the broader well-being of the ASEAN pop ulation and the community at large. One of these issues is the emerging danger of infec tions arising from mutated bacteria or Superbug. The United Nations, the World Health O rganisation (WHO) and the Davos World Economic Forum have constantly \u2013 but es pecially over the latest two years - alerted the global community to this. Due t o the poor antibiotic stewardship in the last few decades, most countries are now way be hind the mutation curve in combating the Superbug in the development of new dr ugs. What is the Superbug? Following the invention of antibiotics in early 194 0s, these medications have been used in humans for treatment and prevention of bact erial infections. Initially, antibiotics were administered to livestock for therapeutic purp oses. With the increase in factory farming, antibiotics w ere added to animal feed around 1950 to enhance growth rate of livestock. Over time , such practice is found almost globally. Currently, of the estimated 70% of all an tibiotics administered for livestock, the bulk are for non-therapeutic purposes (this pra ctice has been banned in the European Union since 2006). Even as a waste product, these antibiotics retain m ost of their potency as around 80- 90% of all antibiotics ingested by both humans and livestock are not broken down in the passage through the body and enter the environm ent as waste. They are also able to affect bacteria and promote antibiotic resistanc e even after they enter the soil or water. The aggressive and extensive use of antibiotics, ov er time, in both human and livestock creates mutation in bacteria and other mi crobes, leading to the elimination of the effectiveness of drugs to cure or prevent infec tions. This mutation is known as antimicrobial resistance, AMR or commonly described as the Superbug. Be Mindful of the Superbug Antimicrobial resistant genes have penetrated the b acterial population in the spheres where antibiotics are used--in hospitals, farms and aquaculture. The Superbug is taking root everywhere in the world today, compromi sing our ability to treat infectious diseases, as well as undermining many other advance s in health and medicine. Without effective antimicrobials for treatment and prevention of infections, one\u2019s immunity will be compromised. Infections from surgi cal procedures such as transplants, caesarean sections or hip replacements and infection in immuno- compromised patients following chemotherapy for can cer treatment, will likely result in prolonged illness, disability, and death. While dangerous, the slow and steady march of antib iotic resistance does not cause people to bleed to death in the streets, the way Eb ola virus does; neither does it cause heart-rending birth defects, the way Zika virus doe s. The slow speed of this catastrophe could perhaps indirectly create a false sense of security. In short, both humans and livestock farming are in danger; and the issues of food security and safety are called into question. ASEAN Should Act On AMR AMR is a global problem that cannot be contained na tionally or regionally -- universal adoption is the ultimate goal. With this in mind, w e urge ASEAN leaders to start and commit to a multi-year, multi-front concrete collec tive plan against AMR before ASEAN is severely affected by the flood of AMR: Individual Member State Level All Member States of ASEAN should introduce immedia te measures to educate residents on the importance of personal health. Als o important is having a long-term public health education drive, boosted with a champ ion on infection prevention and control. The aim is to minimise the need for antibi otics and identify alternative approaches such as vaccination (e.g. against pneumo coccal infections, cholera, and typhoid fever). Simultaneously, all ASEAN Member States should intr oduce national farmer education to ensure all farmers are well informed o n the consequences of the emergence of AMR for both humans and animals. In pa rallel, all ASEAN Member States should pass legislation and enforcement to c ontrol antibiotic use and sales, and provide access to clean water and sanitation. Dual-surveillance system Given the close and frequent movements of people an d food within ASEAN, and the mobility of mutated microbes from bacterium to bact erium, all ASEAN Member States could undertake and implement AMR monitoring at ind ividual Member State level & ASEAN wide. For the action plan against AMR to be effective, we need to move beyond individual national action plans to pursue a pan-ASEAN surveil lance system for AMR monitoring. With the proliferation of the Next-Generation Seque ncing methodology in the regional labs, this proposed surveillance system contains a regional database of all DNA sequences for AMR microorganisms, with data sharing protocols to facilitate data",

    "context": "Commentary ASEAN PROVIDES the Southeast Asian region with a st rategic umbrella for important economic, political, security and socio-cultural in itiatives. The ASEAN experience has demonstrated that it offers a successful and progre ssive model of regional cooperation in disaster management. It is most notable in disas ter response where the ten ASEAN member states have come together to provide a regio nal coordination mechanism for disaster relief. In 2011, the ASEAN Coordinating Centre on Humanitar ian Assistance on disaster management (AHA Centre) was established -- a signif icant milestone in regional cooperation on disaster response and disaster manag ement. Five years on, reflecting on its successes, three key elements can be identif ied \u2013 political will, operational capacity and emotional bonds \u2013 that were critical t o regional cooperation in disaster response. Political Commitment Since the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami killed an estim ated 230,000-280,000 people and devastated coastal communities in 14 countries, the ten ASEAN member states have solidified their political commitment to disas ter management. The ASEAN Agreement on Disaster Management and Emergency Resp onse (AADMER) was signed on 26 July 2005 in Vientiane, Laos \u2013 six mon ths after the tsunami \u2013 which was a quick turnaround for a regional agreement. It ref lected the scale of the disaster and the political will to cooperate in such a crisis. The AADMER was essentially the political and legal commitment to deepen cooperation on disaster management in the region. E mbodied in the agreement was the commitment to establish the AHA Centre. The agr eement came into legal force in 2009, and the AHA Centre was established two years later in Jakarta. This was made possible by the agreement to set up the AHA Centre signed at the ASEAN Summit in Bali, Indonesia in November 2011. More recently, in 2015 ASEAN member states unveiled the ASEAN Vision 2025 on disaster management, which outlined what the region should achieve in the next decade. In 2016, to achieve faster, bigger, and uni fied response towards disasters, Leaders signed the ASEAN declaration on One ASEAN O ne Response: responding to disaster as one, in the region and outside. Operational Engine After the AHA Centre was established in 2011 it bec ame the full-time \u201coperational engine\u201d to turn political commitment, policies and decisions into action. It operates multiple aspects of coordination such as informatio n management, operating procedures, regional response planning, resource mo bilisation including the emergency response fund, the ASEAN Emergency Respon se and Assessment Team (ASEAN-ERAT), and the Disaster Emergency Logistics System for ASEAN (DELSA). These form the main operational mechanism and instr uments of disaster response at the regional level. The AHA Centre has the mandate, the mechanism and the funding to turn words into action. This all came about because practitioners equipped with an emergency mindset sit together on the ASEAN Committee on Disaster Managem ent (ACDM) which focuses on execution and delivering fast tangible results. It is this committee that designed and governs the AHA Centre. Emotional Bonds Disaster management is a prime example of a people- to-people connection in ASEAN. In an ASEAN disaster response, the ASEAN-ERAT train together, deploy together and have their own network for keeping in contact. Simi larly, the AHA Centre Executive (ACE) programme lasts for a six-month period during which time strong bonds of friendship develop. The ACDM and its working groups also build trusting relationships and friendships through numerous meetings and events including the ASEAN Regional Disaster Emergency Response Simulation Exercise (ARDEX). Thi s emotional bonding instills the \u201cwe feeling\u201d because as soon as disaster strike s the responders are not meeting strangers but friends. This is a unique element of regional cooperation in disaster response as it is much easier to work with people y ou know and trust. These three elements \u2013 political will, operational capacity and emotional bonds \u2013 are mutually reinforcing. If invested together these th ree components are well placed for successful regional cooperation in the field of dis aster management. Seven More Years to Vision 2025 Scanning the horizon, it is important to recognise that there are seven years left to achieve ASEAN Vision 2025 to become a global leader in disaster management. ASEAN is well-placed to make this happen through sh aring its expertise outside the region, developing stronger links with universities and think tanks like RSIS to provide global thought leadership on disaster management, a nd continue to build trust and capacity in ASEAN on disaster management. However, it is important to consider two issues tha t will determine the future of the AHA Centre. The first is to ensure adequate financi al contributions by member states to enhance the sustainability and the capacity of t he AHA Centre. The second is the future role and function of the AHA Centre as it co ordinates regional response beyond natural disasters. Going forward, it is also important for the AHA Cen tre to remain focused on operations, continue to maintain the trust and confidence of th e ASEAN member states, and for the ACDM to remain in the driving seat. It is important to continue the momentum ASEAN has generated to reach its stated aim of becoming a global leader in disaster managem ent by 2025. It is a bold, ambitious and important vision that will transform ASEAN and ensure it stays relevant not only in the region but also in the world in dis aster management. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY THE GLOBAL economy has been through turbulence in re cent years. First, the administration of President Trump disrupted the liberal international economy as we knew it with its \u2018America first\u2019 approach to foreign economic policies. Then came the COVID -19 pandemic in 2020. It is too early to claim that the e nd of the tunnel is getting near; but the recent election of President Biden and the on -going roll -out of COVID -19 vaccines should embolden policymakers to look ahead to a post -crises era. For the ASEAN economies, three inter-related issues will be importa nt in this context: international economic cooperation; economic resilience and security; and the geopolitical rivalry between China and the US. Weakening of International Economic Cooperation Almost all ASEAN economies have historically relied on integ ration with the global economy to develop their economies, lift their standards of living and, for some, also legitimise their domestic political order. \u2018Export -led growth\u2019 necessarily requires an international environment that is relatively stable and o perates to a great extent on commonly accepted rules and practices, all of which require the active support and cooperation of international economic partners. These conditions have come under significant strain in recent years. On the one hand, the exis ting rules have not kept up with the evolution of the global economy. New areas such as the emergence and rapid growth of the digital economy have posed challenges to existing rules which were developed in an earlier analogue - dominant era. The intersection between contemporary \u2018national security\u2019 concerns and international trade is also poorly addressed by existing agreements. Then, there are established rules that are no longer effective in achieving their intended goals because of \u2018slippages\u2019 in enforce ment or changes on the ground. On the other hand, certain key actors have chosen to turn their back against international cooperation and established rules. The predilection of the Trump administration to adopt unilateral measures to address concerns ove r trade balance and national security has antagonised trade partners and led them to question US\u2019 commitment to the liberal internation al economic order. Elsewhere, there is a growing chorus against China\u2019s use of \u2018economic coercion\u2019 to advance its economic and political interests. Geopolitics & ASEAN\u2019s \u2018Wicked Problem\u2019 The liberal international economic order has also come under pressu re from the recent re-emergence of geopolitical rivalry. For almost 30 years, the global economy experienced what in hindsight might be called the \u2018golden era\u2019 of globalisation that took off when the Cold War ended in 1991. While this period had not been without conflict, most of these were addressed within established and agreed multilateral frameworks. That idyll came increasingly under threat as China\u2019s economy grew and its geopolitical ambitions became clearer. Nevertheless, it was not until Trump b ecame president that the idyll was loudly shattered and replaced at the very front and centre with the economic and political rivalry between China and the US. This has presented ASEAN economies with a \u2018wicked problem\u2019. They are deeply entangled economica lly with both China and the US through complex production chains , albeit with variations in their individual intensities. Both great powers are major sources of investment, technology and exp ort income. For a handful of ASEAN economies, the US is also a key security ally. ASEAN economies would prefer to contain the China -US rivalry and not have to choose sides. Nevertheless, it is probably true that \u201c it is unlikely that the non -alignment playbook can be conveniently revived \u201d by members of ASEAN. Consequently, the economic fortunes of ASEAN economies would likely change should this geopo litical rivalry continue to escalate, and they are forced to stake a position. While one or two might benefit from unexpected opportunities that might emerge , all would almost certainly be economically worse off in the longer term compared with a situation where there might be greater harmony between the two major powers. Economic Resilience and Security The COVID -19 pandemic and the China -US geopolitical riv alry have raise two issues that threaten to further weaken the international liberal economic order: economic resilience and economic security. These have arguably evolved from the earlier notion of \u2018decoupling\u2019 that became popular when Trump first launche d his \u2018trade -war\u2019. Many soon realised that global production systems were far too complex, integrated and geographically dispersed to be decoupled completely, an observation that was reinforced during the COVID -19 pandemic. Furthermore, while decouplin g from the Chinese economy might suit the US, it does not necessarily suit the bottomline of many American, and other, firms . The focus on \u2018decoupling\u2019 thus shifted to risk management and the ability to withstand uncertain and unexpected shocks . Although it is tempting, it would be mistaken to believe that an inward -looking approach to economic policy would help address national concerns over economic resilience and security. With one or two exceptions, most countries do not have the ability or capacity to be self-sufficie nt without incurring significant costs. Identifying all vulnerable areas and all sources of vulnerability are also mammoth tasks. In practice, economic resilience and security are best achieved through partnership with others, and therein lies the tensio n: concerns over economic resilience and security first arose out of inefficiencies and dysfunctionality in the liberal international economic order; yet the former cannot really be addressed without recourse to some form of international cooperation. How Should ASEAN Build a Post -Crises Economy? ASEAN\u2019s economic interests would be best served with a rejuvenated open international economic order. This could be achieved by engaging (major) economic partners to re -commit to international cooperation, uphold international rules and norms, work on updating existing rules, and develop new rules and new approaches to meet current needs and new challenges. These efforts, while necessary, would however be limited if the China -US geopolitical rivalry, which is in creasingly the main obstacle to greater global economic prosperity, is not addressed. While ASEAN economies\u2019 ability to influence this relationship is admittedly limited, their interests are nevertheless probably best served by taking active measures to fa cilitate and encourage d\u00e9tente or even rapprochement between the two major powers. Standing back and watching this geopolitical rivalry from the sidelines will probably not serve ASEAN economies\u2019 interests well. Without some resolution to this rivalry, i t is increasingly likely that we will enter another period of crisis rather than move into a post-crises economic era. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY Indonesian pro -Islamic State (IS) terrorist organisations are significantly less lethal today than in the recent past. Largely due to the mass arrest of senior leaders in 2018, well-known organisations like the Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) are now decentralised, leaving their cells unable to formulate a common strategy and to mobilise resources collectively . Consequently, the frequency and lethality of pro -IS attacks have declined significantly. In 2022, Indonesia experienced only one attack by JAD \u2013 the Astana Raya Bombing \u2013 which resulted in ten casualties . Notably, this attack was significantly less lethal than its earlier attacks, such as the 2018 Triple Church Bombings in Surabaya which caused 58 casualties. Despite their declining operational capacity, pro -IS groups have shown a degree of resilience in their ability to recruit members and to establish new cells. A report by the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC) noted as of 2020, that pro -IS cells continued to emerge in areas that \u201chad no recent history of terrorism\u201d. These included Pohuwanto, Gorontalo, whe re seven pro -IS men were arrested for plotting attacks, and Banjar Baru, South Kalimantan, where attack preparations were plotted. In 2021, new pro -IS cells were still forming in Nganjuk, East Java. To better understand how pro -IS cells are being regenerated, this author examined 996 court documents of terrorists arrested and convicted between 2011 and 2021. Relevant information about them were stored in the Indonesian Terrorist Inmate (ITI) Dataset, which has been helpful in our understanding of the radicalisation pathways, organisational careers, and violent operations of convicted Indonesian terrorists. The analysi s in this commentary is based on 235 cases involving members of pro -IS cells and groups arrested in 2018 (182 cases) and 2021 (53 cases). They included members from pro -IS groups such as JAD, Jemaah Darussalam al Mubaroqah, and Anshor Daulah Villa Mutiara. Indonesian Pro -IS Terrorists\u2019 Radicalisation Patterns Based on information from the ITI Dataset, two radicalisation patterns among pro -IS organisations were observed to persist between 2018 and 2021. First, it was observed that most of their members wer e radicalised offline even though they were savvy with social media and the Internet. In 2018, the data showed that 67 per cent of Indonesian pro -IS supporters were radicalised through offline processes. They were mostly influenced at mosque sermons delive red by extremist ulamas (religious scholars and teachers) and at radical Quranic recital groups, both being the starting point of 80 per cent of offline radicalisation cases in 2018. While some were radicalised online by propaganda disseminated through Fa cebook and Telegram, most of them were concurrently influenced offline by extremist sermons and Quranic recital groups. In most instances, the commitment to the IS cause that developed online became stronger, manifesting into action only after it was reinf orced by group activities \u2013 as in the case of JAD Bogor and Bekasi members, Baban and Iswahyudi . Overall, the data showed that only 9 per cent of pro -IS radicalisations in 2018 took place exclusively online. Offline radicalisation of pro -IS supporters was also prevalent in 2021. Notably, about 60 per cent of those arrested in 2021 were radicalised through solely offline means. As in 2018, mosques and private Quranic groups were the most common starting point of an individual's radicalisation, accounting for 86 per cent of all offline radicalisation cases in 2021. A lthough the proportion of pro -IS supporters radicalised online increased from 35 per cent in 2018 to 40 per cent in 2021, many were still simultaneously involved in offline processes as well. Overall, purely online radicalisation occurred in only 13 per ce nt of cases in 2021. The second pattern that persisted in 2018 and 2021 was the role of social ties in facilitating the radicalisation process. Despite some claims that online self - radicalisation is a major threat, data actually suggested that most members of pro -IS terrorist organisations were radicalised either by or with someone they were personally familiar with. Data from the ITI Dataset foun d that 73 per cent of all pro -IS supporters who were arrested in 2018 had a social relationship with another supporter who facilitated their radicalisation process. In 2021, this percentage remained high at 77 per cent. The data also showed that the most common social ties which facilitated radicalisations were the individuals\u2019 relationships with their ulamas followed by friendships and family ties. In 2018, 32 per cent of the people radicalised involved a radical ulama they were close to, and 22 per cent involved introduction to radical materials by a friend or family member who was part of or on the way to joining a pro - IS group. In 2021, these numbers remained about the same, with 34 per cent involving radical ulamas and 28 per cent involving a friend or family member. The case of the Anshor Daulah Villa Mutiara group highlights the significance of social ties in the radicalisation of pro -IS supporters. This group, located in Makassar, South Sulawesi, was brought together by Rizaldy whose radicalisation was facilitated by Ustad Basri, his ulama while he was a member of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI). Rizaldy es tablished private Quranic recital groups and invited his siblings, their spouses, and former FPI colleagues to participate. Even tually, the group expanded to 80 people and its most infamous terrorist couples, Ulfa and Rullie along with Lukman and Dewi, went on to perpetuate, respectively, the 2019 Jolo c athedral bombing and the 2021 Makassar bombing . Looking Ahead In view of the persistent patterns of offline radicalisations involving social networks observed in 2018 and 2021, it is likely that these trends are still prevalent today. It is therefore vital for the Indonesian government to conduct two things. Firstly, it needs to collaborate with and expand the reach of civil society groups involved in the battle against extremism in offline settings. Secondly, it needs to coordinate with and support \u201cPreventing and Countering Violent Extremism (P/CVE)\u201d organisations in implementing a \u201c whole of society \u201d approach to identify and to intervene early in radicalisation processes. It is important, however, that this focus on offline radicalisation is not done at the expense of combating online radic alisation. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY IN RECENT weeks, seasonal summer rains wrought unprecedented havoc in Germany, Belgium, Austria and many places nearby. Scenes televised and shared around the world showed quaint once -picturesque towns upended by massive currents of mud and burst riverbanks. Whole houses, shops, main streets, community facilities and cars were swept away as if they were flimsy toys in the face of nature\u2019s fierce tempest. News editorials and reporters on the ground spontaneously chorused a universal question: why were their governments neglectful of preparing for this tragedy? Worse, both pictures and utterances of disbelief at the sheer damage wrought by nature implied that sovereign power was helpless against th e wrath of wind, rain and flood. In the pan -Asian region stretching from Pakistan in the west, threading through Indonesia and northwards towards Indochina, China, the Korean Peninsula and Japan, Europe\u2019s recent devastation is like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Throughout Asia , natural disasters have been annual contenders for the position of biggest national security threat. But how should the policy and scholarly communities rethink the \u2018international relations\u2019 of sovereign states? Refocus on the Social Contract States ha ve long been assumed to operate according to the ideal of possessing a clearly demarcated political border, containing an identifiable population, both border in turn ruled by a government. A government in control of border and population is described as p ossessing sovereignty \u2013 a legal condition that implies there are no serious and material challenges to that government\u2019s monopoly of power and legitimate authority. Under both constitutional and political definitions, sovereignty is supposed to be employ ed by rulers to protect the population by defending the border. This clearly did not apply when the rains and floods came for the German towns last week, and perennially for most of monsoon -vulnerable Asia. What sovereignty must address going forward is th e re-evaluation of the social contract that undergirds sovereignty. The population \u2013 or preferably \u2018We the People\u2019 \u2013 consent to that very sovereignty in an exchange relationship. The government is elected, or assigned authority and power by alternative m eans as it may be the case in some authoritarian states, on the basis that the people obtain protection within the sovereign state from all threats to life, liberty and prosperity to the fullest extent possible. When the foundations of the present Westph alian -based world order were derived in the 1600s, the European political powers of the day were concerned with thwarting religious zealotry and imposition, as well as territorial grabs by neighbours. Commerce quickly emerged soon after as another reason f or sovereignty: government needed to order the markets through laws of equity, transparency and assurance. Now one\u2019s life, liberty, property and economic livelihoods are being rendered equally risky by the forces of nature. In short, the sovereign state needs to expand the moral and legal foundations of its social contract by admitting to the insecurities of the human person arising from nature\u2019s caprice. The latter can be named as the usual ecological suspects: global warming, overconsumption of biodiver sity and natural resources, and the release of industrially produced gases that upset the chemical equilibrium of Planet Earth\u2019s air. Interdependent Consequences Take global warming for instance. This is an international relations issue because it is possible today to measure nationally emitted industrial pollution in terms of volumes of specific oxide gases and the well -known carbon emissions. States can therefore be ranked in terms of pollution severity. The cumulative trajectories arising from the UN Conference on Environment and Development\u2019s (UNCED) \u2018Earth Summit\u2019 in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, produced the equivalent of an acknowledgement by virtually every sovereign state that the warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere was a collective responsibility of al l governments. This was also symptomatic of what political scientists have termed the tragedy of the commons. If no state owned up to being a contributor to a planetary problem, global warming will only be compounded by every sovereign state\u2019s insistence on unilateral interpretations, or worse, neglect of a common malaise. But global warming has border crossing consequences. Every sovereign state will be affected by every other sovereign state\u2019s policies governing their national pollution. The unevenness of each set of national policies cannot but compound the problem of an excess in discharge of toxic gases that erode the natural composition of breathable air through the disruption of the various atmospheric layers enclosing the Earth. The build -up of toxic gasses traps heat within the Earth and in turn disturbs the natural movement of air masses. This in turn triggers extreme weather events like the exceptionally heavy thunderstorms in Europe, and the increasing frequency of tropical cyclones in Asia. It goes without saying that no single sovereign authority can eliminate extreme weather threats to each and every member of their socially contracted citizenry. There is sufficient moral and rational reasoning to embrace the idea that human security is a n idea whose time has come. And it is urgent because global warming has produced a situation of interdependent consequences for every human being because of industrial activities occurring in every sovereign territory. Human Security: Security Policy for Climate Change Sovereign states must confront extreme weather events by rethinking the moral and pragmatic purposes of international relations. Unfortunately, the time honoured saying that something is as unpredictable as the weather has still stuck in th e minds of old - fashioned sovereignty -bound politicians. Enlightened leadership of today\u2019s complex industrialised nation -states needs to appreciate that human security is upon us. The ability to rehabilitate the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, for instance, must mean that every human being regardless of whichever region they are located in, is synonymous with the security of every citizen. The social contract that enables sovereignty to stand must include humanity\u2019s self - preservation in its ultimate sense of becomin g security policy. Europe\u2019s latest thunderstorm \u2013 inflicted human miseries have joined Asia\u2019s climate -induced population displacements in a global community of fate. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY SERGEI LAVROV, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, met President Joko Widodo and held talks with his counterpart, Retno Marsudi, during a goodwill visit to Indonesia on 5 -7 July 2021. Following this, he travelled to Laos where he met President Thongloun Sisoulith, Prime Minister Phankham Viphavanh and Foreign Minister Saleumxay Kommasith. While Lavrov\u2019s visits to Indonesia and Laos were meant to serve bilateral objectives, his attendance, via a videoconference, at a Special ASEAN -Russia Ministerial Meeting on the occasion of th e 25th anniversary of ASEAN -Russia Dialogue Partnership, also signalled Russia\u2019s keen interest in maintaining the momentum of Russia -ASEAN relations. Russian -Indonesian Relations In his statement at a joint press conference with Marsudi in Jakarta, Lavr ov described Indonesia as one of Russia\u2019s key partners, especially in the Asia -Pacific. He also stated that both countries\u2019 leaders planned to meet and sign a declaration on strategic partnership. In the economic field, Lavrov pointed out that trade with Indonesia had risen almost 25% in the first four months of 2021 and that both sides would diversify trade through the expansion of cooperation in high -tech products. Both countries were ready to convene the 13th meeting of the Russian -Indonesian Joint C ommission on Trade, Economic and Technical Cooperation and to start negotiations between Indonesia and the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) on a free trade agreement (FTA). (The EEU is led by Russia and comprises Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan). On efforts to deal with the COVID -19 pandemic, Lavrov disclosed that Russia was ready \u201cto closely cooperate with Indonesia, including the possibility not only of supplying vaccines but also to discuss localisation of their production on Indonesian soil\u201d. Both countries said they \u201cwere convinced that vaccines must be accessible to the entire international community\u201d. Russian -Laotian Relations In Vientiane, during a joint press conference with his Lao counterpart on 7 July, Lavrov highlighted the strength of their bilateral relationship. This was on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the Russian -Lao Declaration on Strategic Partnership in the Asia Pacific Region. Both countries pledged to expand the parameters of their trade and economic ties and would hold a meeting of the Russian -Lao Intergovernmental Commission on Trade, Economic, Scientific and Technological Cooperation before the end of 2021. The commission was to address how the two sides could \u201cconsiderably expand our economic and investment co operation\u201d. Russian -Lao ties in the military and military -technical cooperation were also highlighted by Lavrov, including \u201cthe planned deliveries of additional military equipment and materiel to Laos\u201d. Russia would also be delivering the Sputnik V vac cine to Laos, and review a Laotian request that \u201cin addition to commercial deliveries, a part of the vaccines be shipped as humanitarian relief\u201d. Russia -ASEAN Relations During his joint press conference with Marsudi in Jakarta, Lavrov pointed out that \u201cthere was no alternative to the principles of ASEAN centrality\u201d. He pledged Russia\u2019s commitment to \u201cconsistently defend the positions taken by ASEAN,\u201d and declared that \u201call extra -regional countries should respect the traditions of this region supported by ASEAN\u2019s central role\u201d. In an interview with Rakyat Merdeka, an Indonesian newspaper, which was posted on the Russian foreign ministry website on 6 July, Lavrov noted the decades of Russia - ASEAN relations which were raised to the level of strategic partner ship in 2018. Lavrov was candid, however, in observing that \u201cunfortunately, the potential of economic cooperation is far from fully realised,\u201d while noting that a \u201cgrowth trend has reappeared this year\u201d. The promotion of cooperation with the EEU would mak e this trend \u201cmore dynamic\u201d, pointing out the EEU\u2019s FTAs with Vietnam and Singapore, with Indonesia working on this as well. Although over two million Russian tourists had visited Southeast Asia before the COVID -19 pandemic, Lavrov lamented that \u201cwe still do not know enough about each other\u201d. The development of humanitarian ties was designed to fill in this gap, citing the establishment of the ASEAN Centre in Moscow as well as a network of Russia -ASEAN research centres. Russia -ASEAN youth summits were a lso held in this context while the Russia -ASEAN Business Council facilitated the expansion of contacts between entrepreneurs of both sides. On Myanmar, Lavrov stressed that \u201cin our contacts with the Myanmar military leaders, we promote the position of ASE AN which, in our view, should be considered as a basis for resolving this crisis and bringing the situation back to normalcy\u201d. He also said he \u201cbriefed our Indonesian friends about our messages which we send to Naypyidaw in line with the principles develop ed by ASEAN\u201d. Assessing Lavrov\u2019s Three Objectives Lavrov\u2019s July trip to Southeast Asia served three inter -related objectives: first, to show - the-flag and remind ASEAN that Russia is serious about maintaining and strengthening relations; second , to le nd credibility to Russia\u2019s oft -declared interest in ASEAN; and third, to impress upon Southeast Asia that Russia\u2019s foreign policy interest in the Asia -Pacific, which has been very China -focussed, was diversified, tangible and pertinent. These objectives h ave largely been met despite the limited media coverage of Lavrov\u2019s visit to Indonesia and Laos. The reality is that by virtue of their stronger economic links and long -standing political interactions with Southeast Asia, China and the United States woul d continue to loom large in ASEAN\u2019s consciousness and concrete cooperation, when compared to Russia. In assessing Lavrov\u2019s visits, a keen Russian observer of Southeast Asia, Dmitry Mosyakov, the head of the Southeast Asia Department at the Russian Academ y of Sciences\u2019 Institute for Oriental Studies, said Russia could act as some kind of \u201can independent arbitrator\u201d that supports Southeast Asian countries\u2019 vision of the future of the Asia -Pacific region. In his view, the ASEAN countries\u2019 traditional balan cing policy between the US and China was becoming difficult to pursue, amid rising tensions between the two powers. However, Mosyakov may be too optimistic. It is unlikely that Russia could play such a role, even if it sought to do so. This is not only d ue to its comparatively weak (vis -\u00e0-vis China and the US) economic and other links with ASEAN. It is also because Russia\u2019s close ties with China and estranged relations with the US would inhibit Moscow from being able to function as an independent and effe ctive arbitrator. Since Russia -ASEAN economic ties have yet to assume their full potential, the task ahead for both sides would be to continue striving towards establishing a more meaningful economic relationship, which would then make for an even strong er political linkage.

    "context": "Commentary PRESIDENT VLADIMIR Putin\u2019s State of the Nation addr ess to the Federal Assembly (FA), Russia\u2019s national legislature, not only laid out details of the socio-economic challenges facing the country. In a not-so-subtle m essage, it significantly also unveiled a new generation of weapons and technology which co uld neutralise the global missile defence system of the United States. It was to be expected that more attention was given to Russia\u2019s socio-economic challenges in a speech that was dominated by domest ic issues, coming just days before the presidential election on 18 March 2018. But when he did touch on foreign policy, Putin\u2019s message was unsurprisingly tough. Putin\u2019s Strong-man Posture Putin wanted to stress that while Russia is interes ted in \u201cnormal and constructive cooperation with the US and EU\u201d, it would not allow itself to be dictated to. Western pressure in the form of economic sanctions; the bui ld-up of NATO forces and infrastructure close to Russia\u2019s borders; and the U S\u2019 global missile defence shield; etc would not alter Russian policy. The blame for the current state of Russo-Western re lations was placed on the West, specifically the US for its withdrawal from the Ant i-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, which he described \u201cas the cornerstone of the inter national security system\u201d. Putin also cited NATO expansion to the east and the establishment of missile defence systems in Romania and Poland as reasons for develo ping and eventually deploying its new generation of weapons and technology. He pointedly criticised the West for taking advanta ge of post-Soviet Russia\u2019s weakness. He stressed the fact that after the colla pse of the USSR, Russia \u201clost 23.8 percent of its national territory, 48.5 percent of its population, 41 of the GDP, 39.4 percent of its industrial potential (nearly half of our potential, I would underscore), as well as 44.6 percent of its military capability due to the division of the Soviet Armed Forces among the former Soviet republics\u201d. In addition, he said: \u201cThe military equipment of th e Russian army was becoming obsolete, and the Armed Forces were in a sorry stat e. A civil war was raging in the Caucasus, and US inspectors oversaw the operation o f our leading uranium enrichment plants.\u201d Still Open to Better Relations Putin noted it had been assumed that Russia would n ot \u201ceven be able to safely store and maintain the nuclear weapons that we inherited after the collapse of the USSR. Russia had outstanding debts, its economy could not function without loans from the IMF and the World Bank; the social sphere was impos sible to sustain.\u201d The West, he argued \u201cgot the impression that it was impossible in the foreseeable historical perspective for our country to revive it s economy, industry, defence industry and Armed Forces to levels supporting the necessary strategic potential. And if that is the case, there is no point in reckoning with Russi a\u2019s opinion, it is necessary to further pursue ultimate unilateral military advantage in or der to dictate the terms in every sphere in the future\u201d. Putin however made it clear that he was not closing the door to future negotiations on improving the relationship with the West, noting th at \u201cwe hope common sense will prevail and our partners will opt for honest and eq ual work together\u201d. Putin\u2019s Strategic Goals His speech served both domestic and foreign policy purposes. First, it outlined his vision for the next presiden tial term of office and was obviously meant for the electorate. While conventional wisdom states that Putin would emerge the victor, he himself is known to be a thorough in dividual and never takes matters for granted. In fact, his speech focused more on domest ic social and economic issues than foreign policy challenges. Second, with respect to foreign policy, his message s in the speech were directed primarily to the US and subtly to China. The messag e was simply this: Russian military strength cannot be dismissed as irrelevant; hence, Russian interests must be taken into account on issues like nuclear parity and NATO expansion. Third, his messages were meant for the Russian peop le who have never really reconciled themselves to seeing their country as an ything less than a global superpower. Finally, his speech also had a larger audience \u2013 th e global community. It was meant to show the world that despite Western sanctions, R ussia has not and will not collapse. The last two decades or so of Putin\u2019s rule have see n him successfully rebuild Russia\u2019s strength to restore the country\u2019s place in the sun. Implications for ASEAN The continuing tension and apparent stalemate in Ru sso-Western relations do not serve the overall interests of Southeast Asia which enjoys good ties with both sides. If tense Russo-Western relations were to spill over in to the economic realm of their relationship with Southeast Asia, then obviously th e latter will suffer as well. Moreover, the possibility exists that the more diff icult the relationship becomes for both sides, the more they might be inclined or feel forc ed to bring their disputes into this part of the world; they might try to seek advantage s over each other, either bilaterally with Southeast Asian countries or with ASEAN as a w hole. That would complicate the already apparent competition between the US and Chi na in the region. Unfortunately, as things stand now, Southeast Asia\u2019 s good ties with both sides do not allow it to play an honest broker\u2019s role. It is not a reflection of Southeast Asia\u2019s irrelevance to the larger currents of international developments but more a manifestation of the reality that the great powers\u2019 differences sometimes do not lend themselves to outside mediation.

    "context": "Commentary THE CONNECTION between modernity, fundamentalism an d violence can help us better understand why an increasing number of indiv iduals from the privileged class are involved in terrorism. The detention of educate d Singaporeans who hold good jobs in a First World country, and who embrace modernity , is a case in point. It no longer holds true that actors of terrorism ar e the \u201cdown and out\u201d who are disenfranchised or deprived of life\u2019s opportunities and who live in under-developed parts of the world. A surreal but true fact is that fundamentalism is born out of the womb of modernity. Anxiety, Uncertainty and Disillusionment This statement may appear contradictory because the modern individual is expected to respect diversity, be open-minded and balanced i n managing his or her life. However, the modern person can also, paradoxically embrace traits which are diametrically opposite and engendered in fundamenta lism, such as intolerance to diversity, close-mindedness and extremism in conduc t as well as thinking. A discussion on how modernity has paradoxically con tributed to fundamentalism, notwithstanding its role in giving birth to contemp orary civilisation, is necessary to understand the involvement of the privileged class in acts of terror. Modernity empowered humankind with the power of rea son, freedom in thinking and critical thought. The right to freedom and to think , even critically, brought about a phenomenal increase in diversity and pluralism that the world had never experienced before. In short, modernity driven by rationality ( through science and technology) and freedom (through secular democracy) generated mind- boggling changes due to the onslaught of differences and diversity. This is aggravated by the devaluation of the absolu te truth or big picture thinking in preference of a multiplicity of \u201ctruths\u201d based on e ach individual\u2019s perspective, in what has been popularly termed today as the \u201cpost-truth world\u201d. Such a world, also known as the perspectival world, will further increase di versity and intensify pluralism exponentially. The moderate response is to embrace change that div ersity brings about, while maintaining a judicious balance between what should be changed and what should be retained, such as principles and values. This balan ced approach will provide society with the moral ballast to ensure its well-being as it encounters increasing diversity brought about by modernity. Change and Certainty in an Uncertain World But the extreme way of responding to increasing div ersity is to keep on changing. This is happening. Nothing escapes change and there is n o notion of permanence. Everything will be relativised and principles and v alues that make society safe, secure and peaceful are discarded. Relativism does not give due regard to the concepti on of what is good and bad, thus weakening the anchors that provide stability to soc iety. This will eventually lead to moral nihilism \u2013 that nothing is intrinsically mora l or immoral. This will create a lot of imbalance, disequilibrium in society and hence unce rtainty. The uncertainty causes great anxiety. As a result, some modern and successful individuals will respond by going back to a notion of faith that provides certainty in a world that is otherwise uncertain. This is what fundamentalism is. It is a return to an extremely o ld interpretation of religion that is protected from the preserve of reason or scientific critique. Fundamentalism, as so defined, is intended to provi de a quick and easy way to overcome problems in society today due to uncertain ties in life. To do so, the fundamentalist will export the early or historical religious experiences embedded in sacred text and traditions to apply them to present times. Perceived War of Good Versus Evil A serious problem arises when fundamentalism is emb raced by individuals who have the propensity to commit acts of extremist violence or terror. They believe that their encounters with the problems of modern society toda y, due to moral nihilism and moral relativism, are an imagined war between the forces of good and evil. They view this as a repeat of the war between good and evil that happened in the religion\u2019s historical past. This comes as no surpri se as the early history of religion is many times marked with conflicts, wars and bloodshe d. According to Robert Bellah, a global sociologist of religion, founders of religions emerged in history when the ruling elites and ways of life in society were mired in immorality, conflict and violence. The religious in terpretations of the past, relevant to those early days but no longer valid today, provide the inspiration for fundamentalists who are prone to violence. They make believe that a situation of war exists today, and that they are thus justified to annihilate the evil s of modern society. They feel obligated to carry out this war because t hey believe that it is their \u201cdo or die\u201d mission to restore what they define to be a moral a nd good society. Religious fundamentalism is today the popular source to provi de perpetrators of violence with the impulses and motivations for acts of terrorism. Fundamentalists believe they have the monopoly of t ruthful interpretation of texts which render everybody else\u2019s interpretation as imp ure. Those with this puritanical attitude position themselves as the only saviours o f the society they live in. No other interpretation is valid and those who propagate con trary views can be killed even if they belong to the same faith as they are labelled as apostates. The war-like orientation of these fundamentalists, self-justified by sacred content selectively interpreted from within the religion, c auses them to go down the slippery slope of waging war against the enemies of God (pri marily from the West) who caused the uncertainty and immorality in society. Not All Fundamentalism Lead to Violence Nevertheless, there is a qualifier. Not all fundame ntalism lead to violence. There are fundamentalists who reject acts of violence. The discussion on the link between modernity, funda mentalism and violence is aptly summarised by global scholar on religion, Julius Li pner. Recognising that fundamentalism exists in modern society, he caution ed about the danger that it can lead to, when that society becomes perspectival and accords less importance to the use of universal reason. This is because the result ing trajectory is unpredictable and it often leads to violence. Already, we can see this happening in our world. An increasing number of individuals involved in terror attacks are modern, global and s uccessful, but disillusioned with the secular forces of modern society that give rise to evils and immoralities. Their perspectives shaped by religious fundamentalism mot ivate them to commit acts of violence or terror in their struggle to actualise a good and moral society. The nexus between modernity, fundamentalism and violence impl ies that global terrorism will continue to be a threat for a long time. ",

    "context": "COMMENTARY THE COVID-19 outbreak in Indonesia has been respond ed to with nonchalance by the central government, which emphasised that Indon esia has not encountered many cases of infection, if at all. The Indonesian healt h minister had also caused a stir with his public statement on the COVID-19 when he exhort ed the people to rely on \u2018prayer\u2019 as a preventive measure as he ticked off those who bought masks at a higher price. In reality, the COVID-19 outbreak has in fact had a devastating effect on Indonesia\u2019s economy, especially the travel and tourism sector. The Indonesian government reported that its tourism sector experienced losses of as much as US$500 million per month. The most direct impact of the outbreak is th e decline of inbound foreign tourists to Indonesia\u2019s most visited destinations, one of wh ich is Bintan Island, just about an hour by ferry to the south of Singapore. Bintan and Its Promising Tourism Sector Bintan is one of the islands in the Riau Archipelag o, which is currently being developed by the Indonesian government as a key tourist desti nation after Bali. Some of the better-known tourist destinations in Bintan are Tri kora Beach, Senggiling, and Beralas Pasir Island. Beside its pristine beaches, Bintan a lso has many other tourist destinations such as Lagoi Bay, Bukit Busung, the B lue Lake, Crystal Lagoon, Bukit Panglong, and Mount Bintan Waterfall. The island is the fourth largest contributor to tou rist numbers in Indonesia. In 2019, Bintan witnessed around 1.6 million of both domesti c and foreign tourists, of which 750,000 were foreign tourists. The number of foreig n tourists who visited Bintan exceeded the target of 700,000 set by the Ministry of Tourism. The tourism sector is the largest source of Bintan\u2019 s regional revenue, surpassing other sectors such as agriculture, mining, and mining res ources. Reliance on Mainland Chinese Tourists In 2019, Bintan\u2019s tourism sector was dominated by f oreign tourists from China. Of the 750,000 foreign tourists who visited Bintan, 35 per cent (around 260,000) were from China. Another 65 per cent comprised tourists from neighbouring countries like Singapore and Malaysia. One of the causes was the Chinese-dominated tourism business chain in Bintan set up by the Dalian Wanda Group, a major multinational conglomerate based in Beijing, with its core business in property development. The company is also known for investing in various other sectors such as construction, entertainment, manufacturing, and financial service s. Offering low-priced tour packages, the company engaged in a deal with the Ri au Islands Tourism Office in 2016. However, the excellent achievement of Bintan\u2019s tour ism sector has been undermined by the recent outbreak of COVID-19, following which the number of tourists from China per January 2020 dwindled to 500. This was due to t he prevention measures by both central and local governments halting direct flight s from China to Indonesia. Impact on the Locals The decline of tourists from mainland China due to the COVID-19 outbreak has affected businesses related to Bintan\u2019s tourism sec tor, such as hotels, gift shops, and local fishermen. The decreasing tourist numbers has led to declining demand for hotel rooms, gifts, and food consumption. According to the local labour union, this situation has threatened the jobs of locals who work in the industry even though the number of reso rts and hotels that have laid off their employees have gone largely unreported. Howev er, the impact of the outbreak on local businesses outside the tourism sector is n ot as bad given that the tourism industry in Bintan is dominated by the Dalian Wanda Group\u2019s chain of businesses. Under a controlled tour package, most of the mainla nd Chinese tourists are taken to places that are in business collaboration with Wand a Group. This raises other issues, namely, the disgruntlement of local businesses who do not benefit from tourism from China; they are unhappy with the monopoly enjoyed b y the Wanda Group as provided by the local government. What Next? To prevent a COVID-19 outbreak, the local governmen t in coordination with Jakarta has implemented measures such as banning direct fli ghts from China to the Riau Islands. Local authorities have also installed body heat temperature detectors in key gateways, including airports and seaports. The impacts of the coronavirus on the tourism secto r in Bintan also signalled the local government\u2019s failure to diversify the economy of Bi ntan to reduce dependency on tourism largely from or only on tourists from China . Relying heavily on tourists from China has hamstrung Bintan\u2019s tourism sector. The decrease in the number of mainland Chinese tour ists has also revealed the workings of the Wanda Group and its monopolistic pr actices. This implies the local government\u2019s failure to create a level playing fiel d for fair access to market and to find the right balance between foreign and local busines s interests. On a larger note, the local government should prior itise the need to devise local regulations ( Peraturan Daerah ) or regent\u2019s regulations ( Peraturan Bupati ) to curb monopolistic business operations in Bintan. The COVID-19 crisis may prove to be a blessing in d isguise for the tourism industry in Bintan if lessons are learned in terms of three are as: first, local government deregulation of the tourism sector; second, a searc h for new sources of tourists; and third, upgrading the skills of local tourism-relate d businesses to provide better services to tourists when the COVID-19 scare subsides and th e tourists return.

    "context": "Commentary DESPITE PROTESTS from China to the 2016 internation al arbitral ruling against its territorial claim, tensions in the South China Sea have been somewhat abating. But the South China Sea waters remain a flashpoint. In mid-October 2018, a near collision took place between the USS Decatur and the Chinese warship the Lanzou. The Decatur was conducting a Freedom of Navigation Operation (FONOP), asserting the right of free passage through international wat erways. The Lanzou was asserting Beijing's sovereignty claim over the South China Se a. In a speech at the Hudson Institute on 4 October 2018, US Vice President Mike Pence launched a ferocious attack against Beijing's foreign policy of \"authori tarian expansion\" and \"intimidation\". Assessing the Powers\u2019 Influence over SCS The overarching dominant actors influencing the sta te of peace and tensions in the South China Sea are China and the United States. Ja pan, a regional power, is emerging to be a player as well given Tokyo\u2019s conce rn for its economic lifeline being affected by tensions in the regional waters. What are the goals of these three players in the So uth China Sea? China\u2019s Game China's goal is to gain dominance of the South Chin a Sea. This would give it two advantages. One, control over the vast oil, gas, an d fisheries resources there. This would help to boost China's annual economic growth rate, which has slowed from 10% (after Deng Xiaoping's Open Door Policy 40 years ag o) to the current 6.5%. An estimated one-third of annual global shipping passe s through the South China Sea. Two, it would restrict other rival powers' access t o the South China Sea. Since 2005, Beijing has been unilaterally \"militarising the isl ands\" in the Sea: placing long-range warplanes and missiles. President Xi appears to see the South China Sea as a \"core interest\" of China, as in the cases of Taiwan, Xinj iang and Tibet. In June 2018, President Xi told visiting US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis that China would not \"withdraw even one inch from its ancestra l land\". In effect, Beijing has formulated an Asian \"Monroe Doctrine\". It is part o f President Xi Jinping's 2013 \"China Dream\", which called for the \"great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\". Xi\u2019s Muscle Flexing? Xi has repeatedly exhorted the military to be ready \u201cto fight and win wars under modern conditions\u201d. This is a reference to Beijing\u2019s memo ries of China's \"Century of Humiliation\" (1839-1949). Xi sees Washington as trying to contain China's ris e: the US has encircled China with its ring of alliances in Japan, South Korea, and th e Philippines. China is keen to have good relations with the United States. Speaking at the November 2018 Canton Trade Fair, President Xi said that China would open up mo re for imports. A similar statement was made by Vice President Wang Qisan during his vi sit to Singapore in early November 2018. In November 2018, China and the US resumed high-lev el talks, ahead of the East Asia Summit (EAS) in Singapore, which concluded last wee k. Xi and President Trump met at the G20 Summit in Argentina in early-December 20 18. While they huddled over their trade dispute, the South China Sea did not se em to have featured in their talks. Japan\u2019s Growing Interest Tokyo has no claim over the South China Sea. But Ja pan is deeply concerned about China's behaviour in the waters. In November 2014, Beijing had unilaterally declared an Area Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ) over the East China Sea. All of Japan's oil and gas imports pass through the South China Sea and the Malacca Strait. Chinese control of the South China Sea woul d threaten Japan's economic lifeline. This is clearly unacceptable to Tokyo. Th ere is a growing strategic rivalry between Japan and China. They have a maritime terri torial dispute over the Senkakus/Diaoyus in the East China Sea. Japan has sold Coast Guard patrol ships to Vietnam and the Philippines. In October 2018, Japan sent its destroyers and conducted subma rine drills in the South China Sea for the first time ever \u2212 to send a message to Beijing about its right of p as sage through international waterways. This is the same t hat Washington has been sending out to Beijing. But amid their growing economic interdependence, Ja pan and China are also keen to limit their rivalry. PM Shinzo Abe visited China in October 2018 to boost bilateral ties. It was the first such high-level visit in seven yea rs. US Getting Tougher? Washington is strongly opposed to Beijing's claim o ver the South China Sea. In 2017, President Trump called China a \"rival\", and a \"peer competitor\". The US would not tolerate Beijing seeking hegemony. Defence Secretar y Jim Mattis, speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore in June 2018, had demanded that Beijing stopped the militarisation of the South China Sea. He warned Beijing of unspecified \"severe consequenc es\". Admiral Philip S. Davidson (Chief, Pacific Command) told the US Congress in Oc tober 2018 that the US had lost control of the South China Sea, short of war with C hina. Implications: The Makings of a New Cold War? China has taken a tough but pragmatic approach to t he South China Sea disputes. There are no signs that Beijing would give up its c laim. The result is a new Cold War between the two largest economies in the world. At the just concluded 33rd ASEAN Summit in Singapor e, the South China Sea disputes were discussed. Prime Minister Lee Hsien L oong hoped that China-US relations would remain stable. ASEAN does not want to choose between the two superpowers. China and the US are the two biggest trading partne rs of the ASEAN states. But if Beijing and Washington escalate their conflict, ASE AN would not be able to escape the negative fallout: \"When two elephants fight, th e grass gets trampled\". At the just-ended APEC Summit that followed in Papu a New Guinea, China-US differences on trade and security were again on dis play. The APEC Summit ended without a formal leaders' statement due to China-US division over trade. But it is not just about trade. The US sees Beijing as trying to establish a Pax Sinica, to replace the existing Pax Americana. The result could be mor e than a new Cold War. ",
