      "COMMENTARY THE ASEAN special summit in Jakarta on 24 April 2021 has concluded with a five - point consensus on the Myanmar crisis.",
      "It called for cessation of violence, commencement of political dialogue, a constructive role for ASEAN including an opening for an ASEAN delegation, and the allowance of humanitarian assistance.",
      "At first glance, analysis of the Chair\u2019s statement showed signs of division \u2013 for instance, a lack of consensus on the release of poli tical prisoners, a necessary precondition for dialogue to begin.",
      "Activists criticised that the statement did not go far enough, appearing to show that the summit achieved little.",
      "Yet if politics is, to quote the German statesman Otto von Bismarck, about th e \u2018art of the possible\u2019, then it is necessary to set the outcome against a context of impossibilities, dead ends or worse, into which ASEAN did not throw itself.",
      "Difficulties with Intervention Disappointment with the summit may be seen in the context of calls for external intervention in Myanmar.",
      "This desire to remove the Tatmadaw should be tempered by the reality that this would be costly, risky, and no guarantee of a solution.",
      "Nevertheless, criticisms have continued about the failure to take a harder l ine against the junta, either through the UN or ASEAN, with neither path opening after the summit.",
      "The UN Security Council is deadlocked, where China and Russia would likely block moves by Western powers.",
      "While some therefore conclude that the UN system i s broken, one should think about the scenario where a liberal intervention proceeded without other states\u2019 consent: Myanmar could well become the first proxy battleground in a new front of an emerging \u201cCold War 2.0\u201d, with the conflict sharpening and poss ibly accelerating US -China confrontation.",
      "Mainland Southeast Asian states are not unreasonable to baulk at suggestions in this direction, given their experiences during the Cold War.",
      "At the regional level, ASEAN\u2019s options are tempered by the political div ersity of its membership and its own historical experiences.",
      "When Western powers intervened in post-colonial times, they never did so purely for the sake of democratic values, but always when there was a convergence of material interests to do so, with a b arely - concealed desire to secure those interests in -country for themselves.",
      "Iraq, Libya, Syria, and others provide a litany of examples of long, costly, and complex crises, with the West\u2019s own role itself intrinsically linked to the continuation of those c onflicts.",
      "In each case, domestic divisions interwove with foreign interests to amplify the conflicts.",
      "Roll back further in time and one finds the price of intervention was to have to accept brutal military leaders for whom loyalty to their patron was the primary factor for their grip on power.",
      "Post -colonial states in Southeast Asia rightfully reject this option.",
      "One thing ASEAN has done well is ensure that cultural and ideological diversity among its members did not lead to conflict.",
      "Breaking that formul a in order to \u201cfix\u201d Myanmar risks opening Pandora\u2019s Box for ASEAN member states, and this dismal conclusion unites them notwithstanding sometimes diametrically opposed political systems.",
      "Summit\u2019s High Points Within these constraints, therefore, ASEAN has little room for manoeuvre.",
      "Yet it managed to accomplish several key things at the summit.",
      "First, Tatmadaw Senior General Min Aung Hlaing attended, which was uncertain even days before the summit.",
      "He chose to talk to ASEAN and virtually no one else, prov iding a necessary opening from which a solution must be found.",
      "Under the gaze of ASEAN leaders, he could not decline ASEAN\u2019s offer, something which he would have de facto accomplished by simply failing to show up.",
      "Second, he met UN Special Envoy on Myanm ar Christine Schraner Burgener on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit.",
      "While what transpired has been kept under wraps, the mere fact of meeting would have been impossible without his arrival in Jakarta.",
      "Third, on ASEAN\u2019s part, it presented one of the most public and interventionist outcome statements the regional grouping has ever delivered to another member state.",
      "This represented a big step beyond ASEAN\u2019s usual practices and demonstrated their view of its potential impact on regional security and the impo rtance they have placed on resolution to the crisis.",
      "Next Steps While critics lambasted the lack of details, this is overstated.",
      "There are few details because ASEAN is in uncharted waters, never having done such action before \u2013 itself a sign of how far ASEAN went to secure this outcome.",
      "ASEAN does not commit to things it does not believe it can do.",
      "Implementation details will be hammered out in ASEAN capitals and the ASEAN Secretariat soon.",
      "However, this is just the start of a long process.",

      "COMMENTARY AT THE historic Bretton Woods Conf erence of 1944, to address the economic instability of the 1930s, a set of rules -based international economic institutions (IEIs) that are collectively referred to as the global economic architecture (GEA) was established under the leadership of the United States.",
      "This architecture comprised the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for macroeconomic and monetary stability; the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \u2013 the predecessor of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to promote trade openness; and the World Bank to provide development finance for poverty reduction.",
      "Although it had several critical flaws, the Bretton Woods GEA worked well for more than 60 years arguably until the eruption of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC).",
      "It ushered in the golden age of globalisation and brought about economic growth and prosperity all over the world.",
      "Gradualist Reform & the Changed Context Reforms of this architecture have been implemented in an incremental and gradual manner.",
      "These comprise (i) the establishment of the G7 in 1975 and its upgradation to the G20 summit in the aftermath of the GFC; (ii) a shift to a floating system of exchange rates in 1973 after the collapse of the pegged rates of the Bretton Woods monetary arrangement; (iii) the establishment of the Financial Stability Forum and its upgrading to the Financial Stability Board after the GFC; and (iv) the transitioning from GATT to the WTO in 1995.",
      "More recently, the context in which the global IEIs operate has changed in two important ways.",
      "First, the unipolar world with the US as the sole superpower has become multi -polar where economic and political power has shifted to some extent to the dynamic emerging markets, particularly those in Asia such as China and India.",
      "These emerging markets have sought a greater voice in the operation of the IEIs.",
      "But the major Western shareholders remain antipathetic to the required changes in rules and policies.",
      "Second, during the Bretton Woods era, policymakers were wary of uncontrolled finance and had imposed restri ctions on cross -border flows of capital.",
      "In the 1990s, under the so -called Washington Consensus, countries around the world deregulated their capital accounts.",
      "Over time, this has produced highly integrated global financial markets and capital flows that h ave dwarfed the regulatory capacity and operations of IEIs.",
      "With financial globalisation, a new type of crisis associated with large capital inflows and their sudden reversals have become more frequent occurring every 10 to 12 years.",
      "In addition to insta bility, financial globalisation has also led to intra - and inter - country income inequality.",
      "Calls for Big Bang Reforms: Bretton Woods 2.0? Calls have, therefore, been made for a comprehensive reform of the Bretton Woods GEA.",
      "In the post -GFC period, a num ber of academics and politicians had called for a New Bretton Woods (NBW), a wider and more comprehensive reform of the GEA.",
      "These had included Professor Joseph Stiglitz and politicians like Nicholas Sarkozy and Gordon Brown.",
      "The then central bank govern or of China, Zhou Xiaochuan, had also made a pitch for a new international reserve asset to replace the US dollar and its hegemony.",
      "The calls for a NBW fizzled out at the interregnum stage because the recovery from the GFC turned out to be faster than ex pected and the world experienced a Great Recession rather than the originally expected repeat of the Great Depression of the 1930s.",
      "This led to complacency and dilution of reform proposals.",
      "Similar calls for comprehensive reforms of the Bretton Wood GEA h ave been made in the wake of the COVID -19 pandemic which has led to the worst global economic downturn since the Great Depression.",
      "According to the latest IMF estimate, world output shrank by 3.1% in 2020 as compared to 0.1% in 2009.",
      "Gallaghar and Kozul -Wright have noted that inequality, indebtedness, and insufficient productive investments have become the new normal and called for a renewed multilateral order.",
      "Tinkering with existing rules cannot provide the way out.",
      "Vines argues that the world now faces two choices (i) revisit the direction of t he mid - 1940s when ruled based GEA were established or (ii) return to the path of the 1930s when weak cooperation led to an economic depression and eventually a world war.",
      "He adds that the crises of this century proves that there is an urgent need for funda mental reform by learning lessons from history.",
      "What lessons can be learned from COVID -19 and the invasion of Ukraine? Will they be game -changing events and lead to the overhaul of the global economic architecture? If so, how? Going Forward Looking for ward, will the calls for Big Bang reform of the Bretton Woods GEA be realised any time soon? Probably, not.",
      "This is because with the recent rise in nationalism and populism worldwide and the on -going conflict between the US and China and the Russia -Ukraine War, the political will to spur global cooperation and coordination is weak and risk of yet another East -West divide reminiscent of the Cold War era world order is genuine.",
      "Under former President Trump, the US had embraced the \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy and protectionism pivoting away from multilateralism of the past to \u201cunilateralism\u201d and \u201cbilateralism\u201d.",
      "President Biden is supportive of multilateralism but still many of the tariffs that were imposed on about 20% of total imports of the US remain.",
      "Similarl y, European countries had initiated policy actions to protect their economies especially from rising inflows of migrant workers from the Middle East.",
      "Countries around the world also retaliated and became more inward -looking.",
      "Although it remains an export p owerhouse, China has also stressed the importance of domestic market when it rolled out the \u201cdual circulation\u201d policy paradigm.",
      "Since 2020, India has also adopted a more self -reliant policy.",

      "COMMENTARY AT THE historic Bretton Woods Conf erence of 1944, to address the economic instability of the 1930s, a set of rules -based international economic institutions (IEIs) that are collectively referred to as the global economic architecture (GEA) was established under the leadership of the United States.",
      "This architecture comprised the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for macroeconomic and monetary stability; the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \u2013 the predecessor of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to promote trade openness; and the World Bank to provide development finance for poverty reduction.",
      "Although it had several critical flaws, the Bretton Woods GEA worked well for more than 60 years arguably until the eruption of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC).",
      "It ushered in the golden age of globalisation and brought about economic growth and prosperity all over the world.",
      "Gradualist Reform & the Changed Context Reforms of this architecture have been implemented in an incremental and gradual manner.",
      "These comprise (i) the establishment of the G7 in 1975 and its upgradation to the G20 summit in the aftermath of the GFC; (ii) a shift to a floating system of exchange rates in 1973 after the collapse of the pegged rates of the Bretton Woods monetary arrangement; (iii) the establishment of the Financial Stability Forum and its upgrading to the Financial Stability Board after the GFC; and (iv) the transitioning from GATT to the WTO in 1995.",
      "More recently, the context in which the global IEIs operate has changed in two important ways.",
      "First, the unipolar world with the US as the sole superpower has become multi -polar where economic and political power has shifted to some extent to the dynamic emerging markets, particularly those in Asia such as China and India.",
      "These emerging markets have sought a greater voice in the operation of the IEIs.",
      "But the major Western shareholders remain antipathetic to the required changes in rules and policies.",
      "Second, during the Bretton Woods era, policymakers were wary of uncontrolled finance and had imposed restri ctions on cross -border flows of capital.",
      "In the 1990s, under the so -called Washington Consensus, countries around the world deregulated their capital accounts.",
      "Over time, this has produced highly integrated global financial markets and capital flows that h ave dwarfed the regulatory capacity and operations of IEIs.",
      "With financial globalisation, a new type of crisis associated with large capital inflows and their sudden reversals have become more frequent occurring every 10 to 12 years.",
      "In addition to insta bility, financial globalisation has also led to intra - and inter - country income inequality.",
      "Calls for Big Bang Reforms: Bretton Woods 2.0? Calls have, therefore, been made for a comprehensive reform of the Bretton Woods GEA.",
      "In the post -GFC period, a num ber of academics and politicians had called for a New Bretton Woods (NBW), a wider and more comprehensive reform of the GEA.",
      "These had included Professor Joseph Stiglitz and politicians like Nicholas Sarkozy and Gordon Brown.",
      "The then central bank govern or of China, Zhou Xiaochuan, had also made a pitch for a new international reserve asset to replace the US dollar and its hegemony.",
      "The calls for a NBW fizzled out at the interregnum stage because the recovery from the GFC turned out to be faster than ex pected and the world experienced a Great Recession rather than the originally expected repeat of the Great Depression of the 1930s.",
      "This led to complacency and dilution of reform proposals.",
      "Similar calls for comprehensive reforms of the Bretton Wood GEA h ave been made in the wake of the COVID -19 pandemic which has led to the worst global economic downturn since the Great Depression.",
      "According to the latest IMF estimate, world output shrank by 3.1% in 2020 as compared to 0.1% in 2009.",

      "COMMENTARY THE TRUCE between the United States and China has f inally ended, as the trade talks collapsed in Washington DC last month.",
      "As of 10 May 2019 at 12:01 am, US increased tariff rates from 10% to 25% on US$200 bi llion worth of Chinese goods that included 5,745 items.",
      "After three days, China immed iately responded by declaring that they would impose tariffs of up to 25% on 5,140 Ame rican products amounting to $60 billion.",
      "On the same day, the United States Trade Representa tives (USTR) drafted a list of 3,805 Chinese products valued at approximately $300 billion dollars that could be subject to potential tariffs up to 25%.",
      "On 30 May, it was reported that China put on hold the purchase of American soybeans that come fr om the Midwest farm belt, the core constituencies of the US president Donald Trum p.",
      "And before leaving for the D- Day Ceremony in Normandy recently, US President Don ald Trump made another fresh threat that he could go for tariffs on anothe r $300 billion of Chinese goods at the right time, which means he might slap tariffs on vi rtually every Chinese export.",
      "Tit-for-Tat Tit-for-tat tariff strategies by the two great powe rs are one of the worst outcomes from the breakdown of the talks, but they are not that s urprising, since the US and China had already gone through similar phases last year.",
      "What was not fully expected this time is that the s tandoff between the US and China that started as skirmishes over tariff issues is no w taking a completely new turn, as the two countries are plunging into conflicts over almost everything, including technology, diplomatic, and geopolitical issues wit h no signs of ending.",
      "Even when the two sides announced retaliatory tarif fs against each other in May, there seemed to be a silver lining for a negotiated settl ement, since the two countries were evidently seeking concessions, delaying the effects of retaliatory tariffs until imports from one country reach the port of another on 1 Jun e.",
      "Then why did the US-China trade talk fail all of sudden? Differing Expectations Many sources say that the two parties had quite dif ferent expectations about implementation of the draft agreement, which was co mplicated by the dynamics of domestic politics in each side.",
      "Last March, China p assed a new Foreign Investment law at the National People\u2019s Congress in efforts to attract foreign investors, while the trade conflict with the US has sparked its economic downturn.",
      "Chinese officials were quite reluctant to make any further legal changes to improve the outcome of the trade talks, as they believe tha t the newly drafted investment law provides foreign firms with fair treatment and prot ection from illegal interference from the Chinese government.",
      "The Trump administration and American firms did not agree.",
      "Like the European Union and many other critics, they see that China\u2019s new i nvestment law does not really go very far, as it remains vague and broad on the issu es of forced technology transfers, intellectual property rights, and know-how disclosu re.",
      "China wanted to carry out the agreement by administ rative actions without legal commitments.",

      "Before carrying out the cold-blooded shootings, Abu Uqayl addressed the camera in English, urging ISIS supporters to kill all \u201cunbelievers\u201d and \u201capostates\u201d from East Asia to the west of Afric a.",
      "Some Broad Observations The video clip has garnered much attention on socia l media, prompting the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) to condemn th e clip, asserting that it represented a \u201cdesperate attack\u201d by ISIS to drive a wedge between Muslims and non- Muslims.",
      "A few broad observations about this latest clip appear pertinent: First , with Abu Uqayl\u2019s videotaped killing of an unarmed prisoner, a certain psychological and symbolic barrier has been crossed.",
      "He had killed a man in cold blood for what he believed to be a righteous religi ous cause and recorded it for all to see.",
      "His criminal act along with many other such at rocities by ISIS in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere, underscores the susceptibility of some i ndividuals to violent religious fanaticism.",
      "The danger of such acts is that they could inspire impressionable and disaffected individuals to carry out copy-cat attacks.",
      "As MUIS warned, such \u201cvideos prey on the minds of the weak, or those who do not have proper religious guidance\u201d.",
      "In September 2014, the Australian police thwarted plans by young supporters of ISIS in Sydney to carry out videotaped beheadings \u2013 \u201cdemonstration ki llings\u201d -- of random members of the public, similar to what ISIS was doing at the s ame time in Iraq and Syria with captured enemies.",
      "Second , the tactical bar for staging violent attacks has been lowered as well.",
      "ISIS propaganda for some time now has called for what ha s been termed the \u201cweaponisation of everyday life\u201d.",
      "In other words, i nstead of getting hold of firearms or learning how to make improvised explosives from the Internet, all that is needed to wreak havoc in densely populated cities like New Yo rk, Barcelona, London and for that matter Singapore, are everyday items like cars , trucks and knives.",
      "It is worth noting in this regard that in the same clip featuring Uqayl, another Malaysian militant identified as Muhammad Aqif Heusen Rahizat , assured supporters that if they cannot make it to Syria to join ISIS Central, they could do so in their respective countries.",
      "The clarion call to would-be lone wolves could not be clearer: carry out attacks wherever you are.",
      "East Asia Still A Target Third , Abu Uqayl\u2019s injunction to kill \u201cunbelievers\u201d and \u201capostates\u201d from East Asia to Africa are most telling.",
      "It affirms that despite th e defeat of ISIS-backed militant groups seeking to carve out a territorial base in Marawi C ity in Mindanao last October, ISIS Central still identifies \u201cEast Asia\u201d as an area whe re they want to establish a wilayat or regional province.",
      "Furthermore, Uqayl\u2019s violent exhortation suggests h is deep indoctrination in the virulent, skewed ISIS interpretation of Islamic tex ts to justify extreme violence.",
      "This is a complex issue, but suffice to say that ISIS basic ally emphasises the so-called \u201csword verses\u201d of the Quran, totally ignoring other passag es and traditions that counterbalance the former and provide a more textur ed and nuanced understanding of the faith.",
      "Finally , Uqayl and ISIS\u2019 use of terms such as \u201c kuffar \u201d (or \u201c kafir \u201d - unbeliever) and \u201cmurtadin \u201d (apostate) in the context of extremist propaganda speaks to the dehumanising effects of indoctrination in violent e xtremist ideology.",
      "Social psychological literature is replete with warnings t hat linguistic dehumanisation is a slippery slope that, in conjunction with political, social, economic and ideological factors, can pave the way towards out-group violenc e.",
      "The dehumanising of out-groups \u2013 before extremist i deology even enters the picture - can occur imperceptibly through the spread of exces sively puritanical interpretations of a religion.",
      "Overly puritanical interpretations of Islam - or an y other faith for that matter - that entrenches a dehumanising mindset towards other gro ups, may well \u201csoften up\u201d impressionable individuals to the violent extremist ideologies of the likes of ISIS and produce more Abu Uqayls.",
      "Implications In sum, the latest video clip suggests two major im plications as we begin the new year.",
      "First, continued public vigilance, as the ongoing S G Secure campaign seeks to promote, remains important in view of the threat of lone wolf attacks.",
      "Second, countering the content and dissemination of ISIS extremist ideology should continue apace, accompanied by parallel efforts by religious leaders to strengthen wider interpretations of the faith that eschew star k, us-versus-them categorical thinking.",
      "These include emphasising respect for not just co-religionists but all humanity, as equally enjoined by the faith.",
      "As MUIS rightly observed, Islam contains within its rich heritage intellectual resources that amply recognise \u201cthe sanctity of human life\u201d.",
      "Rediscovering and reasserting this aspect of the faith\u2019s proud heritage \u2013 through, for instance, deeper theological excavation of the longstanding, tolerant traditions espoused within Islam, and widely practised in the Southeast Asian region -- seems an increasingly pertinent task."

      "COMMENTARY ON 2 JUNE 2021, President Xi Jinping told senior Communist Party officials to expand China\u2019s circle of friends and stressed the importance of improving propaganda efforts.",
      "Beijing seems to have finally realised that its image and credibility in the region and beyond have reached rock bottom.",
      "Numerous books and articles in the past had touched on Chinese soft power and growing sophistication of its diplomacy; from Africa to Europe to Latin America, China\u2019s prestige and influence was expanding.",
      "However, in recent years, publications on Chinese soft power have virtually declined.",
      "While the People\u2019s Republic of China has always had its share of critics, many Western media outlets were and remain biased towards it.",
      "The key factor behind the decline in China\u2019s soft power is to be found partly in Be ijing.",
      "Alarming Neighbours China\u2019s image in the Southeast Asian region \u2500 its immediate neighbourhood \u2500 has weakened in recent years.",
      "China has territorial disputes with four of the 10 ASEAN countries, Brunei, Malaysia, Philippines and Vietnam while tens ions with Indonesia, a non-claimant, have also risen due to overlapping economic zones.",
      "The Chinese navy and coast guard have engaged in numerous confrontations with the Southeast Asian claimants and built several artificial islands to assert Beijing\u2019s claims.",
      "Beijing\u2019s strong -arm tactics have led to ASEAN countries closing ranks with a common position on the South China Sea.",
      "China\u2019s relations with Japan and India have reached their lowest point in decades.",
      "In Europe public opinion on China has also wor sened.",
      "While a BBC poll in 2010 concluded that China was on balance seen positively by 15 countries, Beijing is now viewed more with suspicion.",
      "In a 2020 survey covering 13 European nations conducted by a group of 14 research entities that included Chatham House and the Central European Institute for Asian Studies (CEIAS), China\u2019s approval rating was at an historic low.",
      "Overall, views of China are predominantly negative.",
      "Factors contributing to this shift included China\u2019s confrontational diplomacy and the human rights situation.",
      "On the other hand, Russia has the most positive view of China.",
      "While Germany and several other EU members have imposed tariffs on various Chinese products and demanded that China open its markets, trade with China is perceived pre dominantly positively in most countries surveyed, except France, the UK and Sweden.",
      "Beijing, on its part, hoped that massive trade between China and the West would make it more receptive towards Beijing and Chinese policies.",
      "However, as the case of Austr alia shows, the US$257 billion in two -way trade for the period 2019 -2020 accounting for 29 percent of Australia\u2019s foreign trade has not stopped the two nations from plunging into a trade war.",
      "The COVID -19 pandemic and controversial allegations that China w as not honest in disclosing the virus\u2019 origin was probably one of the worst disasters for Chinese soft power since the Mao era.",
      "Eroding Soft Power There is little argument that China\u2019s image is not in a good shape in many parts of the world.",
      "Can Beijing reverse this? While this will be hard, it is, however, not impossible.",
      "China\u2019s image took on a positive trajectory after it reformed from a Maoist state spreading revolution to joining the mainstream global economy and eventually becoming a darling dest ination for foreign investors due to its huge markets.",
      "While times are much different now, Beijing can still regain its claim of pursuing a peaceful rise.",
      "In 2002 China and ASEAN signed the Declaration of Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC).",
      "After some years, China and the ASEAN countries agreed to upgrade the DOC to a Code of Conduct (COC), which is due to be signed in 2021.",
      "If China was to reduce its expansionist activities in the South China Sea, this could lead to a substantial easing of tensions between China and ASEAN.",
      "This in turn will have a positive knock -on effect on relations with other powers with interests in the region such as the US, Japan and Australia.",
      "Greater transparency on the part of Chinese companies and the opening o f more sectors of the Chinese economy to EU investees could go a long way at reducing tensions.",
      "As a German diplomat told the author: \u201cThe Chinese complain when we restrict Huawei in Europe.",
      "However, in China all telecommunications are run by the state.\u201d While the COVID -19 pandemic has somewhat dented China\u2019s image, its massive donations of vaccines, ventilators and protective gear have improved it in some parts of the world.",
      "Will a powerful China be willing to find a negotiated solution? Will it open more sectors of its economy to foreign investment? While only time will tell, one thing is certain: It will be easier for China to prosper with friends around it not enemies."

      "Hawkish and Dovish Options for Dealing with China The Obama, Trump and Biden administrations have responded to China\u2019s expansionist activities by adopting an increasingly hardline policy towards Beijing.",
      "Most notably, they have boosted US military deployments to the region, established new multilateral secur ity partnerships, such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (or QUAD) and AUKUS , and restricted high -technology exports to the PRC.",
      "Several foreign policy commentators have either endorsed this policy shift or lamented that it is not tough enough.",
      "The cornerst one of an even more hawkish US policy would be significantly expanded military deployments and commitments throughout the region, including the extension of a formal security guarantee to Taiwan.",
      "By contrast, some analysts have argued that a less confront ational policy towards China is preferable to avert war and address transnational threats such as climate change.",
      "The centrepiece of a more dovish policy would be the cession to China of a sphere of influence (i.e., military preponderance) over Taiwan and the South and East China Seas.",
      "Washington\u2019s Credibility Problem Unfortunately, a serious credibility problem afflicts both the hawkish and dovish approaches, which undermines their likely effectiveness.",
      "The hawkish option lacks credibility because the o utcome of China\u2019s territorial disputes matters far more to China than to the United States.",
      "For the PRC, those disputes are transpiring in adjacent geographical areas that constitute vital strategic and economic interests, and significantly impact its nati onal sovereignty.",
      "On the other hand, the United States is an ocean away, and many Americans may not view Taiwan and the South and East China Seas as vital interests.",
      "This disparity is critical because scholarly research has shown that the outcomes of crises and wars often favour the side that has more at stake in the confrontation, not the side that is more powerful.",
      "In the last half century, the US superpower has itself lost large -scale wars against far weaker but more determined adversaries in Vietnam and Afghanistan.",
      "Since Taiwan and the South and East China Seas are ultimately less important to the United States than to China, doves argue that it would be geopolitically prudent for America to cede them to China\u2019s sphere of influence.",
      "Notwithstanding the rhetorical scorn which generations of US policymakers have heaped on the concept, spheres of influence have long served as a critical tool for promoting peace between great power adversaries.",
      "Unfortunately, this option also entails a serious credibility problem for the United States.",
      "This is because granting China a sphere of influence would inevitably spark widespread alarm ab out the reliability of US commitments to the defence of its regional allies.",
      "This strategic concern would be particularly intense for two reasons.",
      "First, among the states that are contesting China\u2019s maritime claims are Japan and the Philippines, which als o happen to be lynchpins of the US alliance network in the region.",
      "Consequently, if the United States permits China to seize the contested territories, this will signal that Washington is also unwilling to oppose Chinese aggression against the Japanese and Philippine home islands.",
      "Second, although the United States is no longer formally allied to Taiwan, the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act commits Washington to provide the island with de fence assistance and to \u201cmaintain the capacity\u2026to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion [against Taiwan].\u201d Also, three of the last four presidents \u2013 Bush, Trump and Biden \u2013 have either declared or strongly insinuated that they would come to Taiwan\u2019s defence if it were to be attacked by the PRC.",
      "Given the intense bipartisan anti-China mood in US politics today, it is almost inconceivable that the Biden administration would abandon Taiwan \u2013 an economically thriving liberal democracy \u2013 to the depredations of the PRC.",
      "Averting the Worst -Case Scenarios The United States can mitigate the credibility problems associated with both the hawkish and dovish strat egies by navigating a middle course between them.",
      "Such a policy would seek to raise the costs of further Chinese expansionism in the South and East China Seas and Taiwan Strait through \u201c soft balancing \u201d, or the coordinated employment of non -military tools of coercive statecraft, including diplomatic ostracism and economic sanctions.",
      "This middle -ground policy would also enable Washington to continue providing Taiw an with robust military assistance.",
      "In recognition of the unfavourable balance of stakes for China, however, the United States would have to scrupulously refrain from direct military intervention against China in these geographic areas.",
      "Importantly, this prohibition means that the United States would not employ its military forces to defend the maritime claims of Japan and the Philippines.",
      "But it could reassure Tokyo and Manila of Washington\u2019s ironclad commitment to the security of their uncontested homela nds, however, by significantly bolstering its military presence in both countries.",
      "Although this approach would not appeal to diehard hawks or d oves, it might avoid the worst -case scenarios associated with their preferred policies.",
      "For hawks, it is that Washington stumbles into yet another exorbitant and inauspicious war of choice on the heels of Iraq and Afghanistan, though this time against a nu clear armed great power.",

      "As an author and researcher, I met Raisi a few years ago in Mashhad, a city of religious pilgrimage in northeast Iran.",
      "I found him to be hardline ideologically and distrustful of the US and its regional allies, but meanwhile very philosophical and engaging in discussing Iran\u2019s problems.",
      "Like Khamenei, he was sceptical of the US fully implementing the nuclear agreement.",
      "But he could also see th e need for ending the US sanctions and improving the living conditions of the Iranian people.",
      "He impressed me that, in tandem with Khamenei and many other conservative colleagues, including some in the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), he could be ijtihadi when the circumstances demanded.",
      "Hence his declaration of support as president -elect for the current Vienna negotiations to reach an agreement with the US over the JCPOA and for improving relations with regional Arab countries.",
      "Pragmatic Hardliner or Conservative Pragmatist? Raisi is unlikely to engage in any structural reforms that could rock the conservatives\u2019 hold on power or to show flexibility on Iranian national and regional security postures.",
      "But as Supreme Le ader, he is as much interested in the survival of the regime and therefore prone to pragmatic actions.",
      "A fundamental problem of the regime has been its bifurcation between the \u2018sovereignty of God\u2019, embodied in the Supreme Leader, and the \u2018sovereignty of people\u2019, reflected by the elected president.",
      "This has caused power struggles and policy confusion when someone from the ijtihadi side has been elected to the presidency, as in the case of Mohammad Khatami (1997 -2005) and the outgoing Hassan Rouhani.",
      "Raisi\u2019s election places just about all the top institutions of power under the conservatives\u2019 control, enabling them to focus on addressing domestic and foreign policy challenges without resistance from their reformist opponents.",
      "This does not provide a long -term solution to the Islamic Republic\u2019s ills but narrows the gap between the two lines of authorities for the time being."

      "The Navy has thus made its presence seen and felt for all sides.",
      "Whether these examples have provided a precedence for the future US Navy miss ions and involvement in disputes remains to be seen.",
      "Legitimacy and Credibility It goes without saying that while stronger US support for weaker states\u2019 maritime rights is welcomed, it also raises tension in the region.",
      "With the stronger, more muscular US Navy presence comes more frequent encounters with Chinese counterparts and, therefore, grown risk of accidents and escalation.",
