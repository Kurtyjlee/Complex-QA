    "context": "COMMENTARY IN 2015, C hina and Pakistan forged strategic links with the signing of the China - Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) agreement.. This major tie -up provides Beijing with vital access to the Arabian Sea, while adding an extension to China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).. Pakistan, on its part, benefits economically from the CPEC as it connects to about 58 projects worth about US$62 billion: eight projects to develop Pakistan\u2019s Gwadar port, city and airport in Baluchistan, 21 coal, hydro and solar power plants, power transmission lines, highways, railways and a fibre optic cable project.. China saw an economically prosperous and stable Pakistan as politically advantageous and wanted to create a geostrategic connectivity corridor from its resource -rich Muslim Xinjiang provi nce to Pakistan\u2019s Gwadar city and port.. CPEC 2.. 0 Gwadar is strategically important because of its closeness to the Strait of Hormuz, the junction of vital international sea shipping routes.. For China, the construction and administration of coal -fired po wer plants within CPEC were good alternative business opportunities for its state -owned enterprises abroad at a time when coal -fired power in China plant projects are being scaled down because of President Xi Jinping\u2019s stronger focus on sustainable power s upply.. The previous Nawaz Sharif government and the present Imran Khan -led administration hoped that projects with Chinese technological know -how and money would help upgrade Pakistan\u2019s industrial infrastructure and revitalise its economic development.. P akistan\u2019s perennial power shortages and power transmission losses have been major challenges for every Pakistani government.. CPEC power plants were to provide a fast remedy.. At Pakistan\u2019s request China\u2019s investments were predominantly in coal power plant s.. A tax -free Gwadar deep sea port was expected to turn it into a trade and transport hub.. Before his election in 2018, Prime Minister Khan pledged to renegotiate CPEC projects.. However, the majority of projects was continued.. PM Khan recently pledged \u201cto complete CPEC at any cost\u201d when he launched the second phase of the megaproject dubbed CPEC 2.. 0 in mid -2020.. He also increased the military\u2019s role in the CPEC governance when he appointed retired army general Asim Bajwa as chairman of the newly created CP EC Authority.. Bajwa was tasked to push ahead with stalled CPEC projects.. Even though Pakistan managed the COVID -19 pandemic comparatively well, its economy suffered.. Work on CPEC has resumed since June 2020.. In spite of Pakistan\u2019s problematic fiscal situ ation, new contracts were recently signed for two hydropower and the Mainline1 railway projects worth $11 billion.. In July, a controversial CPEC Authority Bill was introduced, granting the military comprehensive powers and reducing the role of civilian g overnment.. In spite of recent corruption allegations against Gen.. Bajwa, PM Khan retained him as CPEC chairman.. Progress and Problems Information on the progress of CPEC projects is opaque.. Some projects have been subdivided into different stages, some s helved or are still without financial closure.. PM Khan claims \u201csubstantial progress\u201d.. Observers guess that a quarter of the projects have been completed, among them nine power projects (worth $7.. 9 billion).. Nine projects (worth $9.. 5 billion) are being co nstructed (four coal power, four renewable energy plants and a coal mine).. The Gwadar projects are advancing, the Lahore Metro line and part of the Peshawar -Karachi Motorway have been completed.. Pakistan faces a vicious cycle of high debt liabilities.. It s total debt and liabilities surged to 106% of GDP in 2020 since PM Khan took office.. Domestic debt has risen by 35% to about $135 billion.. Its foreign reserves have been falling to a low of $13 billion.. Its GDP contracted by 2.. 8 per cent in 2019/20.. In 2019 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a $6 billion loan but demanded \u201cdecisive fiscal consolidation to reduce public debt\u201d.. In March 2020, PM Khan asked China for a moratorium on its loans to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic.. China announced on 7 June 2020, a suspension of debt repayment for 77 developing countries, including Pakistan, under the G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative until December 2020.. Pakistan also borrowed $1 billion in 2020 from China to refinance a $6.. 2 bil lion loan it had secured from Saudi Arabia in 2018.. \\ Pakistan received $4.. 2 billion from the IMF, ADB, World Bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to tie it over the COVID -19 situation.. It is estimated that Pakistan owes China between $22 and $30 billion, constituting the largest portion of its external debt it owes to one country.. A dangerous debt spiral is looming.. Shifting from Oil to Coal The Sharif government\u2019s decision to switch from oil to coal was problematic.. Some 70% of all the CPEC pow er plant projects are coal -based.. Coal usage is projected to rise from five million tonnes in 2015 to 15 million in 2020, and imports will also rise.. Pakistan\u2019s commitment to reduce greenhouse gases under the Paris Agreement will be difficult to achieve.. T his coal focus contrasts with China\u2019s newly proclaimed sustainability policy at home.. China continues to be involved in coal power plants in its neighbourhood.. Most CPEC power plants are based on the Chinese BOOT \u201cbuild, own, operate, transfer\u201d model.. Ch inese ownership will be transferred to the Government of Pakistan after 30 years of operation.. This raises transparency and accountability questions.. Following recent electricity price hikes, a government committee, set up in August 2019, reviewed the role of Independent Power Producers (IPP).. It recently found serious \u201cmalpractices\u201d by IPPs like inflated operating costs and high annual profits.. Pressure is mounting on Pakistan\u2019s PM Khan by the newly founded opposition \u201cPakistan Democratic Movement\u201d to en sure efficacy of CPEC projects.. For years, Baluchistan separatists and insurgents have been fighting the government.. CPEC projects have become targets and are increasingly unpopular among the Baluchistan population.. The Pakistani Army launched major secu rity operations but seems to have been rather heavy -handed in its approach.. Alleged extrajudicial arrests by the military have resulted in a loss of confidence in the government.. Five years after the start of CPEC, Pakistanis demand greater transparency and accountability.. It is in the mutual interests of both governments to ensure that tangible benefits reach the Pakistani population soon and that greater transparency is achieved.. Pakistan\u2019s fiscal and economic woes, compounded by the effects of the pand emic, do not leave much room for manoeuvre.",

    "context": "Commentary THE ECONOMIC and strategic significance of the Bay of Bengal is growing rapidly with the re-emergence of the idea of the \u2018Indo-Paci fic\u2019 region.. This notion assumes that the growing economic, geopolitical and securit y connections between the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean regions are creating a shared strategic space.. The Bay is evolving as the centre of the Indo-Pacif ic region again.. The renewed focus has given a new lease of life to the developmental efforts in the region, in particular the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multisectoral Tech nical and Economic Cooperation or BIMSTEC.. Outlining Changes To revive the region as a distinct community and to promote regional cooperation among the Bay of Bengal\u2019s littoral states, BIMSTEC was established on 6 June 1997 as a regional organisation comprising seven states (five from South Asia: Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka; and two from So utheast Asia: Myanmar and Thailand).. As the BIMSTEC process enters the third decade of i ts existence, it has yet to make visible progress in advancing concrete cooperation among the member states.. In the last two years, however, member states have investe d some fresh energy to make BIMSTEC a valuable institution for regional integra tion and collaboration.. BIMSTEC has a huge potential as a natural platform for development cooperation in a rapidly changing Indo-Pacific region, and the Bay of Bengal region can leverage its unique position as a bridge linking South and South east Asia.. BIMSTEC had been mostly overlooked until a renewed push came from India in October 2016, when it hosted an outreach summit wit h leaders of BIMSTEC countries alongside the BRICS summit in Goa.. Since then, ther e have been some progress, in BIMSTEC cooperation in several areas including secu rity, counter-terrorism, transport connectivity and tourism, among others.. Some timely developments, for example, the BIMSTEC National Security Chiefs meeting, disaster management exercise, launching of a hospital and Tele-medicine network, founding of a centre for weather and clima te, meetings of business chambers and industry associations, helped maintain the mome ntum.. Ministerial and senior officials\u2019 meetings motivated member countries for strengthening cooperation in key sectors.. Building Bay of Bengal Region Reflecting the growing geopolitical and geoeconomic significance of the Bay of Bengal region, the 4th BIMSTEC Summit was held in Kathmand u on 30-31 August and has generated optimism in the region.. The growing value of BIMSTEC and its attempt to generate synergy through collective efforts by memb er states, can be understood, for three key reasons.. First, there is a greater appreciation of BIMSTEC\u2019s potential due to the geographical contiguity, abundant natural and human resources, r ich historical linkages and cultural heritage for promoting deeper cooperation in the re gion.. Indeed, with a changed narrative and approach the Bay of Bengal has potent ial to become the epicentre of the Indo-Pacific idea \u2013 a place where the strategic interests of the major powers of East and South Asia intersect.. Political support and strong commitment from all me mber countries is crucial for making BIMSTEC a dynamic and, effective regional or ganisation.. Second, BIMSTEC serves as a bridge between two majo r high-growth centres of Asia \u2013 South and Southeast Asia.. Connectivity is essenti al to develop a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable Bay of Bengal region.. Th erefore, BIMSTEC needs to address two dimensions of connectivity \u2013 one, upgra ding and dovetailing of national connectivity into a regional roadmap; and two, deve lopment of both hard and soft infrastructures.. BIMSTEC Free Trade Area Emerging? The discussions on BIMSTEC Coastal Shipping Agreeme nt and the BIMSTEC Motor Vehicle Agreement are in an advanced stage and are likely to be finalised soon.. Similarly, leaders are committed to an early conclu sion of BIMSTEC Free Trade Area negotiations.. Involvement of industries and business chambers thr ough BIMSTEC Business Forum and BIMSTEC Economic Forum; BIMSTEC startup conclav e, BIMSTEC Ministerial conclave at the India Mobile Congress to enhance co operation in the areas of information technology and communication, are some examples of various steps taken during the summit.. While, the summit has addressed all BIMSTEC priorit y areas, namely, poverty alleviation, connectivity, trade and investment, co unter terrorism and transnational crime, environment and disaster management, climate change, energy, technology, agriculture, fisheries, public health, people-to-pe ople contacts, cultural cooperation, tourism, mountain economy and blue economy, there a re no lofty promises in the declaration.. There is an attempt to follow up on ea rlier announcements and to focus on a concrete action plan.. Third, the leaders agreed to enhance the institutio nal capacity of the BIMSTEC Secretariat in order to enable the Secretariat to c oordinate, monitor and facilitate implementation of BIMSTEC activities and programmes.. Similarly, preparation of a draft charter for the BIMSTEC, enhancing its visibi lity and stature in international fora, is an important step forward.. Likewise, India has c ommitted to set up a Centre for Bay of Bengal Studies at the Nalanda University for res earch on art, culture and other subjects in the Bay of Bengal.. BIMSTEC: Alternative to SAARC? India\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs remarked in a press briefing before the Summit that BIMSTEC links the unique ecology of the Himalayas t o the Bay of Bengal, reflecting the growing political support and commitment from I ndia.. Some experts also envisage BIMSTEC as an alternativ e to the SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) process.. Inde ed, BIMSTEC holds a special significance for India in a changing mental map of the region.. Certainly, making the Bay of Bengal integral to Ind ia\u2019s \u2018Neighbourhood First\u201d and \u2018Act East\u201d policies could accelerate the process of regi onal integration.. Therefore, BIMSTEC matters for India and for the region.",

    "context": "COMMENTARY COVID -19 IS catapulting the digital economy to the fore.. Strained state finances, and a booming digital economy amidst social distancing and accelerating connectivity, spotlight the potential of taxing t his growing pie.. Negotiations for a multilateral tax treaty are ongoing in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s (OECD) even as the pandemic diverts political energy and provides pretext for delay.. Can countries cobble together a co nsensus, and in what ways will agreement be meaningful? State of Play Originally slated for a December 2020 deadline, the OECD\u2019s Inclusive Framework now aims to lock in by mid-2021 global guidelines on taxing multinational enterprises (MNEs) that meet a tentative revenue floor of 750 million euros.. Pillar One of the Framework would create rules for taxing digitally -enabled businesses that so far pay lower rates, despite a significant economic presence, because they do not have a permanent establishment in host economies.. Pillar Two , meanwhile, would introduce a minimum tax on MNEs.. The Framework\u2019s significance is manifold.. First, it reflects a longstanding debate over tax sovereignty: states lose out on an estimated US$20 0 billion per year to tax havens, and have struggled with taxing digital businesses.. Second , it would be an additional revenue stream in the digital economy, considering that the World Trade Organisation\u2019s e -commerce moratorium prohibits tariffs on elect ronic goods, and could contribute to domestic resource mobilisation (Sustainable Development Goal 17.. 1).. In providing some relief to governments, it could ideally mitigate attempts to squeeze revenue from elsewhere, such as increased inspections further straining international trade.. Third , sans consensus, the levying of potentially discriminatory unilateral taxes leaves the door open for disputes.. This may prompt retaliatory weaponisation of economic relationships, such as trade, in a global economy already suffering from a short supply of stability and certainty.. Breakthrough or Falling Through? With much riding on the line, can there be a global consens us? Familiar challenges beset a resolution.. COVID -19 is both fillip and obstacle.. As with many international fora, virtual summitry falls short in facilitating informal conversations necessary for diplomacy.. Multiple interests, moreover, are a hallmark of multilateral agreements.. The Inclusive Framework is no different.. Disagreement arises over scope.. It is unclear what MNEs are covered by the Framework.. While originally designed to target digital giants, this mainly entailed taxing US MNEs besides a ha ndful of Chinese and European firms \u2014 a move Washington decried as discriminatory, despite these MNEs being affected on grounds of being the main beneficiaries of the current rules -based economic system rather than citizenship.. Since then, consumer -facing businesses have been added to the list.. There is also debate over whether the Framework should be mandatory.. In December 2019, the Trump administration advocated for a Safe Harbour proposal, which would allow firms to voluntarily opt -in for Pillar One.. It is not, however, all doom and gloom.. Businesses are willing to comply with a global framework in lieu of a regu latory noodle bowl.. Much resistance is concentrated on Pillar One (taxing digitally -enabled businesses), but both the US and developing countries, which usually champion precautionary digital rule -making, have generally approved of implementing Pillar Two (introducing minimum taxes on MNEs) first.. Yet while the OECD\u2019s recent economic impact assessment suggests that governments may accrue more fiscal revenue through Pillar Two, many state s are pushing for a concurrent advance.. Pillar Two alone will not reallocate taxing rights in a digital age.. In this sense, it perhaps only partially ref lects broader contestations over the spoils of the digital economy.. Security Taxing Multilateralism To some extent, the digital economy is modifying the interests of different political -economic factions, but also historically like -minded countries such as the OECD membership.. Digital taxes are a bone of contention in the US -European Union relations.. Europe is now a source, rather than beneficiary , of rents or unearned profits.. Just as Washington under Trump opposes the taxing of its MNEs, which might cut into R&D funding and hence its technological edge, it is in Europe\u2019s interest to impose them.. Seen i n this light, the Trump administration\u2019s decision to abandon negotiations in June is perhaps unsurprising.. Some place high hopes for a reversal of fortunes following the US\u2019 November presidential election, which is still hanging in the balance at this time of writing.. Yet bipartisan consensus and differences with like -minded allies on digital taxes harks back even to the Obama era.. It remains to be seen whether a Biden White House augurs well for consensus, even if it could put greater multilateral involvement back on the cards.. Moreover, how much reliability and certainty can a rules -based order proffer if members selectively follow the ru les? Heightened national security concerns call into question the meaningfulness of any potential consensus, given a mindset shift in Washington over a fading liberal economic order and threatened American exceptionalism.. This is on top of other security concerns which might blunt the Framework\u2019s implementation.. For one, it is not clear how tax incentives will impact effective tax rates and hence revenues gained from the Framework; governments see them as a way of attracting investment and protecting econo mic security.. For another, levying these taxes can depend on exchange of information between jurisdictions.. Yet requests for data can be and are rejected on grounds of data insecurity or poor privacy and civil liberty laws.. This lack of capacity could disproportionately affect less developed countries in greater need of tax justice.. Way Forward: Reframe Global Negotiations? Overall, countries could go it alone in the event of talks breaking down.. Digital value - added taxes toe legal lines, for instance.. But this may be politically tone deaf in a post - COVID world where economic inequalities are front and centre \u2014 although corporate income taxes do not negate the odds of costs being passed on to smaller businesses and consumers regardless.. Alternatively, agreement without the US would be defanged considering the market share of American firms an d Washington\u2019s capacity for inflicting punitive measures.. Forging a consensus will hence be no easy feat, but necessary.. It may require treating digital taxes as part of a broader rather than standalone agreement, with compromises on this front being tra ded for concessions on digital trade.. To that end, putting the national security genie back in the bottle to de -escalate tensions and reframe negotiations will be a critical first step.. Still, only time will tell how other spectres of insecurity \u2014 whether economic or data -based \u2014 might hinder the realisation of a more sustainable global economic system, or a significant shift in power between states and markets overall.",

    "context": "COMMENTARY THE United Nations Review Conference of the Non -Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 2022 did not produce a con sensus document because Russia did not agree with the texts related to the occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) in Ukraine.. Such is the weight of the matter that discussions on a treaty concerning nuclear weapons non - proliferation and disarmamen t had reached a stalemate, all because of the safety of a civilian nuclear facility.. Over the last year, officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) had been allowed onsite to monitor the safe operation of the Zaporizhzhia NPP.. Although the agency expended enormous resources on the NPP, any compromise of its structural integrity owing to shelling by the warring forces could have resulted in a consequence far greater than the Chernobyl radioactive fallout in 1986.. Even though the reactors ha d been shut down, the NPP still remained a sitting -duck in the conflict zone.. The Zaporizhzhia NPP episode has highlighted how civilian NPPs can become centres of gravity during a war, and this has enormous implications for the design and reinforcement of NPPs going forward.. Going Underground for Protection Nuclear reactors around the world are built above ground and housed in a fortified containment building.. In the US, the Defence -In-Depth safety philosophy, which aims to prevent and mitigate accidents th rough overlapping layers of protection, ensure that such buildings have been designed to withstand the impact of an aircraft crash.. In 1988, Sandia National Laboratories carried out component testing that showed a containment building withstanding the impa ct of an F -4 fighter jet crash.. Following the 9/11 attack, computer simulations also concluded that containment buildings in the US can withstand the crash of a Boeing 767 commercial aircraft.. However, the impact of missiles are different from that of ai r crashes.. Firstly, the structural integrity of the nuclear facility would have already been weakened by artillery barrages during a battle.. Furthermore, the pressure exerted on the NPP will be much greater given the higher velocity of advanced projectiles comprising sharper shaped charges.. An NPP target will succumb to the penetrative and explosive effects of these missiles.. Although it is a war crime to attack a nuclear facility, international instruments and laws are inadequate to prevent attacks arisin g from miscalculations.. The reality, therefore, is that NPPs built above ground are vulnerable in a war, and the only way to reduce the risk of NPPs being attacked is to build the reactors underground.. An underground reactor not only possesses superior p rotection in times of war, but it also has a smaller footprint, which is a huge factor in winning public acceptance.. The advent of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) will also offer more flexibility for these underground reactors to be sited in or closer to cit y centres.. For densely populated countries like Singapore, it will certainly be a major policy consideration to have reactors built underground \u2013 both in consideration of nuclear safety as well as physical security.. Challenges in Emergency Response Building reactors underground is however a \u201cdouble -edged sword\u201d.. While it offers better protection, the nature of it is such that access to the reactors would be more challenging in an emergency.. For example, during the Fukushima nuclear disaster in March 2011, the reactors were doused with seawater as a last resort to cool the reactor cores and prevent them from a complete meltdown.. Had the reactors been built underground, it would have been more challenging to pump seawater into the reactors\u2019 ve ssels.. Evacuating personnel from an underground reactor during an emergency will also be a challenge.. Emergency plans for evacuation would need to be meticulously drawn up and rigorously exercised.. The easy access to and exit from an underground reactor during an emergency has to be balanced against the requirement for fortified security.. Currently, there are no IAEA guidelines on emergency responses for underground reactors.. Vendors developing such reactors will need to convince th eir regulators that not only will the entire plant remain safe during operation, but the safety of the operators are also assured.. Building such a reactor is not simply about assembling a conventional SMR in the factory and placing it underground.. An integ ration of safety, security and safeguards (termed the 3Ss) has to be embedded into the design philosophy.. NuScale Power Corporation has done several iterations of design and component testing to qualify for the US National Regulatory Commission (NRC) lice nce to develop an SMR that will be sited underground.. The growing preference for smaller reactors could reduce costs as having them underground could be cheaper than having them in containment buildings.. Hence, we could potentially see other vendors ventur ing into the domain of underground reactors.. The Way Forward The demand for underground reactors will increase, not only because they will be less vulnerable during a war.. An underground design is also more robust against earthquakes or tsunamis.. The fac t that an underground nuclear reactor will not be in the public eye could greatly ameliorate the Not -In-My-Backyard (NIMBY) syndrome.. In Singapore, the population, being well -educated, will have no doubts about the role nuclear energy plays in combating global climate change.. In 2008, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew had said that nuclear energy was the solution to Singapore\u2019s energy security and climate change issues.. With advances in nuclear safety technology, it is technically feasible for Singapore t o build an NPP.. The NIMBY syndrome will be easier to address if the reactor is built underground.. With new safety technologies and the feasibility of building nuclear reactors underground, the time has come for countries in Southeast Asia to curb their ca rbon emissions by adopting nuclear energy.. The region has deliberated on the issue for far too long, and our climate clock is ticking away.. What is needed are vendors with a proven SMR design, which is licensed by a credible regulator and is ready to be deployed.. The entry barrier to this niche nuclear industry is very high as the safety of populations and the environment cannot be compromised.",

    "context": "COMMENTARY PRESIDENT JOKO Widodo wanted a quick fix to Indonesia\u2019s problems attracting foreign investment, and Parliament has given him the tool he wante d \u2013 but the leader now has a new headache on top of the giant one from COVID -19, and efforts to lure investors are unlikely to produce results anytime soon.. On 5 October 2020, Parliament quickly approved a thick bill entitled \u201c Cipta Kerja (Job Creation)\u201d aimed at slashing red tape and making it easier for investors to create employment for millions of jobless Indonesians.. Based on the title, it would seem the new law would be welcomed \u2013 but the reaction has been the opposite.. Resistance to Omnibus Bill The law \u201ctramples\u201d on workers and will benefit only capitalists and conglomerates, complained the chairman of the largest Islamic organisation Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) \u2013 whose past leader of its Syurah (Supreme Council) is now Widodo\u2019s vice -president.. Amnesty International\u2019s Jakarta representative blasted the legislation as a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d for human rights and labour.. Social media was filled with attacks on planned changes in labour and environmental policies.. Governors of some Indonesian provinces called on Jokowi, as the president is more widely known, to revoke the law.. And there was negative reaction in the streets, with protests in dozens of cities for three days last week, some of them turning violent.. Crowds included students unhappy with Jokowi and so me people reportedly hired to make trouble by individuals with political agendas.. Still, there were thousands of workers who showed their disapproval of the legislation known as the \u201comnibus\u201d bill.. Opposition to his initiative to win over investors is th e latest in a series of setbacks for Jokowi this year.. COVID -19 has thrust millions back into poverty and the country into its first recession since the Asian Financial Crisis more than 20 years ago.. The need to jack up state spending to help the poor has meant construction of a proposed Indonesian capital in East Kalimantan \u2013 what Jokowi sees as a legacy project -- cannot start this year.. The ambitious omnibus bill, in one go, amends 79 existing laws that contain overlapping or contradictory policies.. Pro ponents of the bill hail it is a necessary effort to reduce cumbersome licensing requirements and paperwork in highly -bureaucratic Indonesia.. A World Bank economist has said the bill would have the potential to \u201cturbo - charge\u201d Indonesia\u2019s economic recovery from COVID -19.. While businesspeople generally welcome the law \u2013 and had the most input on its proposals \u2013 there has been strong resistance from civil society groups, who said they weren\u2019t able to give inputs, to proposed changes in labour and environment laws.. Attention on those areas may have obscured how much ground the law seeks to cover.. The independent Centre for Indonesian Policy Studies (CIPS) applauded changes in food and agriculture policies, including removing a 30% cap on foreigners\u2019 stakes i n plantation, horticulture and livestock businesses.. Jokowi: \u2018We Have a Problem\u2019 But a week after the bill was approved, it remained embarrassingly uncertain what the final version said, as it wasn\u2019t available and multiple drafts were circulating.. The of ficial reason for the delay: typographical errors were getting cleaned up.. Under Indonesian rules, a bill passed by Parliament will automatically become law in 30 days even if the president doesn\u2019t sign it.. NU said it will ask the Constitutional Court to reject the law, though it\u2019s not clear what grounds the group will cite -- and analysts doubt the court will rule the legislation is unconstitutional.. The bill stemmed from Jokowi realising last year how badly Indonesia was faring in attracting manufactur ers shifting production to Southeast Asia from China because of US import tariffs.. The World Bank said that of 33 relocations, 23 went to Vietnam and none to Indonesia.. \u201cWe have a problem,\u201d Jokowi lamented.. He thought an omnibus bill would reduce what he called \u201cregulatory obesity\u201d: Also, he was sure of getting it through Parliament, having support from nearly 75% of its members.. (He didn\u2019t have a majority in the first term).. Jokowi wanted Parliament, which received the massive original draft in February, to act within 100 days.. But then came COVID -19, and some stumbles by his government, which many saw as slow and ineffective in combatting it.. In April, Parliament began deliberating the omnibus bill, and si nce September it expedited handling.. Rigid Labour Market After the legislation was passed, Jokowi didn\u2019t say anything publicly for four days \u2013 during which anti -bill activity proliferated.. When he did speak, the president said opponents were \u201cmisinformed \u201d and many \u201choaxes\u201d misled people.. He challenged opponents to go the Constitutional Court to try to block it.. One major focus of opposition is change to a 2003 labour law that was pushed by then-President Megawati Sukarnoputri, who was about to be in the first direct presidential vote (which she lost).. That law gave workers maximum severance pay of 32 months\u2019 wages, one of the world\u2019s highest levels.. Business groups have long pushed to reduce that level.. Capital Economics, a consultancy, says one reason Indonesia has struggled to develop the labour -intensive manufacturing base that has underpinned success elsewhere in Asia is a \u201crigid labour market which makes it difficult to hire and fire workers\u201d.. A draft of the new law reduces the maximum to 25 months , with the employer paying 19 and the government covering six months under a new unemployment insurance scheme.. Opponents of changes in labour law contend the government could have detached the section from the bill and taken it up later, after COVID -19 has been contained and the economic situation isn\u2019t so grim.. They also question how the unemployment insurance is going to work, with the government currently cash -strapped.. Answer to Jokowi\u2019s Troubles ? The answers to that and other questions about the la w are supposed to come in the \u201cimplementing regulations\u201d for legislation.. Think -tank CIPS sounded a cautionary note on such regulations.. \u201cIndonesia is notorious for the slow or failed implementation of new laws,\u201d it said.. \u201cEnforcing this new law across 34 provinces will be no easy feat.. \u201d Jokowi said the implementing regulations will be completed within three months \u2013 which would be surprisingly fast for Indonesian bureaucracy.. The chief economics minister, Airlangga Hartarto, has said Jokowi wants it done in one month.. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible,\u201d says Yanuar Nugroho, deputy chief of staff to Jokowi in his first term.. The wait for those regulations and the fact there are almost no visitors to Indonesia at present, due to COVID -19, mean it could be a long time bef ore a bid to increase foreign investment produces results.. A key will be implementation of the law, as investors in Indonesia need \u2013 and often don\u2019t have \u2013 legal certainty ( kepastian hukum ).. The situation will remain fluid and attention will now be on Jokowi and the decisions he will make about the law.",

    "context": "COMMENTARY EUROPEANS ARE often quick to reserve the right to sanction third -party states on normative grounds.. This happened again last week, when the latest round of European Union sanctions targeted the usual suspects, including Russia and Myanmar.. What was new was that China has made it on to the EU sanctions list on human rights grounds for the first time since Tiananmen.. With this, European institutions joined the United States and others, targeting four senior Chinese of ficials and one entity for human -rights violations in Xinjiang.. Targeted Sanctions and Countersanctions The EU has an ambivalent relationship with China.. There is an omnipresent power tussle among the EU institutions as well as among member states over the right balance between economic interests and normative imperatives, a struggle between national economic interests and the EU\u2019s normative global ambitions.. Germany, for example , has long caused frustration among those in the EU who believe engagement with China should focus much more on questions such as human rights.. This \u2018lobby\u2019 includes the more forward leaning member states and, importantly, the EU Parliament which largely s ees itself as Europe\u2019s normative guardian.. Human rights abuses are serious and must receive international attention.. But it is common wisdom that the efficacy of sanctions is low, perhaps counter -productive.. In the EU, the primary objective of sanctions is, therefore, not an improvement inside the target country.. Instead, sanctions are an instrument of public diplomacy, a symbol of international protest, and not least addressing domestic public opinion and appeasing political dynamics inside the EU.. EU\u2019s First Dilemma: How to React Navigating the dilemma of having to react robustly without causing too much trouble for the sanctioned country is achieved by targeting a handful of lower -ranking individuals and entities with modest measures, including trav el bans and asset freezing.. This way, the targeted country is only minimally affected, often not even worth a reaction.. Not so this time.. While EU officials would have expected a Chinese reaction, they had not expected Beijing lashing out as they did, with countersanctions on ten European individuals and four entities, including the EU Parliament\u2019s Subcommittee on Human Rights, parliamentarians (includin g the EU Parliament\u2019s greatest China critic, the prominent German Green -MEP B\u00fctikofer), diplomats and think tanks.. Just like in Europe, Chinese sanctions are an instrument of public diplomacy.. China is not a small developing country but a superpower, and Beijing cannot be seen as passively accepting international sanctions.. A Dicey Investment Deal Germany\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel is its export driven economy and the automobile industry in particular.. It is no surprise that German Chancellor Angela Merkel was in strumental in concluding the EU -China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI).. This is an investment deal with which the EU hopes to level the hitherto asymmetric playing field for foreign businesses in China, long a serious concern in the EU, and Germany in particular.. Many EU MEPs, B\u00fctikofer included, were critical of the other EU institutions\u2019 and CAI\u2019s ignorance towards poor human rights standards in China, including forced labour.. And while Commission and Council can negotiate and approve the a greement, it is ultimately the EU Parliament that must give its consent for ratification.. Parliamentarians cancelled a meeting to discuss the deal in protest over China\u2019s reaction.. Of course, China must have predicted this reaction, leaving only one conc lusion: Beijing is signalling that they do not need to open up to the EU.. EU\u2019s Second Dilemma: Two Losers, One Winner The EU now faces a dilemma.. While Chinese sanctions are equally toothless, the difference to Brussels\u2019 sanctions is that Beijing\u2019s are clearly punitive, therefore highly confrontational.. This audacity enraged MEPs, many of whom had already been critical of CAI, the Greens in particular.. When the agreement now returns from \u201clegal scrubbing\u201d and official translation to Parliament for rati fication, Beijing\u2019s countersanctions jeopardise the outcome many national governments were hoping for.. There is still time for intra -EU diplomacy to convince a critical number of MEPs to support CAI.. Should the agreement be rejected, however, it will be E uropean industry that loses out, not China.. And yet, the atmosphere in Beijing is barely festive.. As is often the case, inept Chinese diplomacy is better at assembling a coaliti on of opponents than its actual opponents are.. US-EU Anti -China Alliance? With its counter -sanctions Beijing has undermined its own objectives.. With CAI, China attempted to drive a wedge between Washington and Europe, with success.. Although the vast ma jority of European leaders eagerly awaited a \u201cnew beginning\u201d post-Trump, Europe threw Joe Biden a curveball by rushing through CAI just before his inauguration, instead of waiting to coordinate with Washington\u2019s new China policy.. The White House reaction w as more than icy, leading to an early diplomatic tussle between Washington and European capitals.. But EU -China relations are taking a nose -dive just as the new US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken arrived for his first official Europe visit.. The tit -for-tat sanctions are a diplomatic manna for the US, and a stumbling block for those in China \u2014 and inside Europe \u2014 who argue that the EU should dissociate itself from Washington.. For the foreseeable future, a united US -EU anti -China alliance is unlikely.. Bu t Washington has done better than Brussels by delicately producing a \u2018frenemy\u2019 relationship with Beijing out of last week\u2019s Alaska talks.. The unintended consequence of technically harmless EU sanctions show how easily diplomatic dynamics can spiral out of control, possibly with lasting impact on the global balance of power among Brussels, Beijing and Washington.",

    "context": "COMMENTARY Indonesian pro -Islamic State (IS) terrorist organisations are significantly less lethal today than in the recent past.. Largely due to the mass arrest of senior leaders in 2018, well-known organisations like the Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) are now decentralised, leaving their cells unable to formulate a common strategy and to mobilise resources collectively.. Consequently, the frequency and lethality of pro -IS attacks have declined significantly.. In 2022, Indonesia experienced only one attack by JAD \u2013 the Astana Raya Bombing \u2013 which resulted in ten casualties.. Notably, this attack was significantly less lethal than its earlier attacks, such as the 2018 Triple Church Bombings in Surabaya which caused 58 casualties.. Despite their declining operational capacity, pro -IS groups have shown a degree of resilience in their ability to recruit members and to establish new cells.. A report by the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC) noted as of 2020, that pro -IS cells continued to emerge in areas that \u201chad no recent history of terrorism\u201d.. These included Pohuwanto, Gorontalo, whe re seven pro -IS men were arrested for plotting attacks, and Banjar Baru, South Kalimantan, where attack preparations were plotted.. In 2021, new pro -IS cells were still forming in Nganjuk, East Java.. To better understand how pro -IS cells are being regenerated, this author examined 996 court documents of terrorists arrested and convicted between 2011 and 2021.. Relevant information about them were stored in the Indonesian Terrorist Inmate (ITI) Dataset, which has been helpful in our understanding of the radicalisation pathways, organisational careers, and violent operations of convicted Indonesian terrorists.. The analysi s in this commentary is based on 235 cases involving members of pro -IS cells and groups arrested in 2018 (182 cases) and 2021 (53 cases).. They included members from pro -IS groups such as JAD, Jemaah Darussalam al Mubaroqah, and Anshor Daulah Villa Mutiara.. Indonesian Pro -IS Terrorists\u2019 Radicalisation Patterns Based on information from the ITI Dataset, two radicalisation patterns among pro -IS organisations were observed to persist between 2018 and 2021.. First, it was observed that most of their members wer e radicalised offline even though they were savvy with social media and the Internet.. In 2018, the data showed that 67 per cent of Indonesian pro -IS supporters were radicalised through offline processes.. They were mostly influenced at mosque sermons delive red by extremist ulamas (religious scholars and teachers) and at radical Quranic recital groups, both being the starting point of 80 per cent of offline radicalisation cases in 2018.. While some were radicalised online by propaganda disseminated through Fa cebook and Telegram, most of them were concurrently influenced offline by extremist sermons and Quranic recital groups.. In most instances, the commitment to the IS cause that developed online became stronger, manifesting into action only after it was reinf orced by group activities \u2013 as in the case of JAD Bogor and Bekasi members, Baban and Iswahyudi.. Overall, the data showed that only 9 per cent of pro -IS radicalisations in 2018 took place exclusively online.. Offline radicalisation of pro -IS supporters was also prevalent in 2021.. Notably, about 60 per cent of those arrested in 2021 were radicalised through solely offline means.. As in 2018, mosques and private Quranic groups were the most common starting point of an individual's radicalisation, accounting for 86 per cent of all offline radicalisation cases in 2021.. A lthough the proportion of pro -IS supporters radicalised online increased from 35 per cent in 2018 to 40 per cent in 2021, many were still simultaneously involved in offline processes as well.. Overall, purely online radicalisation occurred in only 13 per ce nt of cases in 2021.. The second pattern that persisted in 2018 and 2021 was the role of social ties in facilitating the radicalisation process.. Despite some claims that online self - radicalisation is a major threat, data actually suggested that most members of pro -IS terrorist organisations were radicalised either by or with someone they were personally familiar with.. Data from the ITI Dataset foun d that 73 per cent of all pro -IS supporters who were arrested in 2018 had a social relationship with another supporter who facilitated their radicalisation process.. In 2021, this percentage remained high at 77 per cent.. The data also showed that the most common social ties which facilitated radicalisations were the individuals\u2019 relationships with their ulamas followed by friendships and family ties.. In 2018, 32 per cent of the people radicalised involved a radical ulama they were close to, and 22 per cent involved introduction to radical materials by a friend or family member who was part of or on the way to joining a pro - IS group.. In 2021, these numbers remained about the same, with 34 per cent involving radical ulamas and 28 per cent involving a friend or family member.. The case of the Anshor Daulah Villa Mutiara group highlights the significance of social ties in the radicalisation of pro -IS supporters.. This group, located in Makassar, South Sulawesi, was brought together by Rizaldy whose radicalisation was facilitated by Ustad Basri, his ulama while he was a member of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI).. Rizaldy es tablished private Quranic recital groups and invited his siblings, their spouses, and former FPI colleagues to participate.. Even tually, the group expanded to 80 people and its most infamous terrorist couples, Ulfa and Rullie along with Lukman and Dewi, went on to perpetuate, respectively, the 2019 Jolo c athedral bombing and the 2021 Makassar bombing.. Looking Ahead In view of the persistent patterns of offline radicalisations involving social networks observed in 2018 and 2021, it is likely that these trends are still prevalent today.. It is therefore vital for the Indonesian government to conduct two things.. Firstly, it needs to collaborate with and expand the reach of civil society groups involved in the battle against extremism in offline settings.. Secondly, it needs to coordinate with and support \u201cPreventing and Countering Violent Extremism (P/CVE)\u201d organisations in implementing a \u201c whole of society \u201d approach to identify and to intervene early in radicalisation processes.. It is important, however, that this focus on offline radicalisation is not done at the expense of combating online radic alisation.",

    "context": "COMMENTARY TWO EGYPTIAN nationals and a Filipino were killed o n 5 November 2019 in Indanan, Sulu for an attempted suicide bombing.. Two suicide vests loaded with explosives, detonators, a loaded pistol, and a grenade were seized from the dead attackers.. This suggests that only two of the three perpetrators we re prepared to be suicide bombers, and a question mark remains as to whether the sole Filipino was one of the two.. The Egyptians went by the aliases of Abduramil and Yusop.. It was also noted that Abduramil\u2019s wife, Reda Mohamad Mahmud Mohamad, was the suicide bomber at a military checkpoint on 8 September 2019 which faile d to cause any fatalities.. This attack came shortly after the death of Abu Bakr al- Baghdadi, the self-declared caliph of the self-proclaimed Islamic State (IS), on 31 Oc tober 2019.. Trend of Suicide Bombings Al-Baghdadi\u2019s symbolic death by suicide bombing ser ves as propaganda of the deed , potentially encouraging sympathisers to \u201cmartyr\u201d th emselves as he did.. Coupled with the failing \u201ccaliphate\u201d in Syria after IS lost its final stronghold in Syria on 23 March 2019, it is assessed that foreign fighters are expe cted to relocate into another conflict theatre, such as the Philippines.. Two theories to the localisation of suicide terrori sm in the Philippines have been forwarded: the active recruitment of foreign suicide bombers and the local adoption of the tactic.. Currently, the former assessment has be en more proven as locals continue to resist the adoption of suicide bombing, going by the overwhelming foreign profile of suicide bombers in the country thus far.. To date, there are five suicide bombing attempts/at tacks in the Philippines starting from the unintended Basilan Vehicle-Borne Improvise d Explosive Device (VBIED) attack on 31 December 2018 which killed 10 and wounded 7.. This was a serendipitous moment for Hajan Sawadjaan \u2013 leader of IS Sulu and mooted emir of IS Philippines \u2013 as he recruited two members of the Indonesia-based Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) shortly after for a suicide attack which killed 22 and wounded more than 100 at the Our Lady of Mount Carmel Cathedral.. Based on those involved in suicide attacks in the c ountry, it appears that suicide bombings still heavily rely on foreign terrorist fi ghters.. Today, while there have been eight individuals who conducted or attempted suicid e bombings in the Philippines, only one Filipino was identified as a suicide attacker.. The culture of upholding the honour of the warrior \u2013 to die during fighting \u2013 among ind igenous Moro tribes in Mindanao may have prevailed thus far to resist the perceived glory of suicide \u201cmartyrdom\u201d.. Moreover, the five suicide bombing attacks and atte mpts demonstrated that the adoption of this tactic is contained within the Sul u region; four attacks were conducted on Jolo island.. These tactics are only actively pur sued by IS Sulu which operates in the Sulu archipelago; not within mainland Mindanao.. In contrast, recent attacks launched by the Maguidanao-based Turaife-led factio n of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) still favour remotely deton ated bombs.. Trajectory of Suicide Bombings We can expect more attempts to introduce suicide bo mbings along the Sulu Archipelago.. However, if local resistance to the ad option of suicide bombings persists, IS Sulu may step up the recruitment of foreign mili tants into Mindanao if it intends to make suicide bombings a staple in their arsenal.. Th is would allow them to dispense high casualty attacks through foreign suicide bombe rs while maintaining their trained local fighting force to defend their territorial sa nctuaries.. The Sulu route is one of many foreign militants use to travel into Mindanao.. It is preferred as smuggling through that route is relati vely not difficult.. The porous border and troubled waters between Malaysian East Sabah an d the Philippines\u2019 Sulu islets create opportunities for human smuggling into Minda nao.. Hence, IS Sulu\u2019s mere presence in that region differentiates them from th e other militant groups in Southeast Asia as they are able to actively smuggle foreign m ilitants.. This was observed when Indonesian militants Rullie Rian Zeke and Ulfah Handayani Saleh who conducted the Jolo Church suicide attack, were smuggled through East Sabah by IS Sulu.. This route is also used by non-regional foreign fighters who see Malaysia as a transit between the Middle East and S outhern Philippines.. Coupled with the potential relocation of foreign fi ghters from Syria after IS lost its territory and leader, the IS East Asia Wilayat (ie.. Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Myanmar, and Japan) could beco me one of the recipients of fighters from Syria.. Bids to recruit deportees who attempted to fight in Syria and returnees would pose a serious threat to the securi ty of the Sulu archipelago.. Sharing of Intelligence Given the trend, it is critical that the Philippine s government adopt a comprehensive set of policies to harden its borders.. This include s intelligence sharing mechanisms which leverages on transnational arrangements to de ny entrance of foreign fighters.. Proposals to expand the Trilateral Cooperative Arra ngement (TCA) \u2013 joint patrols between the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia at the Sulu-Celebes Seas \u2013 to improve force coordination and intelligence sharing should be considered.. Key also is to monitor the movements of foreign fighters who ha d fought in Syria and are now eyeing their next battle-ground.. Initiatives to coordinate with the Turkish governme nt and other intelligence platforms such as the \u201c Five Eyes \u201d could also be considered to monitor and deter pos sible relocation of foreign fighters to the Philippines.. Ultimately, terrorism is a transnational threat whi ch requires a transnational arrangement.. Governments must create more platforms for cooperation and intelligence sharing to interdict its transnational networks effectively.. This would then allow respective governments to manage and contain the threat locally.",

    "context": "Commentary ASEAN HAS long been an advocate of cyber confidence building measures (CBMs) for cyberspace; in 2014, and ASEAN was seen as a wo rld leader in Cyber CBMs.. But ASEAN and its dialogue partners, like the ASEAN Reg ional Forum (ARF), have not moved past the diplomatic quagmire that has bogged down the development of CBMs.. For example, a list of points of contact was mooted by ARF members as early as 2012 but has yet to see fruition due to objections from some members.. Despite these obstacles, ASEAN still recognises the importance of cooperation and developing CBMs and norms in cyberspace.. Singapore and Thailand, as the outgoing and incoming chairs of ASEAN, pledged to continue t he discussion on cybersecurity at the ASEAN summit in November 2018 to promote an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful ICT environment.. This is se en as critical to connectivity and economic development.. Challenges in Cyber Confidence Building Measures (C BMs) Just two months earlier, at Singapore International Cyber Week 2018, Singapore was tasked by the ASEAN Ministerial Conference on Cyber security (AMCC) to develop a framework for cooperation in cyberspace; confidence building measures among the various ASEAN member states will be needed for any cooperation to be successful.. There are many challenges that need to be overcome in building this ASEAN-wide cooperation mechanism.. Some ASEAN Member States hav e insufficient capacity to participate in cyber CBMs.. For example, Myanmar\u2019s n ational Computer Emergency Response (MMCERT), has only five employees serving the cybersecurity needs of the whole country.. In other ASEAN states, there is insufficient commun ication between the technology industry, government, academia, civil society, and the public.. Companies are reluctant to report incidents because they fear loss of busin ess, or because reporting is too onerous; while governments are reluctant to share i nformation, which may be classified.. This in turn hinders the free sharing o f information between countries.. Sydney Recommendations for ASEAN CBMs Track II dialogues \u2013 or discussions involving acade mia, industry, and civil society \u2212 can smoothen this process of building confidence an d encouraging discussions for cyberspace.. The writer was invited by the Australia n Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) to participate in a project that was part of the AS EAN-Australia Special Summit in March 2018 and supported by the Australia-ASEAN Cou ncil.. The project was to suggest practical confidence bui lding measures in cyberspace in the ASEAN region that can be readily implemented.. T his process brought together leading experts in international affairs and/or cyb er affairs from think-tanks, research institutes and universities from across the ASEAN r egion.. The product of those discussions is The Sydney Recommendations on Practical Futures for Cyber Confidence Building in the ASEAN Region , which was launched in September 2018 at the Singapore International Cyber Week.. CBMs that were raised range from the coordination o f planned and ongoing unclassified cyber activities, to professionalisati on of cyber capacity building efforts among ASEAN member states, and the expansion of ASE AN Computer Emergency Response Team Incident Drills (ACID).. CBMs are gene rally undertaken to avert hostilities, minimise escalation of hostilities, an d build trust among states, which is sometimes in short supply in cyberspace.. Role of Track II in ASEAN Cyber Discussions The Sydney Recommendations illustrate how Track II can contribute towards cyber cooperation in ASEAN.. To maximise this contribution , ASEAN Track II needs to uplift its capabilities to better support Track I discussi ons.. Under such circumstances, informal discussions by t hink-tanks and other non-state actors such as businesses and industry groups on Tr ack II should play an important role in helping move the discussion on regional cyb er cooperation forward.. These discussions at Track II level should provide a non- threatening environment to discuss and informally advise the various governments on th e development of policies, how to carry out or recommend capacity building activities , and to understand the constraints that each state face.. The formulation of the framework on ASEAN cyber coo peration needs to be a regional initiative that represents the ASEAN region.. Singap ore has in the past facilitated Track II discussions among academia, civil society groups , and industry groups from within and outside the region.. Examples are the Global Com mission on the Stability for Cyberspace (GCSC) and the Global Forum for Cyber Ex pertise (GFCE) to bring diverse views on how capacity can be built in cyber space.. Paucity of Cyber Policy Discussions Even so, the Track II discussions surrounding the S ydney Recommendations show that ASEAN member states tend to prioritise the bui lding of technological capabilities such as infrastructural protection, threat detectio n and digital forensics; and place less priority on cyber policies and strategies.. The pauc ity of cyber policy discussions at Track II level reflects this trend, and there is cu rrently a capacity deficit in cyber policy research at Track II in ASEAN.. However, entities with more expertise, such as thin k tanks which are already working in this field, can contribute to building capacity in cyber policy at Track II for the region.. If this is successful, Track II can support governm ents in creating the vibrant and stable cyber ecosystem laid out by ASEAN leaders.",

    "context": "COMMENTARY United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Sec urity (WPS) calls on the international community to incorporate gender perspectives in frameworks analysing international security issues.. There is growing debate on the relationship between climate security and women that is merging with existing literatu re on women and armed conflict.. An understanding of women\u2019s vulnerabilities in climate change is essential to understanding the magnitude and urgency of the issue and should be investigated and addressed as an integral part of ASEAN\u2019s climate security ar chitecture.. ASEAN could pursue this through its WPS Regional Plan of Action (RPA).. Women and Climate Change The UN has already begun to broach the intersection between climate change, and women and security , arguing the connection between resource scarcity and violent conflicts and proposing the strengthening of women\u2019s networks to engage in dialogue and mediation pr ocesses around natural resources management.. The effects of climate change have broad gendered implications due to the entrenched inequalities women face in accessing and managing key resources such as water, food and energy.. In understanding women\u2019s role in climate change, it is essential to understand their role in making decisions about natural resources and how these decisions manifest regionally.. Take the water sector for example.. Successful and effective water projects are vital in a new climate real ity.. There is evidence that water projects designed and run with the inclusion of women to the maximum extent possible are more likely to succeed in the long term.. However, the reality is that women across Asia and the Pacific lack representation at the management level in the water sector.. The argument for more active participation by women in discussions on climate change and food security is borne out by the 2021 OECD report , which stated that over a quarter of the female labour force in Southeas t Asia worked in the agriculture industry and in food production.. And, according to the Asia-Pacific Forum on Sustainabl e Development held in March 2022, 48 -75 per cent of employed women worked in the agriculture and agricultural value chains in Cambodia, Myanmar, Lao PDR and Vietnam.. Women are also under -represented in the energy sector in Southeast Asia.. This under -representation is partly due to sociocultural norms , which limit the presence of women in employment and hence impeding the move towards a gender -just energy transition.. It is this author\u2019s assessment that policymaking should include the participation of women and should cover all levels \u2013 from grassroot s to corporations \u2013 to ensure equitable decision -making on vital resources.. We have to recontextualise our understanding of security and climate change to include gendered understandings of adaptation to and mitigation of the impacts of climate change.. By not integrating gender analysis into every level of security discourse, climate security policies will continue to miss the crucial inputs of women in analysing the catalysts of social fractures, like increasing gender and class divisions, and discriminat ion, as well as seizing opportunities for innovative adaptation and mitigation strategies.. WPS Regional Plan of Action in ASEAN The WPS RPA is a result of decade s of political engagement in the ASEAN region as expressed by the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women in the ASEAN Region (2004), and the ASEAN Regional Plan of Action on the Elimination of Violence against Women (2015).. ASEAN leader s also adopted the Joint Statement on Promoting WPS in the region in 2017.. In addition, the ASEAN Ministerial Dialogue on Strengthening Women\u2019s Role for Sustainable Peace and Security in 2020 further drove the integration of WPS across the three ASEAN comm unity pillars, which are: Political -Security Community, Economic Community and Socio -Cultural Community.. The ASEAN WPS RPA, launched in December 2022, is the latest regional effort to further acknowledge and increase sensitivity to women\u2019s role in confli ct prevention and peacebuilding.. While we applaud the launch of a regional plan on WPS in ASEAN, we should not lose sight of this opportunity to make the agenda work for the region by including new threats, such as climate change.. Adopting ASEAN\u2019s own ver sion of a WPS RPA independently without emulating RPAs from elsewhere, most of which focus on the threat of armed conflict, would go a long way to ensure the success of the agenda here.. I take my cue from the growing global conversations on WPS and climate security.. Acknowledging the threats of climate change facing women is a start, especially in vital areas of economic, food, water, energy, and health securities, as well as complex emergencies that result from natural hazards and human insecurities.. All of these will only be exacerbated by climate change.. One way of addressing these concerns in an inclusive manner would be through the integration of the four WPS pillars, i.. e.. , protection, prevention, participation and women\u2019s active role in relief and r ecovery, as essential parts of the existing climate security architecture, and not to see women as an area of \u2018special interest\u2019; subjective and analysed outside of existing climate adaptation and mitigation frameworks.. Beyond ASEAN Community 2025 In pla nning to move beyond the ASEAN Community 2025 agenda, existing regional frameworks should look to merging concerns for a better appreciation of threats to different groups of people.. One such merger should be that between frameworks that address violence a gainst women and gender inequality, and those that address climate change.. Policymakers will need to adopt cross -cutting approaches to incorporate gender into their areas of expertise to mutually feed into their policy gaps.. In this way, ASEAN will fully utilise and strengthen existing frameworks to address concerns around gender equality, climate security, and peace in the region.. This would help to identify policy blind spots that might compromise the effectiveness and reach of climate change policies.. This is also a good way to maximise the advantages of having an ASEAN WPS RPA.",

    "context": "COMMENTARY CHINA MADE waves recently i n financial circles when it trialled its Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) \u2013 a digital renminbi \u2013 across four cities in April 2020.. The trial was expanded when the People\u2019s Bank of China announced that the city of Shenzhen will distribute RMB10 mi llion (around S$2 million), for free, in a lottery system to residents, which they can spend the e -renminbi in selected merchants and in their city\u2019s metro system.. The lottery was oversubscribed with two million registrants vying for 50,000 digital \u2018red pa ckets\u2019, each worth 200 Chinese yuan.. The Chinese experience catalysed a wave of discussions by central banks around the world \u2013 how best to harness and implement a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), and what good will it bring to the state? It is worth bearing in mind that CBDCs are not the sole remit of nation states as regional groupings are showing keen interest as well.. Regional Interests & ASEAN Digital Currency? The European Union, for example, has accelerated its efforts into studying how a digital euro could be initiated and public consultations have taken place since 12 October this year.. While the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) recently introduced a single currency (the eco), crypto -enthusiasts pointed out how this was a missed opportunity to digitalise the currency on blockchain technology.. It is timely, then, for ASEAN to kickstart discussions on the possibility of a CDBC and how such an \u2018ASEAN Coin\u2019 might look like.. The most obvious benefit of an ASEAN digital currency is that it would dramatically lower cross -border transactions and payments.. Where a company would previously exchange currency to pay for cross -border goods or services, an ASEAN digital currency promises to cut out middleman costs for currency exchanges and make payments instantaneously.. Plugged in with the latest developments in the sphere of \u2018decentralised finance\u2019 and \u2018smart contracts\u2019, it has the potential to be radically transformative.. This would also be synergistic with existing ASEAN projects su ch as the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), ASEAN Investment Area (AIA) and the ASEAN Connectivity 2025 roadmap.. An ASEAN Coin can certainly be catalytic to the emphasis on establishing ASEAN as a \u201csingle market and production base\u201d and having a \u201cfree and open investment regime\u201d.. Second, a 2019 Bain report suggests that seven out of 10 Southeast Asians are underbanked or unbanked, having \u201cno access to c redit cards or have no long -term savings product\u201d or \u201cwithout access to a basic bank account\u201d.. An ASEAN digital currency can bring financial inclusion to the millions of unbanked and underbanked ASEAN citizens and small businesses.. For example, a fisherm an in Indonesia could theoretically be plugged into the ASEAN financial ecosystem with a smartphone \u2013 and do business directly with other ASEAN companies and end consumers - without holding a bank account.. Promoting ASEAN Financial & Political Centrality Third, an ASEAN digital currency can help the bloc preserve its financial and political centrality.. Given the maturity of the Chinese e -renminbi, it is only a matter of time before it gets rolled out nationally.. When that happens, the next natural step is to blend the e -renminbi into its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and regional diplomatic efforts.. It is reported that merchants in Seoul \u2019s Myeongdong District (which sees substantial Chinese tourists) are open to transacting in the e -renminbi.. Given that Alipay and WeChat are already common payment options in much of Southeast Asia, it would be rather frictionless to transit into the e -Renminbi system.. In any event, having an ASEAN CBDC could bolster the regional group\u2019s financial autonomy \u2013 ensuring that it does not have to rely on any major power for financial inclusion or be overly dependent on extra -mural forces for its fintech archit ecture.. To be sure, ASEAN countries are already at various stages of developing their own CBDCs.. Singapore and Thailand\u2019s experimentations with CBDCs are at a very mature stage and could see pilot implementations shortly.. Other ASEAN countries such as the Philippines are considering introducing a CBDC.. In that way, technical know -how and expert knowledge already exist at the ASEAN level to get things going.. Vision of ASEAN Coin & Its Challenges Notwithstanding the potential for ASEAN countries to create an ASEAN Coin, there remain considerable challenges to realising this vision.. First, digital infrastructures differ significantly.. A few countries are substantially ahead of others in having robust and technically sound digital eco -systems.. Singapore, fo r instance, ranks fourth worldwide in the global connectivity index and has a mobile penetration rate of around 150 per cent.. This is far higher than Laos, which saw its mobile penetration rates reach only 54 per cent in 2017, while Internet penetration ra tes stood at 43 per cent in January 2020.. Next, and perhaps the biggest challenge is to convince political leaders that an ASEAN digital currency do not necessarily have to entail a pooling of sovereignty nor having a single monetary system.. An ASEAN wide digital currency could model itself after Facebook\u2019s Libra template \u2013 pegging it to a basket of ASEAN currencies \u2013 thus ensuring price stability and without the need for countries to give up their national currencies.. The central banks of member states must then ensure that this ASEAN coin is liquid and easily exchangeable to respective national currencies.. In any event, previous infrastructural, financial, and economic disparities have not prevented ASEAN from setting ambitious goals such as the realisa tion of an ASEAN Economic Community.. Unintended Consequences As with any novel ideas, the prospects of unintended consequences remain.. An ASEAN Coin, could, foreseeably throw the national monetary policies of ASEAN countries out of whack.. Even so, adopti on could take a staggered approach where it is trialled with selected ASEAN industries before being rolled out to other sectors.. Implementation could also be fraught and questions over money laundering with such a regional currency must also be confronte d.. Nevertheless, the pandemic has shown in very stark terms how cookie -cutter solutions that have worked for so long, needs serious re -thinking.. While it may be some way off before an ASEAN -wide digital currency becomes a reality, it is imperative that AS EAN member states start thinking about this possibility in a post -physical currency world.. As various political actors around the globe advance their CBDC projects, the defining inequity of the near future may not be financial inequality but technological inequality.. As such, conversations about an ASEAN currency, centered on financial inclusion with ASEAN know -how, should start now.",

    "context": "COMMENTARY AT THE historic Bretton Woods Conf erence of 1944, to address the economic instability of the 1930s, a set of rules -based international economic institutions (IEIs) that are collectively referred to as the global economic architecture (GEA) was established under the leadership of the United States.. This architecture comprised the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for macroeconomic and monetary stability; the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \u2013 the predecessor of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to promote trade openness; and the World Bank to provide development finance for poverty reduction.. Although it had several critical flaws, the Bretton Woods GEA worked well for more than 60 years arguably until the eruption of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC).. It ushered in the golden age of globalisation and brought about economic growth and prosperity all over the world.. Gradualist Reform & the Changed Context Reforms of this architecture have been implemented in an incremental and gradual manner.. These comprise (i) the establishment of the G7 in 1975 and its upgradation to the G20 summit in the aftermath of the GFC; (ii) a shift to a floating system of exchange rates in 1973 after the collapse of the pegged rates of the Bretton Woods monetary arrangement; (iii) the establishment of the Financial Stability Forum and its upgrading to the Financial Stability Board after the GFC; and (iv) the transitioning from GATT to the WTO in 1995.. More recently, the context in which the global IEIs operate has changed in two important ways.. First, the unipolar world with the US as the sole superpower has become multi -polar where economic and political power has shifted to some extent to the dynamic emerging markets, particularly those in Asia such as China and India.. These emerging markets have sought a greater voice in the operation of the IEIs.. But the major Western shareholders remain antipathetic to the required changes in rules and policies.. Second, during the Bretton Woods era, policymakers were wary of uncontrolled finance and had imposed restri ctions on cross -border flows of capital.. In the 1990s, under the so -called Washington Consensus, countries around the world deregulated their capital accounts.. Over time, this has produced highly integrated global financial markets and capital flows that h ave dwarfed the regulatory capacity and operations of IEIs.. With financial globalisation, a new type of crisis associated with large capital inflows and their sudden reversals have become more frequent occurring every 10 to 12 years.. In addition to insta bility, financial globalisation has also led to intra - and inter - country income inequality.. Calls for Big Bang Reforms: Bretton Woods 2.. 0? Calls have, therefore, been made for a comprehensive reform of the Bretton Woods GEA.. In the post -GFC period, a num ber of academics and politicians had called for a New Bretton Woods (NBW), a wider and more comprehensive reform of the GEA.. These had included Professor Joseph Stiglitz and politicians like Nicholas Sarkozy and Gordon Brown.. The then central bank govern or of China, Zhou Xiaochuan, had also made a pitch for a new international reserve asset to replace the US dollar and its hegemony.. The calls for a NBW fizzled out at the interregnum stage because the recovery from the GFC turned out to be faster than ex pected and the world experienced a Great Recession rather than the originally expected repeat of the Great Depression of the 1930s.. This led to complacency and dilution of reform proposals.. Similar calls for comprehensive reforms of the Bretton Wood GEA h ave been made in the wake of the COVID -19 pandemic which has led to the worst global economic downturn since the Great Depression.. According to the latest IMF estimate, world output shrank by 3.. 1% in 2020 as compared to 0.. 1% in 2009.. Gallaghar and Kozul -Wright have noted that inequality, indebtedness, and insufficient productive investments have become the new normal and called for a renewed multilateral order.. Tinkering with existing rules cannot provide the way out.. Vines argues that the world now faces two choices (i) revisit the direction of t he mid - 1940s when ruled based GEA were established or (ii) return to the path of the 1930s when weak cooperation led to an economic depression and eventually a world war.. He adds that the crises of this century proves that there is an urgent need for funda mental reform by learning lessons from history.. What lessons can be learned from COVID -19 and the invasion of Ukraine? Will they be game -changing events and lead to the overhaul of the global economic architecture? If so, how? Going Forward Looking for ward, will the calls for Big Bang reform of the Bretton Woods GEA be realised any time soon? Probably, not.. This is because with the recent rise in nationalism and populism worldwide and the on -going conflict between the US and China and the Russia -Ukraine War, the political will to spur global cooperation and coordination is weak and risk of yet another East -West divide reminiscent of the Cold War era world order is genuine.. Under former President Trump, the US had embraced the \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy and protectionism pivoting away from multilateralism of the past to \u201cunilateralism\u201d and \u201cbilateralism\u201d.. President Biden is supportive of multilateralism but still many of the tariffs that were imposed on about 20% of total imports of the US remain.. Similarl y, European countries had initiated policy actions to protect their economies especially from rising inflows of migrant workers from the Middle East.. Countries around the world also retaliated and became more inward -looking.. Although it remains an export p owerhouse, China has also stressed the importance of domestic market when it rolled out the \u201cdual circulation\u201d policy paradigm.. Since 2020, India has also adopted a more self -reliant policy.. Rising nationalism and growing emphasis on economic security hav e dimmed the environment for global cooperation.. Countries are preferring to \u201cgo it alone\u201d rather than cooperate with others.. Weak political will is the main reason why the G20 has failed to craft a coordinated global response to the unprecedented COVID -19 pandemic.. In the medium -term, therefore, reforms of the Bretton Woods GEA are expected to be incremental and gradual rather than Big Bang.. The key focus of reforms should be to provide global public goods in a shared manner by promoting complementarity between global and regional IEIs that have been recently established.. The centralised Bretton Woods GEA is gradually moving towards a decentralising GEA with the co -existence of \u201csenior\u201d global IEIs and a plethora of new regional institutions.. The world could be in for a turning point in the wake of the Ukraine War.. How the sea - change will emerge remains to be seen.",

Despite Pakistan being China\u2019s \u201call-we ather strategic cooperative partner\u201d since 2015, the Chinese have signalled the relative importance of neighbouring India in their expanding foreign policy calculus.. This is evident from the recent Chinese attitude towards India although it has not joined C hina\u2019s worldwide Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).. Advocacy of Closer Sino-Indian Ties The BRI is a collective name for the multi-modal co nnectivity projects that radiate from China across continents and cover diverse spectra o f economic activities.. Ahead of the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Co operation (BRF) in Beijing on 26- 27 April 2019, China knew India would not attend th e summit.. It was no secret that India felt that its BRI concerns were being disrega rded by China.. However, prior to the Second BRF, Chinese Ambassado r to India, Luo Zhaohui, emphasised the \u201cvision\u201d of \u201cachieving [Sino-Indian] synergy on the Belt and Road Initiative\u201d.. Luo\u2019s call for creating BRI \u201csynergy\u201d ranked fourth in his priorities for improving Beijing\u2019s often-chequered relations with Delhi.. Topping Luo\u2019s \u201cvision\u201d was the need for \u201cnegotiating and signing China-India T reaty of Good Neighbourliness and Friendly Cooperation\u201d.. He suggested bilateral \u201cfree trade agreements\u201d and consultations to reap \u201cearly harvests\u201d even while patiently settling the Sino-In dian boundary dispute.. Two factors explain Luo\u2019s advocacy.. Masking Modi\u2019s Absence at BRF Firstly, Chinese President Xi Jinping chaired the S econd BRF precisely one year after he held an unprecedented \u201cinformal summit\u201d with Ind ian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Wuhan, China.. For Xi, the Wuhan summit was \u201ca ne w starting point\u201d in Sino-Indian diplomacy.. Modi, too, said India and China crossed a new \u201cmile stone\u201d in bilateral diplomacy during the Wuhan summit.. So, new ideas like Luo\u2019s may actu ally help in masking Modi\u2019s absence at Xi\u2019s latest BRF Roundtable on 27 April 2 019.. Secondly, there is a nuanced explanation for Luo\u2019s advocacy.. India\u2019s opposition to the BRI initially became known when Modi, despite being invited by Xi, stayed away from the First BRF summit in Beijing in May 2017.. India\u2019 s opposition was, and continues to be, driven by two strands of reason.. The first reason is that a key BRI project \u2013 the Ch ina-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) \u2013 passes through a disputed area that Islama bad controls and India claims as its legitimate sovereign territory.. Contrary to the BRF\u2019s norm of \u201cextensive consultation\u201d for project finalisation, India feels , its sensitivities were \u201cignored\u201d by China before it finalised the CPEC with Pakistan.. A New Message from BRF The second reason for India\u2019s opposition to the BRI is somewhat subtle.. India hints that the BRI projects are not \u201cbased on universally recognised international norms\u201d.. Apparently in response to this criticism, the Secon d BRF affirmed as follows on 27 April 2019: \u201cAll states are equal partners for coop eration that respects openness, transparency, inclusiveness and level playing field.. We encourage.. a greater role of development finance in line with.. the agreed principles by the UNGA [United Nations General Assembly] on debt sustainability\u201d.. The BRF\u2019s affirmation of faith in the UN norms of \u201c debt sustainability\u201d is noteworthy.. \u201cDebts\u201d owed to Beijing and/or Chinese entities by their partners were becoming a BRI controversy in some quarters.. Chinese diplomats hav e even viewed India as a key campaigner against China\u2019s alleged \u201cdebt trap diplo macy\u201d towards BRI partners.. \u201cDebt sustainability\u201d is, therefore, the latest BRF messa ge that India cannot easily ignore any longer.. In this milieu, Luo\u2019s proposals for updating Sino-I ndian diplomacy are essentially aspirational.. Why? A \u201cfriendship treaty\u201d is a creat ive idea whose time is yet to come.. A \u201cfree trade agreement\u201d is conceivable.. However, C hina and India may first have to strike a harmonious chord during the ongoing negoti ations for Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).. ASEAN is piloting the RCEP parleys.. Not really new is the idea of seeking \u201cearly harves ts\u201d while negotiating a settlement of the Sino-Indian boundary dispute.. Moreover, the dis pute is seen by both sides as a comprehensive strategic issue that cannot be easily compartmentalised.. As for BRI \u201csynergy\u201d, India still sees the Chinese initiative as a bridge too far in bilateral relations.. An Emerging Sino-Indian Ambience Nonetheless, some indices of India\u2019s emergence as a potential powerhouse are of interest to global China.. These are India\u2019s economi c \u2018rise\u2019, nuclear arsenal, growing \u2018harmony\u2019 with America, diplomatic proximity to Rus sia, and scientific \u2018military\u2019 prowess in the Outer Space.. In the Outer Space, hum anity\u2019s future frontier, India is emerging as an early pioneer behind the United Stat es, Russia and China.. However, there is nothing to suggest a fanciful com ing collapse of Sino-Pakistani \u201ciron friendship\u201d or a reversal of China\u2019s latest pledge of support for Pakistan\u2019s \u201cnational dignity\u201d.. The new dynamic in Sino-Indian diplomacy, therefore, is China\u2019s review of India, as is explicit in Luo\u2019s proposals.. Refining China\u2019s review of India after the Second B RF, Luo disclosed, on 6 May 2019, that \u201cwe are [still] expecting India to be part of the BRI\u201d.. In his view, participation in the BRI would be \u201cthe key\u201d to a \u201csolution\u201d of India\u2019s c oncerns over its huge trade deficit with China.. China\u2019s messaging to the next Indian go vernment, expected to be formed later this month, cannot, therefore, be missed.",

    "context": "Commentary THE CONNECTION between modernity, fundamentalism an d violence can help us better understand why an increasing number of indiv iduals from the privileged class are involved in terrorism.. The detention of educate d Singaporeans who hold good jobs in a First World country, and who embrace modernity , is a case in point.. It no longer holds true that actors of terrorism ar e the \u201cdown and out\u201d who are disenfranchised or deprived of life\u2019s opportunities and who live in under-developed parts of the world.. A surreal but true fact is that fundamentalism is born out of the womb of modernity.. Anxiety, Uncertainty and Disillusionment This statement may appear contradictory because the modern individual is expected to respect diversity, be open-minded and balanced i n managing his or her life.. However, the modern person can also, paradoxically embrace traits which are diametrically opposite and engendered in fundamenta lism, such as intolerance to diversity, close-mindedness and extremism in conduc t as well as thinking.. A discussion on how modernity has paradoxically con tributed to fundamentalism, notwithstanding its role in giving birth to contemp orary civilisation, is necessary to understand the involvement of the privileged class in acts of terror.. Modernity empowered humankind with the power of rea son, freedom in thinking and critical thought.. The right to freedom and to think , even critically, brought about a phenomenal increase in diversity and pluralism that the world had never experienced before.. In short, modernity driven by rationality ( through science and technology) and freedom (through secular democracy) generated mind- boggling changes due to the onslaught of differences and diversity.. This is aggravated by the devaluation of the absolu te truth or big picture thinking in preference of a multiplicity of \u201ctruths\u201d based on e ach individual\u2019s perspective, in what has been popularly termed today as the \u201cpost-truth world\u201d.. Such a world, also known as the perspectival world, will further increase di versity and intensify pluralism exponentially.. The moderate response is to embrace change that div ersity brings about, while maintaining a judicious balance between what should be changed and what should be retained, such as principles and values.. This balan ced approach will provide society with the moral ballast to ensure its well-being as it encounters increasing diversity brought about by modernity.. Change and Certainty in an Uncertain World But the extreme way of responding to increasing div ersity is to keep on changing.. This is happening.. Nothing escapes change and there is n o notion of permanence.. Everything will be relativised and principles and v alues that make society safe, secure and peaceful are discarded.. Relativism does not give due regard to the concepti on of what is good and bad, thus weakening the anchors that provide stability to soc iety.. This will eventually lead to moral nihilism \u2013 that nothing is intrinsically mora l or immoral.. This will create a lot of imbalance, disequilibrium in society and hence unce rtainty.. The uncertainty causes great anxiety.. As a result, some modern and successful individuals will respond by going back to a notion of faith that provides certainty in a world that is otherwise uncertain.. This is what fundamentalism is.. It is a return to an extremely o ld interpretation of religion that is protected from the preserve of reason or scientific critique.. Fundamentalism, as so defined, is intended to provi de a quick and easy way to overcome problems in society today due to uncertain ties in life.. To do so, the fundamentalist will export the early or historical religious experiences embedded in sacred text and traditions to apply them to present times.. Perceived War of Good Versus Evil A serious problem arises when fundamentalism is emb raced by individuals who have the propensity to commit acts of extremist violence or terror.. They believe that their encounters with the problems of modern society toda y, due to moral nihilism and moral relativism, are an imagined war between the forces of good and evil.. They view this as a repeat of the war between good and evil that happened in the religion\u2019s historical past.. This comes as no surpri se as the early history of religion is many times marked with conflicts, wars and bloodshe d.. According to Robert Bellah, a global sociologist of religion, founders of religions emerged in history when the ruling elites and ways of life in society were mired in immorality, conflict and violence.. The religious in terpretations of the past, relevant to those early days but no longer valid today, provide the inspiration for fundamentalists who are prone to violence.. They make believe that a situation of war exists today, and that they are thus justified to annihilate the evil s of modern society.. They feel obligated to carry out this war because t hey believe that it is their \u201cdo or die\u201d mission to restore what they define to be a moral a nd good society.. Religious fundamentalism is today the popular source to provi de perpetrators of violence with the impulses and motivations for acts of terrorism.. Fundamentalists believe they have the monopoly of t ruthful interpretation of texts which render everybody else\u2019s interpretation as imp ure.. Those with this puritanical attitude position themselves as the only saviours o f the society they live in.. No other interpretation is valid and those who propagate con trary views can be killed even if they belong to the same faith as they are labelled as apostates.. The war-like orientation of these fundamentalists, self-justified by sacred content selectively interpreted from within the religion, c auses them to go down the slippery slope of waging war against the enemies of God (pri marily from the West) who caused the uncertainty and immorality in society.. Not All Fundamentalism Lead to Violence Nevertheless, there is a qualifier.. Not all fundame ntalism lead to violence.. There are fundamentalists who reject acts of violence.. The discussion on the link between modernity, funda mentalism and violence is aptly summarised by global scholar on religion, Julius Li pner.. Recognising that fundamentalism exists in modern society, he caution ed about the danger that it can lead to, when that society becomes perspectival and accords less importance to the use of universal reason.. This is because the result ing trajectory is unpredictable and it often leads to violence.. Already, we can see this happening in our world.. An increasing number of individuals involved in terror attacks are modern, global and s uccessful, but disillusioned with the secular forces of modern society that give rise to evils and immoralities.. Their perspectives shaped by religious fundamentalism mot ivate them to commit acts of violence or terror in their struggle to actualise a good and moral society.. The nexus between modernity, fundamentalism and violence impl ies that global terrorism will continue to be a threat for a long time.",

    "context": "Commentary ASEAN PROVIDES the Southeast Asian region with a st rategic umbrella for important economic, political, security and socio-cultural in itiatives.. The ASEAN experience has demonstrated that it offers a successful and progre ssive model of regional cooperation in disaster management.. It is most notable in disas ter response where the ten ASEAN member states have come together to provide a regio nal coordination mechanism for disaster relief.. In 2011, the ASEAN Coordinating Centre on Humanitar ian Assistance on disaster management (AHA Centre) was established -- a signif icant milestone in regional cooperation on disaster response and disaster manag ement.. Five years on, reflecting on its successes, three key elements can be identif ied \u2013 political will, operational capacity and emotional bonds \u2013 that were critical t o regional cooperation in disaster response.. Political Commitment Since the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami killed an estim ated 230,000-280,000 people and devastated coastal communities in 14 countries, the ten ASEAN member states have solidified their political commitment to disas ter management.. The ASEAN Agreement on Disaster Management and Emergency Resp onse (AADMER) was signed on 26 July 2005 in Vientiane, Laos \u2013 six mon ths after the tsunami \u2013 which was a quick turnaround for a regional agreement.. It ref lected the scale of the disaster and the political will to cooperate in such a crisis.. The AADMER was essentially the political and legal commitment to deepen cooperation on disaster management in the region.. E mbodied in the agreement was the commitment to establish the AHA Centre.. The agr eement came into legal force in 2009, and the AHA Centre was established two years later in Jakarta.. This was made possible by the agreement to set up the AHA Centre signed at the ASEAN Summit in Bali, Indonesia in November 2011.. More recently, in 2015 ASEAN member states unveiled the ASEAN Vision 2025 on disaster management, which outlined what the region should achieve in the next decade.. In 2016, to achieve faster, bigger, and uni fied response towards disasters, Leaders signed the ASEAN declaration on One ASEAN O ne Response: responding to disaster as one, in the region and outside.. Operational Engine After the AHA Centre was established in 2011 it bec ame the full-time \u201coperational engine\u201d to turn political commitment, policies and decisions into action.. It operates multiple aspects of coordination such as informatio n management, operating procedures, regional response planning, resource mo bilisation including the emergency response fund, the ASEAN Emergency Respon se and Assessment Team (ASEAN-ERAT), and the Disaster Emergency Logistics System for ASEAN (DELSA).. These form the main operational mechanism and instr uments of disaster response at the regional level.. The AHA Centre has the mandate, the mechanism and the funding to turn words into action.. This all came about because practitioners equipped with an emergency mindset sit together on the ASEAN Committee on Disaster Managem ent (ACDM) which focuses on execution and delivering fast tangible results.. It is this committee that designed and governs the AHA Centre.. Emotional Bonds Disaster management is a prime example of a people- to-people connection in ASEAN.. In an ASEAN disaster response, the ASEAN-ERAT train together, deploy together and have their own network for keeping in contact.. Simi larly, the AHA Centre Executive (ACE) programme lasts for a six-month period during which time strong bonds of friendship develop.. The ACDM and its working groups also build trusting relationships and friendships through numerous meetings and events including the ASEAN Regional Disaster Emergency Response Simulation Exercise (ARDEX).. Thi s emotional bonding instills the \u201cwe feeling\u201d because as soon as disaster strike s the responders are not meeting strangers but friends.. This is a unique element of regional cooperation in disaster response as it is much easier to work with people y ou know and trust.. These three elements \u2013 political will, operational capacity and emotional bonds \u2013 are mutually reinforcing.. If invested together these th ree components are well placed for successful regional cooperation in the field of dis aster management.. Seven More Years to Vision 2025 Scanning the horizon, it is important to recognise that there are seven years left to achieve ASEAN Vision 2025 to become a global leader in disaster management.. ASEAN is well-placed to make this happen through sh aring its expertise outside the region, developing stronger links with universities and think tanks like RSIS to provide global thought leadership on disaster management, a nd continue to build trust and capacity in ASEAN on disaster management.. However, it is important to consider two issues tha t will determine the future of the AHA Centre.. The first is to ensure adequate financi al contributions by member states to enhance the sustainability and the capacity of t he AHA Centre.. The second is the future role and function of the AHA Centre as it co ordinates regional response beyond natural disasters.. Going forward, it is also important for the AHA Cen tre to remain focused on operations, continue to maintain the trust and confidence of th e ASEAN member states, and for the ACDM to remain in the driving seat.. It is important to continue the momentum ASEAN has generated to reach its stated aim of becoming a global leader in disaster managem ent by 2025.. It is a bold, ambitious and important vision that will transform ASEAN and ensure it stays relevant not only in the region but also in the world in dis aster management.",

    "context": "COMMENTARY IT IS futile to debate whether Russian President Vladimir Putin had anticipated the determination and unity of Europe or was surprised by it.. But as a matter of fact, the European Union (EU) and its member states are currently untying several \u201cGordian Knots\u201d at once.. Take Germany as an example: Russian aggression has achieved what decades of US diplomacy could not: Berlin is finally realising that Germany must take care of its own, and by extension European, security.. For decades, Germany\u2019s European neighbours, from France to Poland, as well as successive US administrations have tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to put an end to German free -riding on the NA TO and US security umbrella.. Berlin had long been lacking to both equip its armed forces, the Bundeswehr, adequately and to think strategically about the defence of and challenges for Germany and Europe.. The Historic German Volte -face Despite being the second largest NATO economy, hitherto, it was hopeless to expect Germany to meet its NATO defence budget obligations of 2% of GDP.. Berlin\u2019s strategic culture , domestic politics and an entrenched public pacificism made raising the defence budget as difficult as developing a realistic security strategy appropriate for a country so prone to geopolitical challenges.. Likewise, the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with Moscow was long a \u201choly cow\u201d of Berlin\u2019s diplomacy, preventing both the export of arms to Ukraine as wel l as unambiguously joining its NATO allies in hard -balancing Russian influence.. For example, the much - discussed gas pipeline Nordstream 2 was, despite its obvious geo -strategic nature, long described as a \u201ccommercial project\u201d by successive German governments.. In a series of dramatic moves within just a few days, Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced a historic volte -face that seemed to take even members of his own government by surprise.. Upending decades -old fundamental principles of German foreign and security policy, Berlin is now delivering lethal weapons to Ukraine, announced a one -off tripling of th e defence budget as well as the intent to henceforth meet NATO\u2019s spending target.. Likewise, to reduce Germany\u2019s significant dependency on Russian energy imports (every fourth household relies on Russian gas for heating), even Green party leaders agree tha t Berlin will now likely have to postpone its exit from both coal - and nuclear - energy, and Nordstream 2 is now all but finished.. New EU Unity The President of the European Commission announced a series of measures that denoted a similarly remarkable shif t in EU Common Security and Defence Policy.. Most astonishing for an organisation that self -identifies as a \u201cnormative actor\u201d, the EU will now for the first time finance lethal weapons.. To that end, \u20ac450 million will go towards Ukrainian armament \u2013 a countr y that is not even a member.. Beyond defence, member states demonstrated unusual unity in agreeing to substantial sanctions against Russia, including the long -resisted removal of Russia\u2019s leading banks from SWIFT.. Not only will this come at significant cos ts for European economies themselves, but this agreement also bridges the traditionally significant divergence in European perspectives on economic and diplomatic relations with Moscow.. No less remarkable, only six years after the so -called refugee crisi s brought the EU close to breaking point, even those member states that long resisted EU -wide refugee distribution, indeed were opposed to receiving any migrants at all, are now welcoming Ukrainian refugees with open arms.. Never Waste A Crisis: Europe\u2019s Moment of Truth \u201cEurope will be forged in crisis\u201d, Jean Monnet, one of the EU\u2019s founding fathers, famously asserted.. Indeed, there seems to be nothing quite like a geopolitical crisis to remind member states of the mutual security imperative of r egional integration, to galvanise and unify Europe.. Indeed even Boris Johnson shows a renewed interests in cooperation with the EU.. This momentum should not be squandered.. In the medium -term, there might be a welcomed spill -over effect, possibly solving one of Europe\u2019s most intractable problems: creating a functioning migration regime.. If the rest of the EU shows now this forthcoming solidarity with its Eastern member states that these states lacked during the 2015 refugee crisis, Europe might once again find the cooperative spirit to progress with deeper integration and policy reform, strengthening Europe\u2019s collective capacity.. Similarly, substantial German investment in defence can significantly enhance Europe\u2019s defence capacity and work towards Europe\u2019 s ability to implement own strategic objectives.. Mindful that a shortage of money was never the Bundeswehr\u2019s primary problem, greater defence spending must be accompanied by structural reforms and strategic embedding of German capabilities in a European fr amework.. A Re -energised Europe? Lastly, part of the truth about Europe\u2019s new unity is the fact that for the first time in decades, Washington very closely cooperated with both NATO allies and the EU institutions on a collective response to a security cri sis.. This cooperative spirit is, however, highly dependent on personalities rather than permanent structural change of US foreign policy.. It is indeed likely that a second Trump administration had reacted very differently, side -lining rather than galvanis ing European cooperation, which would likely have led to political inertia rather than resolve in Europe.. It is time to seriously consider advancing Europe\u2019s \u201cstrategic autonomy\u201d.. This does not mean competition with NATO.. Rather, strategic autonomy should be a European capacity to determine own strategic interests with the means to achieve them \u2013 complementary with but independent from NATO.. Putin has unwittingly shaken Europe out of complacency.. The previously unimaginable is suddenly reality, and the E U is already stronger and more effective and attractive than before Putin\u2019s war against Ukraine.. A second \u201cBrexit -like\u201d scenario seems unlikely now, and if there is only one good thing that may come out of this tragedy, it might be a re -energised Europe.",
