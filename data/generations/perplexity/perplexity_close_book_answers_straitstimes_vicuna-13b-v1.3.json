It boasts a number of well-regarded, profitable companies. And its exports to other developing countries allow us to think of ourselves as benefactors, and therefore leaders, of the Global South.. Our success exporting generic medicine in particular has led us to take a dim view of modern patent protections \u2013 and we have soaked up the approval of anti-Big Pharma activists in the West.. We ought to be a little less self-satisfied and a little angrier.. For more than a decade, it has been clear that too many medicine-makers in India have not been doing their duty by their customers, here and abroad.. That\u2019s bad in any industry \u2013 and outright infuriating when it comes to medicine.. In 2022, local investigators linked Indian-origin medicine to multiple deaths of children in Africa and Central Asia.. Bloomberg News reported recently that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has sent out dozens of notices to Indian pharmaceutical companies as it restarts its on-site inspections post-pandemic.. Many of these firms are accused not only of negligence, but also of deliberately ignoring warnings.. The Pentagon is so worried about the quality of generics that it is independently testing medicine meant for US soldiers and their families.. Doubts about Indian drugs will have dangerous ripple effects. Without Indian-made generics, pharmacies across the world would be much emptier.. The FDA, for instance, has banned drugs produced by Intas Pharmaceuticals from being imported into the US.. That will hurt the millions of patients who rely on the company\u2019s generic version of the cholesterol drug Lipitor. Indeed, US regulators have had to make exceptions for some of Intas\u2019 cancer drugs, which are already in very short supply.. There is a distinct possibility that economic nationalists in the US could seize on examples such as Intas to force the on-shoring of medicine production, even of generics that can and should be made cheaply and efficiently elsewhere.. That would raise prices and reduce supply for everyone.. This is hardly a new problem. More than a decade ago, Ranbaxy Laboratories \u2013 then considered the jewel of India\u2019s pharma sector \u2013 had to recall tens of thousands of bottles of its generic version of Lipitor for fear that they contained tiny fragments of glass.. That was just the beginning of a series of revelations about the quality of Ranbaxy\u2019s medicine \u2013 oil specks in some tablets, falsified trial data, adulteration \u2013 that eventually caused the company to fold in 2014.. The saga left neither India\u2019s pharma sector nor its regulators looking very good.. Apparently, they have not improved much. Sure, part of the problem is that the FDA limited inspections of manufacturing facilities in India during the Covid-19 pandemic.. The agency needs to staff up its overseas offices, including the one in New Delhi. But what were Indian regulators doing?. Why did it take a few small teams of foreign regulators to uncover this level of wrongdoing?. India\u2019s drug regulators \u2013 whose authority is divided between the federal and state governments \u2013 need to work harder to raise their standards to those prevailing in the Western world.. Too often, Indian regulators respond to reports of substandard exports by going into a defensive crouch. After cough syrup from one north Indian firm apparently caused the death of 70 children in the Gambia late in 2022, Indian regulators wrote to the World Health Organisation insisting the factory had \u201ccomplied with specifications\u201d.. India\u2019s muddled pharma regulation is emblematic of a broader failure to upgrade state capacity sufficiently to build trust in Indian products. The industry has 36 different regulators, allowing for unscrupulous fly-by-night operators to shop around for the most pliable jurisdiction.. Fixing this is not rocket science. We have to consolidate all these regulators into one, make sure that inspection records and reviews of drug applications are made public, and put all generics manufacturers through the same tests as companies making new drugs.. Until that happens, children across the world will continue to die \u2013 and, eventually, mistrust of Indian products will grow so intense that countries will stop buying from us.. You cannot be part of global value chains if you do not build up a reputation for transparency and regulatory energy at home.. While multiple sectors need attention, it would be smart to start with one whose decisions are literally life or death.. India\u2019s leaders sometimes like to claim that we are the \u201cpharmacy of the world\u201d. If so, we need to take that responsibility more seriously. BLOOMBERG",

    "context": "China\u2019s reopening at the end of 2022 was widely expected to trigger a robust rebound in economic activity after a year of rolling lockdowns and movement restrictions under a rigorously enforced zero-Covid policy. But recent economic data has belied such expectations, indicating instead that China still faces severe challenges in getting its economy back on track.. The weakness is evident across multiple areas. Foreign direct investment (FDI) in the first quarter of 2023 fell 34 per cent year on year to about one-third of the level in the same period of 2020. Factory activity has been falling since March, with the purchasing managers\u2019 index indicating further declines ahead. Exports in May plunged by 7.5 per cent year on year, far exceeding the 0.4 per cent decline forecast by a consensus among economists, with double-digit declines to major markets, including the United States, Japan and South-east Asia. Economists now predict exports will contract in 2023 as a whole, neutralising a significant engine of growth.. Domestically, continued weak housing starts suggest that the beleaguered property market has yet to turn around, despite policies to speed up the completion of unfinished developments. And while consumer spending on services such as restaurants and travel \u2013 which had been suppressed during the pandemic \u2013 has been relatively buoyant, spending on goods has been weak, suggesting that domestic demand remains sub-par.. Given this gloomy data, meeting the government\u2019s 5 per cent gross domestic product growth target for 2023 could prove challenging. Moreover, China\u2019s weak post-pandemic rebound means that it is unlikely to be as significant an engine for regional growth as previously assumed. A 15 per cent decline in imports of semiconductors in May could, in particular, be of concern to economies with large electronics sectors, such as Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan.. China\u2019s government is under some pressure, including from Communist Party-run media, to revive the economy. While it has limited room to boost exports in the face of weakening demand in some of its major markets in the West because of monetary tightening and import curbs, it has options to help the domestic economy. Economists expect that it will likely further ease monetary policies to expand the supply of credit, although there are concerns that much of this will flow to state-owned enterprises rather than the more dynamic private sector. The central government also has the policy space for a fiscal stimulus, which would be especially helpful given that many local authorities are cash-strapped. Relaxing the crackdown on the technology sector as well as on foreign consulting firms doing due diligence would also help revive FDI.. Overall, the nature and size of the government\u2019s policy response will determine how effectively it can ensure that its economic reopening lives up to its promise.",

    "context": "\u201cMake sure to look your age.\u201d. This was my friend\u2019s blunt advice to me when I told her I was gearing up for a fellowship interview a few weeks ago.. Puzzled, I assured her that reporting assignments and previous internships had prepared me to dress formally and appropriately for the occasion.. \u201cNo, not just that. Be sure not to appear \u2018too young\u2019, perhaps put your hair up and avoid pinks or pastels,\u201d she said, a suggestion I found somewhat amusing.. My friend, who like me is petite and around 1.5m tall, had recently been told during an interview for an overseas posting that she was too young for the job despite having the eight years of experience asked for in the advertisement.. While she could not know for certain why the company was not keen on her after the meeting, she felt it had to do with her appearance \u2013 that she was deemed unsuitable as she looked younger than her 30 years.. Her experience got me thinking about the way employers may judge a candidate\u2019s eligibility for a job based on appearance. While looking well groomed and professional for an interview shows that the candidate is serious about the position, looking \u201ctoo young\u201d despite being competent is something beyond the control of millennials and Generation Z job seekers.. While ageism is commonly associated with discrimination against older workers, \u201creverse ageism\u201d refers to the challenges of workers in their 20s and 30s who are hampered by age-specific stereotypes, such as being inexperienced and naive, that employers have of people of their age group.. Reverse ageism is not new, but it has been in focus lately among younger employees in post-pandemic times, as many bemoan the disruptions to their career development, finances and life plans over the past three years.. A study by the American Psychological Association in 2017 noted that younger employees actually experienced an equal or higher level of workplace discrimination than their older colleagues.. A survey by the National Trades Union Congress\u2019 Employment and Employability Institute in 2019 looked at how millennials responded to stereotypes about their generation. While most agreed that millennials are prone to job-hopping and are tech-savvy, they disputed the stereotypes that they are selfish and unable to take hardship or instructions from a superior.. Some respondents said many millennials faced challenges that were different from and, in some cases, worse than those of the previous generation. These include degree inflation, a term referring to the declining value of degrees as more people have access to tertiary education; the constant need to recalibrate their skills to meet technological changes; and a longer trajectory to reach life milestones, like home or car ownership.. Ageism, like other forms of discrimination, is intersectional \u2013 meaning age intertwines with other aspects of a person\u2019s identity, such as gender and economic status. Taken together, their disadvantages in the workforce increase.. A 2021 review on reverse ageism published on the American National Institutes of Health\u2019s website noted that compared with their male peers, there was significant discrimination against younger women applying for highly skilled administrative jobs, reflecting the double whammy of both ageism and sexism in the workplace.. Many of these findings made me realise that the conventional idea of how to look and act at different ages of our lives no longer applied to people of my generation and the generations to come.. Add to this the fact that we are marrying and parenting later in life, and have different sets of responsibilities and priorities compared with previous generations, with many renting rather than owning housing, travelling significantly more than our predecessors, and pushing for more work-life balance.. The years of living with Covid-19 have also affected the way we look and behave. For instance, a 2021 study in medical journal The Lancet found that the prevalence of smoking among young people had decreased at the global level by approximately 33 per cent over the past 30 years.. There are fewer drinkers too. A report by the BBC in 2022 found that more young people were embracing being \u201csober curious\u201d \u2013 drinking less and choosing to socialise while being sober \u2013 as a result of fewer opportunities to socialise or drink during the pandemic.. In terms of mental health, millennials, who were dubbed the \u201ctherapy generation\u201d by a 2019 Wall Street Journal article, are seeking help more often than the previous generations.. Such lifestyle choices may continue to play an important part in how we age and the choices we make in the future.. In her widely shared May 2023 article in British Vogue titled \u201cWhy do so many millennials look and seem so much younger than they are?\u201d, writer Daisy Jones looked at how millennials are ageing differently from their predecessors, partly because the norms surrounding age-specific lifestyles and clothing have changed.. Jones interpreted being called \u201cyounger\u201d as not being taken seriously, despite her achievements and credentials.. I have seen these changing norms in women who are juggling motherhood and their careers in ways others may deem unconventional.. A relative in her mid-30s went on hiatus from full-time work after the birth of her first child a year ago and is considering a postgraduate degree while pregnant with her second child. In the meantime, she is doing remote project-based work that pays well.. Given the disruptions, employers must act and workplace culture must change to tackle both forms of ageism when it comes to hiring, career progression and flexible working arrangements, in order to avoid generational conflict between younger and older workers.. An article on job portal MyCareersFuture.sg noted that ageism at the workplace leads to a decrease in productivity and meritocracy, as the focus falls on workers\u2019 age rather than their skills and talents.. One way to tackle reverse ageism is to provide more opportunities for older and younger employees to interact through mentoring and training programmes, to let them learn from and understand one another better.. Another option is for companies to consciously recruit and build intergenerational teams to capitalise on the strengths of different age groups.. Tapping young professionals\u2019 guilds and groups, as well as networking opportunities, will also allow young people to bank on a support network of peers to help them navigate their career paths.. In future, safeguards against reverse ageism, which is often difficult to address, should also be reflected in national labour laws and company policies, such as moving away from looking at a candidate\u2019s years of experience to the quality of the experience, and instituting diverse hiring panels that value the inputs of both junior and senior employees.. This will help foster greater inclusivity in the job market, so that workers with potential can focus more on the job than on how their appearance, lifestyle choices and personal views are perceived in the workplace.",

    "context": "James Chin. Irony was the highlight at Umno\u2019s annual general assembly last week.. Malaysia\u2019s Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who was sacked during the party\u2019s Supreme Council meeting back in 1998, returned as guest of honour.. He even sang the party\u2019s anthem while waving the flag.. The convention held at the World Trade Centre Kuala Lumpur was meant to serve as a focal point for Umno president Zahid Hamidi, as he prepares the party for six crucial state elections set to take place in the next two months.. Kelantan, Terengganu and Kedah, often called the core Malay states, are led by the opposition Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS).. Selangor, Negeri Sembilan and Penang are led by Datuk Seri Anwar\u2019s Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition and ally Barisan Nasional which includes Umno.. It took a quarter of a century for reconciliation between Umno and Mr Anwar.. But that wasn\u2019t the only surprise at the assembly.. One of the talking points from the post-convention press conference was Datuk Seri Zahid\u2019s invitation to party members who were sacked or suspended after last November\u2019s general election, suggesting a hint of desperation.. He said Umno was open to welcoming those who appeal.. Many took it to mean that he was willing to let the \u201cwarlords\u201d (powerful party figures), who were not re-nominated to stand in the November polls, return.. They include former Selangor Umno chief Noh Omar, former Ketereh MP Annuar Musa, Sembrong MP Hishammuddin Hussein and former Rembau MP Khairy Jamaluddin.. Critics have cited the absence of the heavy-hitters as a major reason why Umno did so poorly in November.. But the former members have signalled severance with Umno as long as it is controlled by Dr Zahid or former prime minister Najib Razak, who is now serving a 12-year jail sentence for graft linked to the 1MDB scandal.. Mr Noh and Mr Annuar have joined the opposition coalition Perikatan Nasional (PN) and will likely be given seats to contest in the upcoming elections.. Mr Khairy is likely to stand as a PN candidate as well if his conditions are met. The talk in KL is that he will stand if offered the post of chief minister.. Mr Hishammuddin, who is serving a six-year suspension, has said on multiple occasions that he will not appeal. The anti-hopping law, which came into effect in October 2022, would mean that he will lose his MP seat if he moves to the opposition or resigns from Umno.. Other former Umno members are unlikely to take up Dr Zahid\u2019s offer, simply because they left the party unhappy with Dr Zahid or Najib.. But the party president\u2019s sudden offer of an olive branch to former members seems to hint at a sense of nervousness within Umno heading into the state elections.. The reason for such a bold move by Dr Zahid seems clear.. Umno has seen a steady decline in votes since the early 2000s. This has also been reflected in the shrinking number of its MPs in Parliament.. In the 2004 General Election, Umno managed to get 35.7 per cent of the popular vote under the leadership of Tun Abdullah Badawi. In the most recent general election last November, Umno\u2019s popular vote was 16.43 per cent.. In 2013, Umno won 88 seats in Parliament, while it won just 26 seats in 2022\u2019s polls.. Despite its declining trajectory over the past decade, the party has not made any significant reforms to attract Malay voters.. This has given the opposition PAS an opportunity to secure all seats in the states of Kelantan and Terengganu. If the 2022 voting trend continues in the upcoming state elections, it could spell trouble for Umno.. Another challenge is to maintain unity within the alliance.. Given some of the speeches by Umno delegates at the convention, there are real fears that PH and Umno will struggle to work together at the grassroots level.. This is especially true of Umno and the Democratic Action Party, another coalition partner.. The ability of Mr Anwar\u2019s Parti Keadilan Rakyat to work with Umno\u2019s electoral machinery will be key to the alliance regaining Malay support in the upcoming elections.. Perhaps that could explain why Najib, the former Umno president, was still called upon at the assembly despite his absence.. Najib remains highly influential within Umno.. It\u2019s popular opinion within the party that Dr Zahid\u2019s faction is often referred to as the Zahid-Najib faction.. This was evident when several speakers openly called on the party to get Najib out of prison, as chants for his release echoed in the assembly.. It was a powerful reminder that a significant portion of Umno is still in Najib\u2019s grip, and many believe he was a victim of political persecution.. This seems to be what Dr Zahid was playing to in his closing speech when he talked about visiting Najib in the Kajang prison.. Dr Zahid has to send a clear signal that the party will not abandon Najib.. So even as he hopes for Umno to work with parties in the coalition, he knows he has to be mindful of the loyalties within the party that need to be appeased.. As the balancing act from within and beyond the party unfolds, it further highlights that Umno\u2019s future, to a large extent, hinges on the upcoming state elections.. From opening the door to expelled members to engaging in a show of solidarity with Mr Anwar, Dr Zahid seems to be pulling out all the stops.. Should Mr Anwar and Umno fail to regain Malay support, both Umno and the Anwar administration will almost certainly become unstable.. A Malaysian government cannot survive without the support of a majority of the Malay population.. Time is of the essence.",

    "context": "It is perhaps emblematic of the current strategic scenario that two days after using the Shangri-La Dialogue to issue another call for a sit-down with his Chinese counterpart, General Li Shangfu, United States Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin should have been inspecting an honour guard in New Delhi, with India\u2019s defence minister in attendance. Mr Austin subsequently spoke about an \u201cambitious new road map\u201d for defence ties between the world\u2019s No. 1 military power and India, the world\u2019s biggest arms importer, which will fast-track co-development and co-production of weapons, among other things.. More will be known when Prime Minister Narendra Modi travels to the US for a June 22 summit with President Joe Biden, but credible reports indicate that significant announcements, including a potential sale and technology transfer to India of GE F414 aircraft engines, are on the anvil. Long dependent on the Soviet Union and its successor state Russia for weapons supplies, New Delhi has steadily advanced purchases of Western war equipment, importing some US$20 billion (S$26.8 billion) worth from the US alone since 2008. Tellingly, it grounded its fleet of Soviet-era MiG-21 fighters in May for a safety check.. The accelerating US-India strategic embrace is both a function of their shared apprehensions about rising Chinese power as much as mutual economic interest, including a perceived need to shift supply chains away from a dependence on China. Also of growing salience to US strategic interests are the hundreds of thousands of Indian engineers who, sitting in their home country, provide a variety of critical services to the US ranging from routine back-office support jobs to advanced aircraft design and artificial intelligence. In American universities, the student intake from India now exceeds that from China.. Long described as \u201cnatural allies\u201d because of common bonds such as the English language and democratic systems, the US and India often were on opposite sides during the Cold War era. The Soviet collapse provided the opening for the two to become closer, and this has accelerated as Chinese power, and assertiveness, rises. Much of Indian war equipment on the Chinese border currently is of US origin, even as New Delhi has tried to balance ties with Russia by buying from it advanced missile defence systems and oil, in defiance of American warnings. In a nod to Indian prickliness about retaining strategic autonomy, the US tends to refer to it as a \u201cmajor defence partner\u201d rather than \u201cnon-Nato ally\u201d. The Pentagon says the two nations are committed to \u201cstrengthen operational collaboration across all military services\u201d. If that involves diluting India\u2019s allergy towards military alliances, we shall soon know.",

    "context": "Robert Shrimsley. So here\u2019s a thought. Instead of pushing ahead with a technology that its leading inventors say could soon have the power to kill humans, how about not pushing ahead with it?. This radical notion is prompted by a warning from the man setting up the British prime minister\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) task force.. Matt Clifford observed that: \u201cYou can have really very dangerous threats to humans that could kill many humans, not all humans, simply from where we\u2019d expect models to be in two years\u2019 time.\u201d. On second thoughts, maybe I\u2019m overreacting. His full remarks were more nuanced and anyway it\u2019s not all humans. Just many of them. But similarly apocalyptic warnings have come from leading figures in its development, writing under the aegis of the Centre for AI Safety.. In an admirably succinct warning, a Who\u2019s Who of the AI industry stressed that: \u201cMitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.\u201d. The heads of Google DeepMind, OpenAI and umpteen others have taken time off from inventing the technology that could wipe out all human life to warn the rest of us that, really, something should be done to stop this happening. And these guys are supposed to be the geniuses?. Across potting sheds in England, there are any number of slightly wacky guys who have invented a new machine which might be brilliant but might also burn down their house, and most of them have managed to work out by themselves that maybe the device is not such a great idea after all.. This is where the small-fry inventors have been going wrong. Perhaps instead of figuring out the risks for themselves, what they really needed to do was score several billion pounds\u2019 worth of venture capital funding and then write a letter to the local council warning that they really ought to be controlled.. I recognise, to be serious, that great things are expected of artificial intelligence, many of which do not involve the obliteration of the human race. Many argue that AI could play a pivotal role in delivering a carbon-free future, though perhaps that\u2019s just a euphemism for wiping out humanity.. Just as important is that the advances already made cannot be uninvented. But already AI chatbots are falsifying information \u2013 or \u201challucinating\u201d as its developers prefer to put it \u2013 and its inventors are not quite sure why.. So there does seem to be an argument for slowing down and ironing out that teensy wrinkle before moving on to, you know, extinction-level technology.. A generous view of the tech leaders calling for themselves to be leashed is that they are being responsible and that it\u2019s the other irresponsible actors they are worried about. They\u2019d like to do more but, you see, the guys at Google can\u2019t let themselves be beaten by the guys at Microsoft.. So these warnings are an attempt to shake politicians and regulators into action, which is damned sporting of them given that world leaders have such a stellar record of responding cooperatively and intelligently to extinction-level threats.. I mean come on. They\u2019ve mentioned it to the United States Congress. I don\u2019t think we could ask much more. And the British government is now on the case, which would be more reassuring if it wasn\u2019t still struggling to process asylum seekers in less than 18 months.. With luck, the warnings will indeed shock governments into useful action. Maybe this leads to global standards, international agreements and a moratorium on killer developments.. Either way, the AI gurus\u2019 consciences are now clear. They\u2019ve done all they can.. And if one day, around 2025, the machines do indeed gain the power to obliterate us \u2013 sorry, many of us \u2013 I like to think that in the final seconds the AI will ping out a last inquiry to the brilliant minds who knowingly blundered ahead with a technology that could destroy us without at that stage figuring out how to, you know, stop it doing so.. \u201cWhy did you carry on, knowing the risks?\u201d asks SkyNet. And in their final seconds the geniuses reply: \u201cWhat do you mean? We signed a statement.\u201d Financial Times",

    "context": "Wee Jin Sin. The horse racing fraternity has reacted with dismay to the Government\u2019s recent decision to close the Singapore Turf Club (STC) in Kranji.. This will mean the end of the 180-year-old sport in Singapore and the loss of hundreds of jobs. It also leaves horse owners, jockeys and the horses themselves facing an uncertain future.. Despite the sympathy for STC\u2019s employees, the 120ha of land freed up by the club\u2019s closure opens up many possibilities for other urgent land use requirements.. Put simply, one key aim of land use planning is to use any given piece of land to bring the most benefits to the most people.. With local horse racing experiencing declining spectatorship over the years, it makes sense to redevelop the land on which the STC sits to meet urgent housing demand, especially for public housing.. The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has indicated that planning for the site will take two or three years. Beyond the housing, leisure and recreation uses already announced, it is too early to speculate what else might come up on the land.. However, there are hints about how government agencies plan to approach the site.. A spokesman for the URA has noted that Singapore\u2019s northern region as a whole is very \u201cgreen\u201d and that the authority would take the surrounding context into account.. The surrounding physical context includes the Mandai Mangrove and Mudflat Nature Park to the north, and the Kranji Reservoir, Kranji Coastal Nature Park and Kranji Marshes to the north-east and east. The Rail Corridor is also just north of the STC site.. Beyond physical factors, general attitudes towards greenery have evolved over the years.. Indeed, it was reported earlier in June in The Straits Times that a study by the National University of Singapore (NUS) Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions quantified what I had long noticed among my own friends and acquaintances \u2013 that Singaporeans value views of greenery enough to pay a premium for them.. This means we have moved beyond equating greenery only with formal parks or nature areas.. The Rail Corridor, for example, is a green leisure and recreation space for daytime joggers and walkers, but also doubles as a route for cyclists going to work, and a linkway for wildlife connectivity at night.. The Clementi Nature Corridor announced by the National Parks Board in July 2021 as an ecological connection between Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and the Southern Ridges, and the 400ha Sungei Buloh Nature Park Network, are emblematic of the Government\u2019s current science-based approach to managing the balance between nature conservation and development needs.. In that regard, beyond parks and landscaped greenery, there could be an opportunity for incorporating nature corridors in any new town at the STC site to improve the ecological links between existing nature areas around Kranji.. The recent NUS study also noted that the area of greenery per person within residential towns declined from 17.7 sq m to 13.7 sq m from 2008 to 2020. Given the premium we place on it, I believe most Singaporeans would welcome it if we could add to the amount of greenery in Singapore.. According to news reports, URA has not ruled out the possibility of retaining some STC structures if it makes sense to keep or repurpose them for other uses.. Adaptive re-use of existing buildings was in the news recently when The Business Times reported London-based environmental engineer Patrick Bellew and Singapore building experts arguing that in terms of embodied carbon, it is not environmentally sustainable to demolish buildings and rebuild them.. Embodied carbon refers to the greenhouse gases that are released when building materials are made, transported and assembled. According to Mr Bellew, even for \u201csuper green\u201d buildings, embodied carbon constitutes about 80 per cent of the carbon emissions in the first 50 years of a building\u2019s lifespan.. In other words, no matter how environmentally sustainable a building is when operational, a lot of its carbon emissions had already been expended during its construction and early years.. Adaptive re-use of existing buildings would help negate the excessive carbon emissions inherent in the demolish-and-rebuild model.. With the STC now about 25 years old, its buildings are good candidates for adaptive re-use as they are unlikely to be near the end of their structural lifespan.. In fact, there are precedents overseas of sporting stadiums being repurposed for housing and other uses.. One example is the old Highbury stadium, the home of Arsenal Football Club for 93 years until 2006. The stadium was converted into apartments for the new Highbury Square development.. In the American city of Indianapolis, the 80-year-old grandstand of the historic Bush baseball stadium was converted into an apartment complex known as Stadium Lofts, which opened in 2013.. This, of course, does not necessarily mean that a different building, like STC\u2019s grandstand, can be similarly repurposed.. Would retaining the grandstand unacceptably constrain the development potential and spatial planning of the rest of the site? Is the building suitable to be repurposed for the uses being considered, and would the effort be prohibitively expensive or too time-consuming to be practical?. These are tough questions and hard economics, and pragmatism may render adaptive re-use of the grandstand unfeasible.. However, there is value in considering the preservation of the intangible social memory of horse racing\u2019s long history in Singapore once it is gone, and honouring those who were part of it.. If there is scope for adaptive re-use of the grandstand, one can imagine a day in the not-too-distant future when former STC employees or horse trainers could visit the lush and green new town and point out the repurposed grandstand to their children.. Even with their illustrious sport gone, the building would be a meaningful legacy of Singapore\u2019s horse racing heritage, and the glory days of the Kranji racetrack.. \u2022 Wee Jin Sin was an urban planner at the Urban Redevelopment Authority and an airport planner at the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore. He is now pursuing a graduate diploma in counselling psychology.",

    "context": "Woo Jun Jie. Urban redevelopment can come into conflict with preserving heritage. In land-scarce Singapore, it is often inevitable.. But effective urban planning is necessary to ensure that the nation\u2019s land use needs are met. This often requires our urban planners to redevelop existing plots of land to create space for new developments.. What are the key considerations that determine which buildings or sites are to be conserved and which are to be redeveloped? How can our urban planners continue to ensure that Singapore\u2019s land use needs are fulfilled while at the same time retaining our heritage?. This ongoing tension arose again with recent announcements that the Singapore Turf Club would cease its racing operations at Kranji. The 120ha Kranji site will be returned to the Government and redeveloped for housing and other needs.. The move will free up much-needed land to address our urgent needs for more housing and commercial spaces.. Considering the 180-year history of horse racing in Singapore, it is by no means an easy decision. But there are several factors that make this necessary.. Closing the racecourse will support the development of a northern economic hub known as Woodlands Regional Centre, a plan that had already been articulated in the Housing Board\u2019s (HDB) 2017 Remaking Our Heartland programme.. Such efforts to create regional business hubs are also part of the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)\u2019s \u201cLocal Hubs, Global Gateways\u201d strategy which aims to provide more commercial space outside the Central Business District (CBD).. According to real estate consultancy Knight Frank, office rents in the CBD rose in the first quarter of 2023, driven by a combination of tight supply and strong demand.. Singapore is also facing high demand for housing, which has translated into rising home prices and rents. In the first quarter of 2023, private home prices rose by 3.3 per cent while those of resale HDB flats rose by 0.9 per cent.. As the space needs of Singapore\u2019s residents and its industries continue to grow, it will become necessary to redevelop existing sites to build more housing estates, innovation parks, satellite business districts and other projects.. Besides driving urban redevelopment, the URA is also in charge of conserving historically significant buildings. According to the authority, conservation requires an appreciation and understanding of the architecture and structure of historic buildings, with the aim of retaining their inherent spirit and original ambience.. Considerations for whether to conserve a building therefore involve the historical significance of the building, its architectural merit, as well as the original ambience of the building.. The recent gazetting of Golden Mile Complex as a conserved building is a good case in point, given its post-independence modernist Brutalist style of architecture and popularity as a mixed-use development.. However, given Singapore\u2019s land constraints and urgent land-use needs, it will be increasingly difficult to justify the conservation of buildings and facilities that occupy large plots of land.. At 120ha, the Kranji Turf Club is almost four times the size of Dover Forest (33ha) and more than double the size of Keppel Club (48ha). Both of those sites have been slated for redevelopment into housing estates.. While critics of the Dover Forest redevelopment suggested building flats on existing vacant sites, housing estates are in reality developed as an integrated whole.. This means that housing estates need to include not only homes but also transport infrastructure, schools, markets, food outlets and medical facilities, requiring large plots of land rather than random pockets of space.. The impetus for the Turf Club\u2019s closure is also related to a broader decline of interest in horse racing.. According to a report from The Economist, horse racing viewership and attendance have been decreasing rapidly in the United States, pushed by declining interest in the sport as well as the proliferation of alternative gambling venues like casinos.. In Singapore, horse racing average attendance has fallen from 6,000 per day in 2019 to current levels of 2,600 per day.. Beyond its size, a racecourse is also a highly specialised facility that is designed to provide space for the care, training and racing of horses.. At the Singapore Turf Club, there are multiple tracks for different race types and training purposes, racing and resting stables to accommodate horses, and an equine pool for training purposes. There are also a grandstand and carparks for accommodating spectators on race days.. It will not be easy to convert such facilities for residential and commercial uses, nor will it be an optimal use of space and resources.. It is possible that for the same reasons, other countries have considered closure of their horse racing tracks.. In India, there is an ongoing debate about converting Mumbai\u2019s Mahalaxmi Race Course into a central park.. In the United Kingdom, the Folkestone Racecourse in the county of Kent was closed in 2012 and recently approved for redevelopment into Otterpool Park Garden Town. This is a sustainability-focused town development that will provide housing, business premises and recreational facilities.. In both instances, the demolishment (or proposed demolishment) of a racecourse frees up space for building homes and green spaces.. In cases where large sports venues are conserved in the past, these often involved sports that continue to enjoy strong interest and viewership.. Such venues include Berlin\u2019s Olympiastadion, which was a stadium built for the 1936 summer Olympics that is now used for international football matches.. In Athens, there is the Panathenaic Stadium which was built around 330 BC. It has gone through refurbishments over the course of its history and remains in use as an Olympics venue.. Given space constraints, Singapore will often face difficult trade-offs between urban redevelopment and conservation.. This is further complicated by the fact that both are emotionally charged issues that matter a great deal to many.. While it is important to conserve buildings and spaces that hold special meaning or memories for their users, there is also an urgent need to ensure sufficient housing and commercial spaces.. Both are critical for the population.",

    "context": "Gideon Rachman. Both Britain and America flatter themselves that their political systems are admired all over the world. Britain is the home to the \u201cmother of Parliaments\u201d. The United States is the \u201cleader of the free world\u201d. The two countries see themselves as mature democracies; models that other nations can emulate.. But the last few years have shaken that Anglo-American complacency. Britain has suffered the agonies of Brexit and gone through four prime ministers in as many years. The US saw Congress stormed on Jan 6, 2021, in what was essentially an attempted coup by an outgoing president.. The troubles of democracy have deep roots in both countries. But they are also closely associated with two individuals \u2013 Donald Trump and Mr Boris Johnson.. Trump and Mr Johnson have championed a similar style of politics. Both have built up cults of personality, convincing their most devoted followers that they are men of destiny. Both are nostalgic nationalists, who have promised to restore their country\u2019s greatness. Both claim to be representatives of the people against a self-interested elite.. Because they regard themselves as unique, indispensable figures, Mr Johnson and Trump have felt free to break the laws and conventions that normally bind political leaders. When challenged or held to account, both have claimed to be the victims of a deep state conspiracy.. This is a style of politics that is well known all over the world. The charismatic strongman leader \u2013 paranoid, power hungry, unaccountable and surrounded by sycophants \u2013 is a sadly familiar figure. Just look at the ranting speeches of Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who claims to see conspiracies against him everywhere.. For Mr Erdogan, the law is a weapon to be used against his political opponents, rather than something that he himself must obey. The same is true for Mr Vladimir Putin in Russia. In Turkey and Russia alike, the president\u2019s political opponents frequently end up in prison, while the leaders themselves are never held to account, despite the accusations of corruption and abuse of power that swirl around them.. It is these questions of the rule of law and accountability that are central to the latest episodes of the Trump and Johnson soap operas.. The former US president has just been indicted for mishandling classified documents. The former British prime minister has just resigned from the House of Commons after a committee accused him of lying to Parliament about breaking the law during the Covid-19 pandemic.. The reactions of Trump and Mr Johnson to their current travails are strikingly similar. They have followed the same paranoid and self-interested narrative, claiming that they are the victims of a political conspiracy and that the system is rigged against them and their followers.. Such assertions strike at the heart of the US and British images of themselves as mature democracies in which the rule of law is not a charade but a reality. The bleak suggestion is that governance in Washington and London is little different from Moscow or Ankara.. Both Trump and Mr Johnson are fabulists for whom the truth is simply what is politically or personally convenient at the time. That style of politics is becoming more common and threatening. We live in a social media age in which \u201calternative facts\u201d (in the words of a former Trump aide) can always be concocted, if the real facts prove inconvenient.. Any functioning, law-governed democracy must be based on the idea that there is such a thing as truth and that it can be established in a court or by a parliamentary committee. Crucially, that is very different from saying that Trump or Mr Johnson must be found guilty. They have every right to protest their innocence. If either could prove it before a court of law or a parliamentary committee, that would be just as much a sign of democracy in action as a guilty verdict.. The courts, political parties and the voters all have a role to play in making sure that the rule of law and democracy function properly. Here, the outlook looks more promising in Britain than in the US.. The parliamentary committee that found against Mr Johnson contains a majority of members of his own party. By contrast, very few Republicans in Congress have turned against Trump, whatever their private misgivings. The judge who will rule on the latest Trump indictment in Florida was appointed by the former president. She, too, must be seen to behave impartially.. If the courts do their job in an obviously fair and professional manner, it is more likely that their verdicts will command the respect of voters. A majority of voters, like the courts, also have to be able to resist conspiracy theories and \u201calternative\u201d facts. That seems far from a sure thing in the US, where Trump remains the favourite for the Republican nomination and is neck and neck with President Joe Biden in the polls for an election.. The cases of Trump and Mr Johnson will matter far beyond the shores of the US and Britain. If they are properly handled, it will send a vital message to people battling autocracies all over the world. America and Britain need to show that it really is possible to have a system in which political leaders are held to account \u2013 and where the rule of law is a reality, not a myth.

    "context": "Peter Hodges. June 2023 marks the 30th anniversary of a film that changed cinema forever. 1993\u2019s Jurassic Park used pioneering computer-generated imagery (CGI) to bring dinosaurs to life in director Steven Spielberg\u2019s adaptation of the novel of the same name.. The film quickly became a must-see event, and audiences were left amazed by the spectacle of seeing believable dinosaurs grace the big screen for the first time. Jurassic Park not only made giant leaps in special-effects film-making, but it also paved the way for myriad subsequent productions that featured beasts of all shapes and sizes.. Jurassic Park originated in 1983 as a screenplay by author Michael Crichton, whose previous foray into film as writer and director of Westworld (1973) featured an immersive amusement park where androids malfunctioned and caused havoc. But his dinosaur-themed story first found publication as the novel Jurassic Park, which was released in 1990 and became a bestseller.. That\u2019s when it came to the attention of Spielberg. By the early 1990s, Spielberg was no stranger to big-budget science-fiction film-making. The likes of Jaws (1975), Close Encounters Of The Third Kind (1977), Raiders Of The Lost Ark (1981) and E. T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982) had demonstrated that he had a track record of making extremely successful effects-heavy but story-led films. That made Jurassic Park perfect for his next production.. Spielberg\u2019s adaptation, written by Crichton and David Koepp, changed a number of aspects of the novel\u2019s ending to provide a satisfactory conclusion to the film, yet leave enough loose ends for further exploration in the franchise.. Of course, Jurassic Park wasn\u2019t the first time dinosaurs had been featured on the big screen. 1933\u2019s King Kong is an early example of a film that pushed the boundaries of what was then possible by including sequences of the eponymous giant gorilla fighting with dinosaurs.. Creatures were brought to life for cinemagoers by combining stop-motion animation with rear projection (where previously shot film is projected onto a backdrop and actors are recorded performing in front of it). Other feature films such as Journey To The Centre Of The Earth (1959), The Lost World (1960) and The Land That Time Forgot (1974) had attempted alternative ways of bringing dinosaurs to the screen, including puppetry and even fitting live reptiles with prosthetics.. Of these methods, a combination of stop-motion animation for long shots and animatronic puppets for close-ups was initially chosen by Spielberg for Jurassic Park.. Stop-motion tests produced good results, especially in the development of go-motion, a technique which blurred models to provide a sense of movement similar to that of live action.. But Spielberg and his team were still keen to go further with what was possible. Dennis Muren from visual effects company Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) provided an alternative approach by using CGI modelling and animation.. Off the back of pioneering CGI work in The Abyss (1989) and Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991), Muren and his team produced a test sequence of skeletal dinosaurs. Additional tests featuring a Tyrannosaurus rex with added skin further cemented the realisation that this was the way to go for the film. This technique built the model of the dinosaur from bones, added muscle and then, finally, the skin.. It seemed the assembled stop-motion team had been made extinct by this innovative technology. However, the model-makers and animators were the experts on dinosaurs and their movement, and they retrained as computer animators to continue to use their skills on the production.. Jurassic Park features 15 minutes of on-screen dinosaurs, of which approximately nine minutes feature Stan Winston\u2019s animatronics and six minutes feature ILM\u2019s CGI animation. The success of this combination is seen in the iconic T. rex attack scene. A number of animatronic shots feature close-ups of the T. rex before the full-height shots provide the creature\u2019s threat and power.. How Spielberg orchestrates the scene, from the atmospheric, tension building of the rainstorm, through the initial reveal and reactions, the prolonged attack and subsequent escape, takes the audience through a range of emotions. Although the CGI sections are relatively short, they have a huge impact on the overall storytelling, not to mention the believability that the event is actually happening in front of us. It\u2019s a true representation of the power of cinema.. On release, Jurassic Park became an instant box office success, becoming the highest-grossing film ever at that time.. It also presented the perfect opportunity to develop and showcase the latest advances in CGI. The thrill of seeing the stampede of Gallimimus, the horror of the T. rex attack and the suspense of the Velociraptor hunt captivated audiences across the globe.. Jurassic Park inspired a number of similarly themed movies, such as Disney\u2019s Dinosaur (2000) and the award-winning BBC television series Walking with Dinosaurs (1999). But more than that, it helped bring about a revolution in the use of CGI in film-making.. From those six minutes of animated dinosaurs, CGI has become so integrated into the industry to the extent that nearly all film and television productions feature some form of CGI practice. This can simply mean digitally cleaning up aspects of the filmed image with removals and replacements, set extensions, adding CGI set models or animated vehicles and props, to filming with green screen and compositing images, or merging actors within full CGI environments.. The film remains a significant point in the history of cinema that successfully announced that CGI creatures had arrived, paving the way for the following 30 years of fantasy film-making.",

    "context": "The return of 120ha of land, occupied by the Singapore Turf Club (STC) since 1999, to the Government by March 2027 marks the end of more than 180 years of horse racing in Singapore. Local racing operations at Kranji will cease in 2024, with the last event scheduled for Oct 5, coinciding with the 100th Grand Singapore Gold Cup. Racing enthusiasts naturally bemoan the passing of an era in which the club, founded under a different name in 1842, saw the inaugural Singapore Cup race being held in 1843 and the first run of the Singapore Derby in 1880. The Bukit Timah Racecourse, built in 1933, would come to be regarded as the finest in the East. Local turf history was made in 1981 when two Australians became the first women granted permits to ride. In between and after such milestones, the club has served as a place not only for punters to come together to witness the drama of money to be made (or lost) from the competitive display of equestrian skills, but also as a companionable arena in which to socialise with the fellow-minded.. Sadly, horse racing has witnessed dwindling spectatorship over the years. Now, the last race is about to be run. Yet, the greater reason for the STC\u2019s closure lies in the compulsions of land-use planning in Singapore. The Government is obliged to review its land-use plans continually to meet today\u2019s needs, while ensuring that there is sufficient land for future generations. The redevelopment of the Singapore Racecourse site would allow for the land and its surroundings to be transformed to meet future land-use needs better. Building housing at the site would support the development of Woodlands Regional Centre as Singapore\u2019s largest northern economic hub. Other major plans include redeveloping the Woodlands Checkpoint, enhancing Woodlands Town, and turning Lim Chu Kang into a high-tech agri-food cluster. Yet other potential uses include leisure and recreation.. Also, given that the closure of the club would not have a significant impact on government finances, the authorities need to optimise the value of the racecourse as a national resource in the interests of all Singaporeans, not just the equestrian and punting communities. Public policy decisions are never easy, particularly when they involve weighing legitimate social sentiments against pressing economic imperatives. Golf, another land-intensive sport, has seen several clubs come under the unsentimental gaze of land-use planning. There is no denying the nostalgia associated with historical places of sports. It attests to the necessary importance that Singaporeans place on known ways of life. However, a land-scarce island city-state needs to remain economically sustainable. This is an overarching objective that occasionally calls for drastic changes to the social landscape.",

    "context": "Gillian Tett. Three weeks ago, the United States Treasury announced the launch of a new oversight committee called the Cloud Executive Steering Group.. It received almost no public attention. No wonder: Compared with the explosive controversies around cryptocurrencies, ChatGPT or Europe\u2019s new drive to break up Google\u2019s dominance of adtech, cloud computing \u2013 the public and private data storage and processing platforms run by Big Tech vendors \u2013 sounds achingly dull. So much so, that most Americans view Amazon as \u201cjust\u201d an online retail giant, even though its cloud division now generates significant revenues.. But investors and financial services consumers alike should wake up. For, as a report from the Treasury\u2019s little-known Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee (FBIIC) declared earlier in 2023, regulators are getting nervous about the systemic financial risks emanating from the cloud. Indeed, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) suggested in 2022 \u2013 echoing work by European central banks \u2013 that \u201cbig tech interdependencies\u201d have become \u201ca key policy blind spot\u201d.. Thus, the crucial question for the Treasury\u2019s cloud committee \u2013 which includes both regulators and bankers such as PNC Financial Services chief executive Bill Demchak \u2013 is whether this \u201cblind spot\u201d can be corrected before a not-so-boring accident erupts.. There are at least three big issues to consider. The first is the speed of change in computing practices. The FBIIC report notes that more than 90 per cent of the members of the American Bankers Association are shifting activity on to the cloud, although more than 80 per cent say this is at an early stage. Since a separate survey suggests that two-thirds of banks expect at least 30 per cent of their activities to be cloud-based in the next three years, the FBIIC calculates that cloud usage will triple by then. The pattern in Europe seems similar.. Second, financial regulators are ill-equipped to handle this explosive growth. They have always struggled to track information technology, since they have historically hired economists, not techies. But when finance companies were running their own IT operations, regulators did at least have a mandate to watch them.. However, the dash into the cloud places more of that activity in the hands of Big Tech vendors, who have never faced serious central bank scrutiny before. Some observers, such as BIS head Agustin Carstens, think that an overhaul is overdue, in order to extend the \u201cregulatory perimeter\u201d. Maybe so.. But America\u2019s tech giants will fiercely resist efforts to put them under the purview of central banks or other financial regulators \u2013 and the White House currently shows little stomach for that battle. That leaves the cloud in a financial regulatory grey zone. \u201cDue to the different legal authorities for each agency, no single agency can see across the many use cases and the network of dependencies on cloud services within the financial sector,\u201d the FBIIC report observed. In plain English: This is a fog.. Third, insofar as data is available, it seems that there are big, and growing, concentration risks. This might sound surprising. After all, one reason for financial groups to dash into the cloud is to reduce their reliance on costly, and potentially vulnerable, in-house data centres. A distributed model is supposed to be more resilient.. But one bitter irony of finance is that innovations which purport to reduce risk by distributing it can sometimes also concentrate it in new, surprising and half-hidden ways. Consider credit. Before 2008, it was assumed that innovations such as securitised mortgage products would promote resilience by spreading default risk beyond banks.. But when the 2008 crisis hit, it emerged that numerous players had quietly hedged their activities with the same entity \u2013 AIG Financial Products (AIGFP). That created a hidden \u201csingle point of failure\u201d, or Spof, to use an engineering term, and generated shocks when AIGFP wobbled.. Cloud computing echoes this so-called Spof issue, as Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu told the BIS earlier in 2023. Most notably \u2013 and as Brussels often complains \u2013 the cloud is dominated by an oligopoly of Amazon, Microsoft and Google. If one of those players suffered a big cyber attack, weather-linked disruption or simply went bankrupt, that would rock the system.. Big Tech executives insist this will not occur. You would hope so. And these huge companies are almost certainly better at handling cyber risks than banks\u2019 in-house teams. But the 2020 SolarWinds hack on Microsoft\u2019s cloud systems showed that nobody is infallible. So did the recent Ion saga and Capita data breach.. And even without cyber risks, the commercial power wielded by this oligopoly is unnerving, particularly for Europeans. Indeed, Britain\u2019s Office of Communications, or Ofcom, has launched an investigation.. So all eyes are now on the Treasury\u2019s Cloud Committee. Sadly, there are no easy solutions; or not unless the US government does something it seems unwilling or unable to contemplate \u2013 namely, break up Big Tech and/or impose tight government controls. But if nothing else, the issue shows that artificial intelligence is not the only tech topic that matters now. Maybe that Cloud Committee should ask ChatGPT how to defuse the Spof threat. The answer would probably be easier for Big Tech to swallow than asking Brussels. FINANCIAL TIMES",

    "context": "As I head into my mid-50s, one of my fears of ageing is that I will be increasingly marginalised, and eventually rendered invisible, as I get older.. After all, when one\u2019s career slows and then stops, one loses status and significance. As one\u2019s health declines, one is gradually robbed of autonomy. It is not far a slide from there to a frail old age dependent on others. And then one day, I may be a patient in a nursing home, calling in vain for a nursing aide to get me a bedpan, and if she is slow, I may soil my bed; or, shudders, I might be deemed a \u201cdifficult\u201d patient who needs to be physically restrained in bed.. My mind also goes to those who live by themselves, who may die alone, their bodies undiscovered for days. Such are the deep-seated fears of ageing many of us in Singapore have.. My fears of ageing coalesced when I watched the recently released National Day Parade song. Titled Shine Your Light, it is upbeat and has a youthful vibe. When I watched it the first few times, I could only see what was not there \u2013 scanning the lead singers and dancers, I wondered, where were the older faces?. I felt marginalised as an older Singaporean. It wasn\u2019t until a colleague pointed them out, that I spotted the older faces.. The fear of being made invisible struck home vividly, in a different way, when I was showing a friend from Australia around Singapore. As we went around my estate, and to nearby hawker centres and the beach at East Coast, my friend would have a friendly word of greeting to those we met, especially the security guards, the cleaners and the landscape workers.. Australian society is generally quite egalitarian, and my friend is a convivial person. But I noticed something odd \u2013 few workers returned the greeting, because they were mostly looking down, or away. One was so wrapped up in his own world, he didn\u2019t even realise someone was saying \u201chello\u201d to him.. It struck me that having become so used to being ignored by people around them, they were unused to being greeted in a friendly manner. I also reflected with a sense of embarrassment that I would seldom give a second glance to these workers, especially those in my estate. When my friend suggested offering drinks to the workers who tended to the grounds near my apartment, I said, please don\u2019t.. I realised that while I think of myself as being a sociable and kind person, and I enjoy interacting with Singaporean workers such as hawkers (my late parents were hawkers), those warm feelings did not extend to the migrant workers in our midst. And the closer they work to my home, the greater my discomfort at extending normal social courtesies to them. I prefer to maintain a social distance, and to remain an anonymous resident, not the friendly one who offered them drinks.. In Singapore, many of us have become used to ignoring the workers in our midst who toil for our safety or comfort. Covid-19 helped soften our hearts, but I don\u2019t think the effect was long-lasting.. Psychology research has a lot to say about what happens when people feel ignored or shunned. The pain of social exclusion is experienced in the brain in the same way that physical pain is felt \u2013 in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex \u2013 a brain region associated with the emotional aspects of physical pain.. Using group computer games, various researchers found that even short periods of being ostracised can have lingering effects on feelings, and ultimately affect behaviour, regardless of personality type. Being given the silent treatment, or being bullied, can thus have deep effects on people.. Even being ostracised or ignored by strangers is experienced as hurtful, something we can all attest to \u2013 just recall how it felt when someone suddenly left their seat when we sat next to them; or crossed the road when we approached.. Psychologists theorise that social exclusion is so painful because it is experienced as a threat to safety: human beings are social creatures with hardwired needs for safety, a sense of belonging and self-esteem. These needs are threatened when we are ignored, or shunned, or made to feel invisible. The worst would be to feel erased, as though we had no right to exist. In social animals, being left out of a group can literally be a death sentence, as they are left to fend for themselves against predators.. \u201cBeing excluded or ostracised is an invisible form of bullying that doesn\u2019t leave bruises, and therefore we often underestimate its impact,\u201d said professor of psychological sciences Kipling D. Williams of Purdue University who researches social ostracisation. \u201cBeing excluded by high school friends, office colleagues, or even spouses or family members can be excruciating.\u201d. When someone is ostracised, they go through three stages of response. First is the experience of being ignored or shunned, which leads to feelings of rejection. The next stage is coping, when people adapt behaviours to try to fit in, such as trying to please the group. If this doesn\u2019t work, they may give up trying to fit in and resort to being noticed, by disruptive or aggressive behaviours. If the shunning is prolonged, the person eventually gives up. Feelings of anger and sadness may linger even if the person becomes resigned to the situation. As Prof Williams said: \u201cLong-term ostracism can result in alienation, depression, helplessness, and feelings of unworthiness.\u201d. I had felt the sting of feeling invisible as an older Singaporean in response to an upbeat music video that appeared targeted at the younger generation; but in my everyday life, I am one of those whose behaviour slaps on a cloak of invisibility on others around me.. If it hurt, even a little, to feel ignored by a national song, what would it feel like for migrant workers, or those in menial jobs, or the isolated elderly, who are ignored and shunned by those around them every day? For me, it was a momentary twinge, but what if invisibility and loneliness for these groups were a constant ache amid the bustle in a country as prosperous as Singapore?",

    "context": "Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam\u2019s announcement of his intention to run for president in the upcoming election could ignite Singaporeans\u2019 enthusiasm for the elected presidency.. With incumbent President Halimah Yacob not seeking re-election, Mr Tharman said in a letter to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Thursday that he decided to put himself forward as a candidate.. The decision had been taken after consultation with his family and in response to requests from Singaporeans from all walks of life, he said.. A candidate with the expertise, experience and standing of Mr Tharman will have much to offer to Singapore\u2019s intra-executive branch system of checks and balances.. Having been finance minister, he is well versed in domestic and international fiscal, monetary and economic matters.. This means he is more than equipped to give the Government advice on such matters, as well as to keep it on its toes on matters that the president exercises custodial powers over, such as key public sector appointments and use of national reserves.. For all of Mr Tharman\u2019s formidable qualities, a contest for the presidency should not be ruled out at this stage.. Even though he is resigning from the Cabinet, given his ties to the ruling People\u2019s Action Party (PAP), Mr Tharman\u2019s candidacy might inspire hopefuls from the private sector who believe that they are equal to the task of being president and are able to gain the support of voters who prefer a non-establishment candidate.. Potential rivals might also hope to leverage the argument for having a contest this round. Out of five presidential elections since 1993, only two were contested (in 1993 and 2011). The act of casting a ballot is significant for democratic choice and for candidates to gain a fair hearing.. As a Nominated Member of Parliament between 2012 and 2014, I had the opportunity to observe close-up Mr Tharman in action in Parliament. In fielding parliamentary questions, he was scrupulously respectful of parliamentarians from across the aisle.. He always endeavoured to answer queries without seeking partisan advantage. During debates on his Budget statements, he was also very persuasive with his erudite arguments and patient explanations in the face of MPs\u2019 calls for the Government to do more, to spend more, and to tax less.. He never talked down to his parliamentary colleagues, especially the opposition.. His people\u2019s touch and connection with the ground are well known.. In addition to his Meet-the-People Sessions, his constituents know where to find him on weekends when he is in his constituency.. Mr Tharman also has a reputation of being independent-minded, even as a senior Cabinet member.. In making the case for a broader meritocracy, \u201ca meritocracy through life\u201d, and of our social safety net as a \u201ctrampoline\u201d, his take was aligned with the Government\u2019s fundamental premise. But in offering refreshing insights of how policies could \u2013 and have, in fact \u2013 evolved, he was able to nudge innovation to keep longstanding policies fit for purpose.. That independence of mind was noted by PM Lee in his letter to Mr Tharman on Thursday. This trait could be seen in Mr Tharman\u2019s calls for critical analysis and objective self-examination.. For example, commenting on his party\u2019s performance in the 2020 General Election, when the PAP lost two group representation constituencies (GRCs) and saw a significant vote shift against it, Mr Tharman wrote in a Facebook post that the results were good for the PAP: \u201cFirst, it secured a solid mandate. Trust in the PAP to run the government and do what is best for Singaporeans is intact. Second, the swing in votes (though from an unrepeatable high in 2015) is leading the party to review its own game so as to win the hearts, and not just the minds, of a changing electorate.. \u201cThe results were also good for opposition politics \u2013 and not merely because they won more votes collectively. The stronger vote for the WP (Workers\u2019 Party) than others, with its more reasonable brand and eschewing of campaigning around a single political figure, reflected a discerning public and a political culture that bodes well for Singapore...\u201d. PM Lee correctly noted that Mr Tharman\u2019s imminent departure from the Cabinet and the PAP would be a \u201cheavy loss\u201d.. There will be massive shoes to fill in his Jurong GRC, which has always been among the party\u2019s best-performing constituencies.. The PAP will lose a heavyweight popular politician with mass appeal, especially among swing voters who desire a PAP that can score points not just through the sheer logic of its effective policies, but through winning hearts as well.. Outside of Singapore, Mr Tharman is well known in financial and economic circles, and is much sought after to serve on international panels such as the International Monetary and Financial Committee.. If he serves as president, and as the chief ambassador of our nation, we can expect the views and concerns of Singapore to be prominently articulated and carefully considered by the international community.. There is another potential plus point for Mr Tharman\u2019s candidacy. If there is a contest and he wins, the result would lay to rest the conventional view that an ethnic Chinese male candidate will have a firm electoral edge over a minority candidate.. Mr Tharman is one of few politicians who have transcended political and racial lines and can show the way forward as our multiracialism matures. This is his signature appeal and it would add to the presidency as the symbol of national unity. This role of the president should not be understated at a time of geopolitical uncertainty and more contested politics domestically.. Each president brings unique qualities to the office and they have reshaped, within the established constitutional strictures, how the presidency remains relevant to Singapore\u2019s system of government and governance and to the people as well.. Mr Tharman\u2019s intent to seek election as president offers the promise of Singaporeans refining and adapting the presidency in tandem with the times and changing aspirations.. If elected, his presidency will be an overall gain for the country.",

    "context": "The National Youth Council is encouraging more young Singaporeans to take the opportunity to travel abroad following the reopening of international borders after the coronavirus pandemic. More than 20 per cent of the 7,000 regional opportunities to go abroad in 2023 have been availed of so far, with the rest scheduled for the second half of the year. This figure is up from 4,800 in 2019. Travel opportunities to South-east Asia, China and India offered by the council\u2019s programmes highlight the importance of Asia in the mental landscape of young Singaporeans.. As a global city, Singapore has been keenly interested in developing its economic connections with the world lying outside its immediate hinterland. This approach was necessary particularly when the Republic\u2019s departure from Malaysia required it to find sources of investment and to reach markets that would reduce its dependence on a traditional economic partner that had turned hostile towards it once it became independent. Singapore\u2019s consequent closeness to North America and Europe resulted in its citizens developing, quite naturally, a Western-centric view of their economic place in the world. The young imbibed attitudes inherited from the experiences and expectations of their parents.. However, the end of the Cold War and the rise of Asia have overturned many global calculations for quite a while. Now, what is required is the ability of the young here to see, understand and accept their neighbours without the use of what an eminent Singaporean educationist calls a \u201cdistorted deficit lens\u201d. That is, even Singapore\u2019s unquestionable success as a city-state should not produce myopic insularity among its young and a resulting sense of regional countries as laggards which need help and support. Such stereotypes belong to a vanished past. The economic successes of China and India should alert Singapore\u2019s tertiary students to the possibilities of South-east Asia as well. Vietnam and Indonesia are among the rising stars of this region. To know them would be to understand what Singapore should do to position itself well in the Asian future, without which globalisation would be hobbled, to the detriment of Singapore ultimately.. Tertiary students here should venture out of their comfort zone to discover and explore their neighbours, less to see how they might or might not fit into Singapore\u2019s formula for survival and success, and more to seek insights into how this country could be a part of Asia\u2019s evolving developmental paradigms. It is not that the Singapore Model is wrong: it is that it needs to keep pace with ways of life, thinking and choice in Asia that are influencing the direction of globalisation.

    "context": "When part of my bathroom ceiling collapsed last year, I took it as a sign that I finally have to renovate my home in a big way. I made the preparations, but then decided to wait for painfully high rents for potential alternative accommodation to go down.. As the waiting stretched into many months, I was surprised by how I got used to the ceiling hole and the exposed pipes. I almost became fond of the \u201cextreme industrial look\u201d. And in doing so, it also struck me that sometimes putting up with milder home imperfections for a while could be a more sustainable way of living.. Don\u2019t get me wrong. Like I said, the high rents stayed my hand. I also know that leaks need to be stopped immediately and damaged ceilings \u2013 even the one that I\u2019m fond of \u2013 eventually need to be replaced.. I would have got someone to fix the leak that led to the ceiling collapse, but I fell ill and chose to self-isolate and repeatedly postponed the plumber appointment as I did not want to put his health at risk.. By then, I was stuck with the collapsed ceiling.. But this has also got me thinking \u2013 and reading up \u2013 on the subject of renovation, particularly about redecorating often as a lifestyle choice.. It\u2019s established that building construction spews a lot of greenhouse gases. The built environment accounts for 39 per cent of gross annual carbon emissions worldwide, according to the United Nations Environment Programme; and in Singapore, the building and construction sector produces over 20 per cent of the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, said a 2022 Straits Times report. But maybe we don\u2019t think enough about renovations as a hefty contributor too.. Observers don\u2019t think the carbon impact of buildings\u2019 interiors is getting enough attention. Buildings.com reported that, according to recent research by LMN Architects in the United States, the carbon footprint of interior design may be bigger than anyone realised.. \u201cIn spaces that undergo cyclical renovations, the cumulative carbon impact of interiors can actually surpass the emissions generated by building the structure and envelope,\u201d it said. \u201cThe structure and envelope are only built once unless you\u2019re constructing an addition, but interiors change relatively frequently.\u201d. This is food for thought as Singapore pushes towards a target of net-zero emissions by 2050.. Think about the square footage of your home, then consider how much waste a renovation generates when you look at these figures from the US: The average residential renovation produces more than 10kg of waste per square foot, according to a study by the country\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency. So renovating just a 100-square-foot area could generate more than one tonne of debris like tiles, wood and more.. There\u2019s no way we can avoid producing waste, of course, when we have to make repairs, and improve homes in terms of indoor air quality, energy efficiency and so on. Living well and enjoying our homes are top priorities.. But if there\u2019s no pressing need, and renovations are more of a lifestyle choice \u2013 like buying tonnes of clothes for fashionable fun \u2013 maybe homeowners can slow things down, and take the time to consider reusing some interior elements.. It may be surprising what we can live with if we slow down the rush to renovate and replace.. I love scrolling through inspirational interior decoration online pictures, so I surprised myself by not having done a renovation or two on my home of over a decade.. And given my love of home appliances, I\u2019m also tickled that I am still using the fridge (and even all the curtains) of the previous owner of my home. I also used his washing machine and air-conditioner for years until they gave up the ghost.. Save some money and save the earth at the same time.. These are personal decisions homeowners can make while we wait to see if the structured reuse of and end-of-life green strategies for materials will become more mainstream in the renovation industry.. Well, at least, I am hoping for such structured nudges to arrive one day so I can make better decisions if I ever get to start on my first-ever full-scale renovation.. Look, for example, at how consumers can be nudged by green loans.. These loans promise preferential interest rates, rebates and shopping vouchers for eligible consumers who fulfil some pre-set criteria.. To qualify for the green renovation loans, homes must have energy-efficient features such as LED lighting, smart devices to turn off appliances remotely when not in use, and so on.. Banks in Singapore say there is growing interest among consumers to take up green financing solutions. Ninety per cent of DBS\u2019 renovation loan customers are now on a green loan, according to a March 2023 ST report. Other banks with various green loan offers include OCBC.. It\u2019s easier to make better decisions if there\u2019s a menu of green options laid before you. This is because, believe me, I am fully ready to be tempted into replacing everything.. I think that after using the previous owner\u2019s fridge, washing machine, TV, all of his interior fixtures and cabinets for over 10 years \u2013 and living with a ceiling hole as well as bathing with a bucket for months \u2013 it is finally time to renovate and replace it all. In a green way.",

    "context": "Frederick Lim. I never got to know my father well. He died suddenly when I was nine. He was only 44.. Although I didn\u2019t have much time with him, I have fond memories of my boyhood days. And on Father\u2019s Day every year, I look at his photograph, say a little prayer for him, and thank him for all that he gave me during our brief time together.. I grew up in Klang, a city in Selangor in Malaysia, where my father worked as a civil servant. After his death, my mother, older brother and I moved to Singapore where my uncle gave us a place to live. We lived modestly, with my father\u2019s government pension and financial help from my uncle. There was no money for extras.. It was the absence of my father that marked my days back then. I missed how he doted on my brother and me, how he came home with presents and took us out to the movies. Most of all, I missed how he answered all our endless questions, which came easy for him as he had encyclopaedic knowledge.. What I remember most are the lessons he taught me that have guided me throughout my growing-up years and shaped my personality.. As a young boy, I took my father\u2019s words as gospel truth and the advice he gave as gold, holding them close to my heart.. The biggest lesson has to be the \u201c272-steps lesson\u201d.. When I was around six years old, our family visited the Batu Caves Hindu temple near Kuala Lumpur. The mouth of Batu Caves was at the top of numerous and steep steps. When my father said there were 272 steps, I told him I would not make it all the way to the top.. His reply gave me the motivation to go for it: Getting to the top was just a matter of taking 16 steps to reach a landing, then another 16 steps to get to the next one, and if I kept going from one landing to another, I would reach the caves.. And so we climbed \u2013 my father holding my hand and both of us counting the steps out loud until we reached the caves.. The lesson learnt: Don\u2019t be daunted by a big problem, as it can be tackled by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts.. I applied this lesson throughout my life \u2013 breaking a task into smaller steps, stages and sequences to eventually get it done. This approach to problem-solving has stood me in good stead in my personal and professional life.. When I was 45, I made a mid-career switch from stockbroking to journalism, joining CNA as a business reporter. As I knew little about TV production, I applied what my father taught me \u2013 do things in steps, stages and sequences. In time, with training and learning on the job, I became a senior editor of the station\u2019s business programme.. Another lesson I learnt from my father was foundation-building. I remember as a child stacking building blocks, putting a square or round piece on top of another to see how high I could build the tower before the whole structure came crashing down.. My first few attempts collapsed in double-quick time. After seeing my failed attempts, my father showed me how I needed to build a strong foundation in order to get taller towers. I should not rush it, and take care to align the pieces to get a more stable structure.. I followed his advice, and my towers stood tall and did not collapse.. Building strong foundations became an integral part of everything I did in life. I was always well prepared before an examination, I trained hard before running a marathon, and I researched extensively before covering a news event.. My father also made sure he built a strong foundation in the education of his two sons. When we turned three, he introduced us to the alphabet, taught us numbers and read books to us to build up our vocabulary. He made us do simple sums and memorise the multiplication table.. On our family trips to other towns in Malaysia, my father would make us solve mental maths problems. To keep us occupied during the long drives, he asked us to work out how long it would take to get to the destination based on the speed of the car and the distance left to go.. There were also memory games, such as naming the capital cities of countries and the dates of historical events.. We went to the library regularly to borrow books, and he bought junior encyclopaedias to help us improve our general knowledge. He helped us with homework and reminded us to always go beyond what we learnt in school.. I grew up loving books and studied English literature in school. I developed a passion for writing and published two novels.. My father was a kind-hearted and generous man. He gave to charities readily and lent money to his cash-strapped colleagues. Our barber, who needed money for his family in India, borrowed from my father, who never asked for the loan to be repaid.. He talked to us about faith, and most importantly, showed us through his actions the importance of living life with honesty and integrity.. He told me never to take what was not mine at times when I found things. When I was a Scout in school, he reminded me during Job Week that I should do my best, as I was getting paid for the work. He told me he always gave his all, for the organisations he worked in and the people he worked with.. Of course, my father had his weaknesses. He loved food too much, often overate and rarely exercised. As he was only in his 40s when he died from typhoid fever, I have always wondered if he could have recovered from the bacterial infection if he had taken better care of his health.. My father could also be indecisive and lacked composure. I remember an incident when a beehive at the back of our house fell to the ground, and my father ran for cover from the swarm of bees. My mother\u2019s quick thinking in setting the hive on fire saved the day.. Despite his shortcomings and his brief time with us, he had a lasting impact on our lives. I would like to think that he had a hand in the success story of my brother, who rose through the ranks to become a rear-admiral in the Singapore Navy and was Chief of Navy before he retired.. Although I do not have children of my own, I do have advice for all the fathers out there \u2013 teach your children well, as what you say will leave an indelible impression and stay with them for the rest of their lives. Just like how my father\u2019s words and wise counsel have guided me through mine.. So this Father\u2019s Day, I will gaze upon the photo of my dad, and thank him for making me who I am today.",

    "context": "Jemima Kelly. I couldn\u2019t go into the office last Tuesday. The finale of what I consider to be the greatest TV show of the last decade, Succession, had aired the previous day, and I hadn\u2019t yet watched it. The risk of hearing spoilers from my colleagues was unacceptably high.. So I embarked on a comprehensive spoiler-shielding programme: I stayed at home, muted a particularly telly-focused WhatsApp group, and avoided social media. Or I tried to, anyway.. In the end, it was my addiction to the latter that proved my downfall: in a moment of distraction, my thumb found its way to the Twitter app, and there it was, right in front of me: a tweet containing a giant spoiler.. Some might argue that I should have just watched the 90-minute episode when it aired \u2013 which was 2am in London \u2013 or at least as soon after that as possible (I would counter that I had other, more important things to do). They might also lament my inability to avoid social media, where TV series are often discussed (I have since installed a Twitter-blocking app, which is remarkably effective).. But what is the correct etiquette when it comes to sharing spoilers? Surely we don\u2019t have to watch every show we love as soon as it comes out. And what of the \u201cspoilees\u201d: those who actively share plot details because they feel part of a cultural moment and want to signal that they are au courant?. I ran a (somewhat unscientific) Twitter poll this week to get other people\u2019s thoughts. The results were quite clear: of 478 votes, the biggest group \u2013 just over 33 per cent \u2013 felt spoilers shouldn\u2019t be shared until at least a week after a show has aired, if ever. Almost as many said a few days to a week was the right amount of time. Only 22 per cent thought it was acceptable to share spoilers immediately, as the LA Times did earlier in the series, publishing a faux-obituary for a certain key character minutes after Succession had aired.. It\u2019s not just TV shows that can be spoiled. Unless an author has himself written a spoiler into a story (like Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cstar-cross\u2019d lovers\u201d, whose fate we are told in the prologue of Romeo and Juliet), I don\u2019t want any clues as to what might happen in plays or novels, either. And there is sometimes fun to be had by not revealing an ending, as audiences of Agatha Christie\u2019s The Mousetrap, the longest-running play in history, have largely managed since 1952.. But is our spoilerphobia warranted? Perhaps not. A study published in 2011 by two psychologists at the University of California, San Diego, found that spoilers not only do not ruin the enjoyment of stories; they actually increase it. Participants were given three short stories each to read, from three different genres \u2013 mystery, literary and \u201cironic-twist\u201d. One of these stories had a \u201cspoiler\u201d paragraph at the start, in which the plot was discussed, and the ending revealed in a way that seemed inadvertent. In all three categories, readers enjoyed these \u201cspoiled\u201d versions more.. \u201cWhat people liked was a better understanding of the story,\u201d Mr Jon Leavitt, one of the study\u2019s authors, tells me. And knowing the ending does not necessarily ruin the suspense: \u201cPeople underestimate the extent to which you inhabit a story while you\u2019re engaged with it\u2026\u2009The situation is still unfolding in front of you.\u201d. I can relate to this. In films I\u2019ve seen multiple times, I still root for the guy to get the girl; I still hope the catastrophe I know is coming can be averted. There are also times when having a better understanding can improve the experience \u2013 I always read the synopsis before going to see an opera.. But there is a difference between choosing to find out what happens and suddenly learning something you were not meant to. The former is not really a \u201cspoiler\u201d at all, but the latter is, and there is a sense of disappointment in an accidental discovery \u2013 both in fiction and in life.. Other research has provided a more nuanced picture. A 2016 study found that those of us who have what psychologists call a \u201cneed for cognition\u201d \u2013 that is, who are inclined to undergo effortful cognitive activity \u2013 are more likely to want to be kept in suspense. So are those of us who have a \u201cneed for affect\u201d, meaning a desire to experience many different emotional states. I think I have a need for both.. Spoilers do, to some extent, \u201cspoil\u201d our enjoyment of the escapist entertainment a show like Succession provides. I propose, for future \u201cappointment TV\u201d, a 24-hour embargo for the discussion of crucial plot developments to allow all time zones to catch up. After that, it is open season.. We shouldn\u2019t kill the thrill of suspense, but neither should we deprive people of the rare opportunity to come together for a happy and frivolous reason, all at once, in the overwhelming, endless, and often misery-inducing expanse that is the Internet.

    "context": "Martin Ivens. Nothing became him in life like the leaving of it, says a character from Macbeth of the traitor Cawdor\u2019s acceptance of his execution. Mr Boris Johnson may have once been commissioned to write a study of Shakespeare, but he has never taken that particular line to heart. Perhaps that\u2019s why he returned the publisher\u2019s advance.. Late on Friday, Mr Johnson resigned abruptly as an MP rather than fight a by-election after an investigation found that he had misled Parliament over the Downing Street parties scandal. In a vituperative 1,000-word statement, he condemned his accusers and then launched a frontal assault on Prime Minister Rishi Sunak for betraying Brexit and leading the Conservative party to electoral disaster. He is unlikely to go gentle into that good night.. When a senior minister, Mr Michael Gove, suggested that Mr Johnson resign as prime minister after his authority crumbled in 2022, he fired the man on the spot. Three-time election winners like Mrs Margaret Thatcher and Mr Tony Blair may have allowed themselves to be pushed into the departure lounge of politics by colleagues, but Boris was never going to go peaceably. Nor has he quite gone.. Polling expert Matthew Goodwin, who has charted the rise of British populism sympathetically, notes this weekend that Mr Johnson has already brought down three prime ministers. First was Mr David Cameron, over Brexit. Next came his successor, Mrs Theresa May, over the terms of the exit deal. Finally, he scuppered his own leadership by breaking lockdown rules during the pandemic and failing to be frank about it. Now he has a fourth prime minister in his sights \u2013 Mr Sunak.. Mr Johnson may be sincere in some of what he wrote in his resignation statement \u2013 the self-pity is certainly authentic and has always been his Achilles heel (as I know from my days as a newspaper editor, fending off injured replies when he felt he had been traduced \u2013 or simply not loved enough). It does, however, veer towards a skewed representation of the truth \u2013 he knows that Mr Sunak\u2019s credentials as a Brexiteer have never been in doubt. The two just differ on what can practically be delivered to enforce the separation from the European Union.. In the statement, Mr Johnson accuses the cross-party House of Commons Privileges Committee of seven MPs of being \u201cdetermined to use the proceedings against me to drive me out of Parliament\u201d, which he says sets an \u201cunsettling\u201d and undemocratic precedent. Its Labour chair, Ms Harriet Harman, is indeed a sworn enemy \u2013 but her committee has a Conservative majority.. Mr Johnson is addicted to risk-taking and the limelight. He could, of course, butt out of politics altogether and add to his mountainous cash pile acquired from public-speaking engagements \u2013 he has earned more than \u00a36.5 million (S$11 million) in the last year alone. But although he loves the money, he might soon get bored.. It\u2019s nice being feted abroad, especially in the US, and in Ukraine he gets a hero\u2019s welcome for his full-throated defence of that nation. But he may miss the applause back home. Domestic journalists are obsessed with him, with the media lapping up his every word. Like Oscar Wilde, he is a self-publicist who believes there\u2019s nothing worse than being talked about, other than not being talked about.. So, the great gambler of modern British politics may be embarking upon his biggest crapshoot so far, and the stakes are high \u2013 and not only for him. For there is usually method in what his liberal and left-wing critics take to be political madness.. The clue lies in the Trumpian vocabulary of his resignation statement \u2013 \u201cwitch-hunts\u201d, \u201ckangaroo court\u201d, \u201cbetrayal\u201d. Like his recent host, the former president of the United States, Mr Johnson has rejected the process that brought him low.. On the right of British politics, strong winds are still blowing towards populism. Although Mr Johnson\u2019s popularity in the country at large has plummeted since his huge electoral win in 2019, many Conservative voters and party members still regard him as their once and future king. Mr Sunak comes mid-level in the popularity polls of the ConservativeHome website.. The ruling party is at a crossroads. Mr Sunak was not the first choice of party members (Mr Johnson chooses to regard him as a scheming back-stabber following Mr Sunak\u2019s resignation as his Chancellor of the Exchequer). The tax-cutting revolution of Ms Liz Truss, Mr Johnson\u2019s anointed successor, may have crashed and burned on contact with reality last autumn, but that agenda still gets Tory pulses racing. Panicky Conservative MPs have recently been clamouring for the abolition of inheritance tax. They want income tax cuts, too; in fact, anything to bribe the voters with their own money before the next election.. Politics, like comedy, is about the way you tell them. Mr Sunak\u2019s credentials as a right-winger on immigration, Brexit and free-market economics are the real thing. But activists see income and business taxes rising to unprecedented post-war levels. Then they look at their leader, a soft-spoken former Goldman Sachs banker in a sharp suit and Prada loafers, and despair of him retaining the Brexit-supporting voters of \u201cleft-behind Britain\u201d acquired at the last election.. The party faithful\u2019s heads tell them they can\u2019t have Trussonomics, but their hearts are with Mr Johnson\u2019s philosophy of \u201ccakeism\u201d \u2013 having it and eating it, with both high spending and low taxes.. Why should Boris volunteer for the ignominy of by-election defeat in his Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency, with its vulnerable majority, when he can live to fight another day, say his allies? Perhaps another departing Tory MP will help gift him a safe seat, if his candidacy is not blocked by Conservative headquarters.. In any case, if Mr Sunak goes crashing down to defeat in the next 18 months, Tory associations, by Mr Johnson\u2019s reckoning, will demand his return.. Mr Sunak is already walking, in the words of his top strategist Isaac Levido, \u201ca narrow path to victory\u201d. The Labour opposition has a large lead in the polls and its leader, Mr Keir Starmer, has wiped out left-wing dissent in his ranks. Although the present prime minister no longer fears a threat from Mr Johnson\u2019s dwindling band of backbench supporters, the Boris circus is a distraction he can do without. It makes him look weak, and the party divided.. It also, however, reminds Mr Sunak that he needs to expedite and focus his push for re-election. Failure will almost certainly bring the noisiest of political exiles back to the fray for the Tory crown. BLOOMBERG",

    "context": "Simon Kuper. When Manchester City lifted their first Champions League trophy in Istanbul on Saturday night, the Gulf\u2019s rapid takeover of European football\u2019s commanding heights was complete. City\u2019s owner, watching his team in a competitive match for the first time since 2010, is the Emirati royal Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan. His Qatari neighbours hosted this winter\u2019s World Cup. Saudi clubs have spent the past few months signing some of the world\u2019s best players, including Cristiano Ronaldo. Meanwhile, in the week of City\u2019s triumph, Saudi Arabia effectively took control of golf\u2019s PGA tour.. No region outside Western Europe has ever had such a grip on football\u2019s shiniest baubles. Many fans lament this \u2013 partly because of the Gulf monarchies\u2019 mistreatment of women, migrants, LGBT people and dissidents, and partly from a feeling that football shouldn\u2019t be for sale. There are still attempts to contest the Gulf\u2019s dominance. The Premier League has referred City to an independent commission, which will review more than 100 allegations of financial rule-breaking \u2013 charges that the club denies. But football faces a dilemma. Gulf money has made the contest at the top of the European game much more exciting than it would have been otherwise.. Look at how Emirati funds lifted Manchester City from joke status into football\u2019s trendsetting team. Every City fan in Istanbul over the age of 30 could remember the years of stumbles. In 1998-1999, the team spent an embarrassing season in English football\u2019s third tier. City\u2019s fans often treated their club almost as the footballing branch of Monty Python. They waved inflatable plastic bananas and sang, surreally, \u201cWe\u2019re not really here.\u201d. That old City survives only in the form of songs, dances and memories. On the field, the Emiratis transformed the club. Their money bought players who won trophies, in the process wiping out the old football cliche that held: \u201cYou can\u2019t buy a winning team.\u201d. In fact, if you want a winning team, you have to buy it, with salaries and usually with transfer fees, too. The ugly truth of football economics is that the only way for Cinderella to become a princess is to be bought by a prince.. City are following in the oil-fuelled slipstream of Chelsea, who were bought by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich in 2003. The two clubs between them won 12 of the last 19 English titles. They are also the only European clubs since 1999 to win a Champions League for the first time. Oil money has allowed two upstarts to beat the established powers.. English football could have taken a different route, rejecting Gulf money. It could have followed Germany, with its \u201c50 + 1 rule\u201d, which states that club members must hold a majority of voting rights. That stops outsiders from taking over clubs. The rule is often praised by football traditionalists. However, it means that German football has no oil-fuelled upstarts. The consequence is that the German club with historically the highest revenues, Bayern Munich, faces no serious challengers, and has won 11 league titles in a row. The rule also means that no other club from Europe\u2019s biggest economy has a hope of winning the Champions League, whereas three different English clubs have won in just the last five seasons. Now yet another oil-fuelled challenger may be emerging: Saudi-owned Newcastle United, freshly qualified for the Champions League.. Gulf money will probably keep shaping football for a while yet. Qatari Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani is bidding to buy Manchester United from the Glazer family, and Saudi Arabia may bid to host the 2030 World Cup, perhaps jointly with Greece and Egypt.. The monarchies\u2019 spending on football is often explained as a cunning plan to \u201csportswash\u201d their reputations, or as an \u201cinvestment\u201d to diversify their economies away from oil and gas \u2013 even though football clubs typically lose money, especially given the salaries that the Gulf royals pay.. In fact, there is a simpler explanation for why these people went into football: It\u2019s fun. It makes their friends and neighbours jealous. It\u2019s an affordable hobby for billionaires. And they face almost no competition from their peers elsewhere. Mr Abramovich and other Russian oligarchs have been expelled from the sport since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, few Chinese ever entered, while most Americans who buy into football want to make profits from their clubs, and therefore baulk at paying the salaries that would allow their teams to compete with the likes of City.. So European football has become a status competition between Gulf monarchies, with City showing the potential to build a dynasty. The men\u2019s team coach, Pep Guardiola, in situ since 2016, has constructed one of the great teams in football history, even if they didn\u2019t show it in Istanbul. This season they have won the treble of Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup. They attack, they are tactically innovative, and the current squad is young enough to remain dominant. Early on Sunday morning, exhausted in triumph, Guardiola warned Real Madrid, who have won 14 Champions Leagues to City\u2019s one: \u201cWe are on our way. If they fall asleep, we will be catching them.\u201d That may not have been a joke. FINANCIAL TIMES",

    "context": "Karen Tee. A number of years ago, I remember excitedly anticipating a dinner reunion with a few of my teenage-era friends whom I had recently reconnected with. Back in the day, we were really close, sometimes egging each other on to defy our well-meaning teachers and then, when push came to shove, pulling all-nighters together to study for examinations.. But when we finally met up again as adults, the chemistry had evaporated. I no longer found our shared jokes funny, and our updates about our respective life choices in the years since graduating struck me as mundane.. The others likely felt the same way as none of us took the effort to initiate conversation or meet up again. It was to the best of my knowledge, a multi-way ghosting, with each of us abruptly cutting off communication without prior explanation.. Having gone through the classic five stages of grief (denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance) when I was previously ghosted by an ex, I expected to feel at least a tinge of sadness at this unceremonious end to a once-cherished friendship circle. In fact, a recent study found that people often feel just as hurt at being ghosted by a friend as they do with a romantic partner.. But surprisingly, I was unmoved by the entire experience. Instead, I felt a sense of relief that I had freed up time to focus on other things that I found more important without having to go through the whole rigmarole of explaining myself to someone else. They included work commitments and also nurturing new friendships with other people whom I felt a deeper connection with at that stage in life.. Certainly, there is catharsis in wallowing in grief when losing a friend. Like with any other broken relationship, psychologists recommend taking time to express your emotions such as by journalling or indulging in a good cry, if you feel so inclined.. Yet it is a reality that many friendships tend to fall by the wayside in our 30s and 40s. As Julie Beck, senior editor of the family section at The Atlantic observes, unlike the close-knit core friendships that those in their teens and 20s tend to forge and rely on, priorities change quite drastically later in life.. Life happens. Marriage, childbirth and caring for elderly parents take centre stage, so it makes sense that platonic friendships, which are voluntary by nature, become less important.. Certainly, we all probably have a personal story to share about friends who fell off the radar or stopped sending WhatsApp messages after they had kids. In this time-pressed world, who can blame them for not staying in contact, with other matters vying for their attention?. This is why my preferred coping mechanism, which is also recommended by experts, is to reframe one\u2019s perspective. Instead of regarding a ghosted friendship as a deliberate rejection \u2013 which would be the case if a romantic partner did ghost you \u2013 simply tell yourself that life got in the way. This way, there is no reason to behave like a jilted lover. Rather, I prefer to move on quickly with no drama and focus my headspace on other priorities instead.. Still, it is true that friendships are integral to one\u2019s happiness. In the book Friends: Understanding The Power Of Our Most Important Relationships, psychologist and author Robin Dunbar writes that the quality of our friendships has a huge influence on our happiness, health and even mortality.. Dunbar, who famously came up with the hypothesis that each individual typically has the bandwidth for 150 friends, also posits that it is one\u2019s inner circle of about 15 closer friends who will be there to offer emotional, physical and financial help in times of need.. So, if anything, it is even more essential to cultivate and perhaps curate these friendships so that they align with one\u2019s priorities and needs at any given stage in life. Even now in my 30s, I see no reason why I should stop making new friends and often take the effort to attend social or networking events to connect with like-minded people.. Unsentimental as it may sound, I am also clear-eyed when friends drift apart. Likewise, I do not begrudge formerly close friends when they decide they would rather devote precious spare time to nurturing other friendship groups that they feel closer to.. In these cases, ghosting actually turns out to be a useful method for letting friendships melt away gently into the good night. Its very ambiguity, when one \u2013 or both \u2013 parties simply stop communicating without a farewell note, actually leaves the door open for a reconciliation in the future.. Hence, when a recent WhatsApp group I am a part of erupted in a flurry of ongoing messages about children and pre-school options, I resisted the urge to abruptly leave the chat even though I have very little interest in baby talk. There was no reason to make others uncomfortable with an unannounced exit when they were exchanging notes on things that mattered to them.. Instead, I did some ghosting of my own by archiving the chat so that my phone will not be inundated with message alerts. It is likely I will stay out of this chat group for as long as the discussions are all about child-related travails.. But some day in the future, should the chatter drift towards a topic that catches my interest, I will take it as my cue to pick up where I last left off with a nonchalant, \u201cHello! Remember me?\u201d. After all, I never really did \u201cbreak up\u201d with them, I just drifted away for a while.",

    "context": "Martin Wolf. The future is Asian, argues the respected analyst Parag Khanna. But this piece of conventional wisdom needs unwrapping. Geographically, Asia is no more a continent than is Europe. \u201cAsia\u201d itself is not even an Asian idea: Europeans invented it. Asians did not conceive of themselves as being part of a single continental entity. The region is too vast and diverse for that to have been possible.. It still is. What is happening is rather a global rebalancing, as the historically brief but world-changing domination over humanity of Europe and its colonial progeny dwindles away. A multipolar and messy world will replace it. Will \u201cAsia\u201d make up a huge part of this? Certainly. China and India will be actors. But Asia is rather an arena than an actor.. Look at a globe: Europe and Asia are one continent. For historical and cultural reasons, it also makes sense to include north Africa in Asia, rather than Africa. This then is Eurasia, the continent of the long-lasting human civilisations. Historically, this supercontinent was home to Confucian civilisation to the east, Hindu civilisation to the south, Islamic civilisation in the near west and Christendom in the far west. To the north were the steppe nomads. The interactions among these neighbours were profound. But Eurasia was too vast to be, or to be conceived of as, a unity.. The Greeks appear to have invented the idea of dividing this single continent into two. The name is first attested in Herodotus, in about 440BC. At that time, nobody knew quite how vast what he called Asia was.. The British historian John Hale argues that the name \u201cEurope\u201d also replaced \u201cChristendom\u201d during the Renaissance. With Europe imagined as a separate continent, Asia was the name for the vast and diverse areas to the east. But only in the past few centuries did economic, technological and military change give Europe and its offshoots domination. The distinction between Europe and Asia became real in terms of military conquests and extraordinary gaps in wealth.. The late British economist Angus Maddison argued that, in 1820, the real gross domestic product per head of Western Europe was a little over double that of East Asia. By 1950, the ratio had soared to 6.5 times. But, by 2018, it had fallen back to just 2.4 times, almost where it was two centuries ago.. In 1820, Asia generated 61 per cent of world output, while Western Europe generated only 25 per cent. By 1950, the Asian share had collapsed to a mere 20 per cent, while Western Europe\u2019s had reached 26 per cent. By 2018, however, Western Europe\u2019s share was down to 15 per cent, while Asia\u2019s had recovered all the way back to 48 per cent.. Eurasia has rebalanced quite a bit. What about its weight in the world? Over the past two centuries, it declined, as output jumped in the Americas and populations also jumped there and in sub-Saharan Africa. But Eurasia remains the heartland of humanity. The share of the population of Eurasia in the world total was still 72 per cent in 2018, albeit down from 91 in 1820. Similarly, its share in global output was 70 per cent, down from 92 per cent in 1820 (with much of the rest, inevitably, in North America).. The big story then is of the recovery of what we call Asia, led by east Asia, from its steep relative economic decline in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In the process, Eurasia has substantially rebalanced and so, quite naturally, has the world as a whole. This \u201cgreat convergence\u201d is also not due to some uniquely \u201cAsian\u201d culture. The very different cultures of Asia, and especially of east and south Asia, have embraced what one might consider European notions: competitive markets, free enterprise, liberal trade, education and the goal of economic growth.. Precise packages vary. They depend on the histories and political cultures of specific societies. China and India, for example, are extraordinarily different from each other. But many of these societies do share a desire for more prosperous lives. Yet this is not by any means uniquely Asian. It is universal. What is a little less so, alas, is the ability to organise societies in ways that make the achievement possible. There is no doubt that over the past decades, Asian societies, notably those of east Asia, have been hugely successful in this regard.. It is not at all surprising that this catch-up by such a vast number of people generates huge opportunities for commerce among them, as the McKinsey Global Institute has noted. The creation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership around China (but without India) suggests this may develop faster, though it also underlines the almost inevitable centrality of China in any such process of integration.. What then can we say about this rebalancing of Eurasia and so the world? The most important point is that it is natural. The extraordinary power enjoyed by Europeans and the United States, their potent progeny, is dwindling. Not surprisingly, what we call Asia, close to half of the human population and home to some of the world\u2019s historic civilisations, is leading the change. Barring catastrophes, this is also likely to continue. The world economy\u2019s centre of gravity is simply shifting east. Asia then will be hugely economically and politically important. But it will also have highly significant internal rivalries and difficulties of its own. There will be no collective Asian \u201cwill\u201d, other than for societies to pursue their own paths.. Meanwhile, the West needs to get two contrasting thoughts into its collective head. First, it must deal with the world as it is. Second, it must defend the best of its values, notably democracy and individual freedom, regardless of what anybody else in the world thinks. Who, after all, supposed life would get easier?

    "context": "The key priorities of nations in the age of the digital economy include the responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI), cyber security and connectivity. Touching on this crucial issue last week, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong drew attention to the transformative role that AI could play in the economic evolution of Singapore, which has never been shy to embrace the accelerative role of technology in its journey from penury to success. But the stakes are higher today. While AI could shake up the digital economy, it also possesses biases that could compromise its decision-making, with serious implications for societies. Ensuring the ethics of AI usage, therefore, is crucial to its future, as beneficial technology acts as a force multiplier in social and economic relations.. Explaining AI\u2019s importance, Minister for Communications and Information Josephine Teo has compared it to electricity. Electricity by itself brings humans little benefit, but when it is used to power appliances and equipment, people gain so much more by way of convenience, productivity and capabilities, she said recently. Likewise, AI \u2013 which is the power of human-like intelligence and potentially a very high form of it, at far reduced cost \u2013 benefits Singapore, which depends on human capital, Mrs Teo added. Just as the improper use of appliances and equipment can cause electrocution, the inappropriate use of AI can do great harm. Hence the need to harness it within guard rails necessary for its safe design and responsible use.. Clearly, the Government views AI as a net technological contributor to the public good, with the risks that it poses needing to be minimised. Singapore is striving to do so by developing frameworks to promote accountability and trust. It published a Model AI Governance Framework in 2019, which was, and remains, the first of its kind in Asia. In 2022, the country introduced AI Verify, a governance testing framework and toolkit. Now, vanguard actors in AI have allied themselves with the authorities here to tackle issues such as bias and copyright. The Singapore-based AI Verify Foundation, which consists of at least 60 global industry players, will discuss AI standards and best practices, and create a neutral platform for collaboration on governing AI.. International collaboration is crucial so that Singapore benefits from the latest in AI thinking but remains alert to the constant need to control the potential for abuse. Of particular concern is generative AI, the foundation on which other apps are built. Machines that appear to have a mind of their own present an affront to human consciousness. The answer lies not in trying to ban the presence of such machines, which is difficult, if not impossible, but in ensuring that AI is developed and used responsibly. That effort lies within the realm of human capability.",

    "context": "For more than a decade, the leadership of the World Bank has been riddled with controversy. The two most recent presidents, Dr Kim Jim Yong and Mr David Malpass, resigned before completing their full terms. Dr Kim, a physician who was appointed in 2012, presided over a chaotic reorganisation of the bank and lost the confidence of its staff, while Mr Malpass, a former Treasury department official from the Trump administration, was severely criticised by scientists, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and members of the US Congress for failing to address the climate crisis, and indeed, for being a climate denier.. The World Bank now has a new president, Mr Ajay Banga, an American citizen of Indian origin. The United States is the largest shareholder of the World Bank and has always appointed its president, even though it has no formal mandate to do so.. In recent years, developing countries \u2013 which make up the majority of the bank\u2019s clients \u2013 NGOs, former senior bank officials and even the bank\u2019s staff association have been lobbying for the bank to be led by someone other than an American male. One of their arguments is that since promoting development is the core mission of the bank, its leader should be drawn from among candidates from developing countries who have experience and expertise in tackling development-related challenges.. The Biden administration has finessed the issue by choosing Mr Banga, who was born and educated in India, and has extensive international experience, having worked with multinational enterprises, including Nestle, Citibank, and more recently, Mastercard, where he was chief executive \u2013 at each of which, his achievements were impressive. As a consummate financial manager, a champion of diversity, a supporter of climate activism and well-versed in many of the challenges facing the developing world, he has been cautiously welcomed by the bank\u2019s stakeholders, notwithstanding the fact that he is yet another American male.. Mr Banga will have his work cut out. He takes charge at a time of slowing global growth, deepening poverty in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, a serious debt crisis in the developing world, and more frequent climate shocks. He has pledged to leverage the bank\u2019s balance sheet to catalyse additional finance from partners, including other multilateral lenders, the private sector and NGOs. In addition, he would need to orchestrate a capital increase for the bank as well as governance reforms to ensure developing countries have a bigger say in its operations and priorities.. He deserves all possible support from the bank\u2019s stakeholders. But they should not let up on their mission to ensure that the leadership of the bank is truly merit-based, internationally sourced and not a continuing monopoly of the US.",

    "context": "Simone Peinkofer. E-commerce may make shopping more convenient, but it has a dark side that most consumers never see.. Say you order an electric toothbrush for Father\u2019s Day and two shirts for yourself from Amazon. You unpack your order and discover that the electric toothbrush will not charge, and only one shirt fits you. So, you decide to return the unwanted shirt and the electric toothbrush.. Returns like this might seem simple, and often they are free for the consumer. But managing those returns can get costly for retailers, so much so that many returned items are simply thrown out.. In 2022, returns cost retailers about US$816 billion (S$1.1 trillion) in lost sales. That is nearly as much as what the United States spent on public schools and almost twice the cost of returns in 2020. The return process, with transportation and packaging, also generated about 24 million tonnes of planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions in 2022.. Together, costs and emissions create a sustainability problem for retailers and the planet.. As a supply chain management researcher, I follow developments in retail logistics. Let\u2019s take a closer look inside the black box of product returns.. So, you repackaged your unwanted shirt and the electric toothbrush and drove them to UPS, which has an agreement with Amazon for free returns. Now what?. UPS transports those items to the retailer\u2019s warehouses dedicated to processing returns. This step of the process costs the retailer money \u2013 66 per cent of the cost of a US$50 item by one estimate \u2013 and emits carbon dioxide as trucks and planes carry items hundreds of kilometres. The plastic, paper or cardboard from the return package becomes waste.. Processing a return takes two to three times longer than initially shipping the item \u2013 it has to be unpacked, inspected, repacked and rerouted. That adds more to the cost to the company, especially in a tight labour market. Workers have to manually unpack the items, inspect them and, based on the return reason, decide what will happen next.. If a warehouse worker decides the shirt in our example can be resold, the shirt will be repackaged and sent to another warehouse.. Once another consumer orders the shirt, it will be ready to be packed and shipped.. In-store returns can significantly cut warehouse and transportation costs, but driving to a bricks-and-mortar store might not be convenient for the consumer. Only about a quarter of online purchases are returned in person to the store.. If the item is defective, like the electric toothbrush in our example, the warehouse worker might send it back to the manufacturer for fixing and refurbishing. It would be repackaged and loaded on a truck and possibly a plane to be sent to the manufacturer, leading to more carbon dioxide emissions.. If the electric toothbrush can be repaired, the refurbished product is ready to be sold into the consumer market again \u2013 often at a lower price.. Refurbishing returned products helps to achieve a closed-loop supply chain where products are reused rather than disposed of as waste, making the process more sustainable than buying a new item.. Sometimes, however, repairs cost more than the product can be resold for. When it is more expensive to restock or refurbish a product, it may be cheaper for the retailer to throw the item away.. If the company cannot resell the shirt or refurbish the electric toothbrush economically, the outlook for these items is grim. Some are sold in bulk to discount stores. Often, returned products simply end up in landfills, sometimes overseas.. In 2019, about 2.3 million tonnes of waste from returns were sent to landfills, according to an estimate by return technology platform Optoro. By 2022, the estimated waste had more than doubled to about 4.74 million tonnes.. In the past, customers who wanted to return items by mail were often expected to do so on their own dime. That changed after Amazon began offering free returns and providing easy-to-use drop-off locations at UPS or Kohl\u2019s stores. Other retailers followed suit to compete, with many seeing free returns as a way to keep shoppers coming back.. But that pendulum may be starting to swing back. The percentage of retailers charging to ship returns increased from 33 per cent to 41 per cent in 2022.. Retailers are trying several other techniques to lower the return rate, waste and losses, which ultimately come back to consumers in the form of higher prices.. Some retailers have shortened the return window, limited frequent returns, or stopped offering free returns.. Other strategies include virtual dressing rooms and clearer fitting guides, which can help reduce clothing returns, as can high-quality photos and videos that reflect size and colour accurately.. If consumers use those tools and pay attention to sizing, they can help cut down on retail\u2019s growing climate footprint.",

    "context": "It is extremely troubling that a recent study, conducted by Duke-NUS Medical School and the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), has suggested that anxiety and depression symptoms among people here could be costing Singapore nearly $16 billion a year, or about 2.9 per cent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product. This is so as a result of absenteeism, reduced productivity, and the use of healthcare resources. According to the researchers, this is the first study after the coronavirus pandemic that estimates the prevalence of, and quantifies the financial cost of, depression and anxiety symptoms among Singaporean adults. While the economic and social dislocation produced by Covid-19 expectedly produced a decline in mental health, what is worrying is that even the national recovery from that period of stress did not produce better results in the survey, which covered 5,725 Singaporeans above 21 years old between April and June 2022. Clearly, mental health is an issue that Singapore must grapple with urgently.. The lesson to be drawn from the survey is the need to treat mental health on a par with physical health. Singapore possesses admirable assets by way of its hospitals, both public and private, its step-down care facilities, its polyclinics, its general practitioners, and its specialists. They cater to the physical well-being of residents in a way that justifies Singapore\u2019s reputation for First World healthcare. Mental health, too, is addressed by the IMH, private institutions and civil society organisations. However, the stigma attached traditionally to mental problems \u2013 in a way that does not affect those seeking medical care for physical ailments \u2013 deters many sufferers from seeking early and preventive care. As a result, they suffer in silence when there are avenues open for their treatment and rehabilitation. Some prefer to go into denial mode. Such attitudes should not exist in a mature society. People must understand that it is not morally reprehensible to be mentally unwell, any more than it is to be physically sick.. It is reassuring that companies are stepping up efforts to help staff with mental health issues. Stress and burnout, to say nothing about anxiety and depression, are workplace ills that erode the human talent on which corporate success is based ultimately. Companies which treat staff under mental pressure with understanding and empathy are likely to have employees who are motivated because they feel valued. Sufferers, too, would come forward for help early because they would not fear being stigmatised by colleagues. More companies here are including mental wellness benefits in their corporate insurance coverage in a healthy sign of the times.. Anxiety and depression are global problems that are taking a heavy toll on productivity. It is imperative in Singapore that family members, community organisations, care services and companies work together more closely to have a helping hand ready always for sufferers.",

    "context": "David Fickling. For those who have followed the energy transition over the past few decades, there is one technology that is treated as much as a punchline as a serious industry: Carbon capture and storage, or CCS.. A decade or so ago, many still thought it was the best hope for decarbonising the world\u2019s power systems. CCS was \u201cthe Google and Intel of the energy world\u201d, the Atlantic magazine declared in a 2010 cover story that predicted solar and wind would never get above 10 per cent of power supply.. In the following decade, it was renewables that boomed while CCS went bust. Wind and solar accounted for 39 per cent of generation in Germany in the first quarter of 2023 and will hit 50 per cent over the full year in Spain. Meanwhile, only a handful of demonstration CCS plants went into operation \u2013 and one of the biggest was switched off in 2021 as oil prices plummeted, since it had been able to make money only from the decidedly dirty business of driving carbon dioxide into depleted oil wells to force out fresh crude.. There are signs that CCS may be about to get the last laugh, though. In Britain, the government has promised as much as \u00a320 billion (S$33.9 billion) in spending to kick-start the sector. A tender to scope out sites that could store as much as 10 per cent of the country\u2019s emissions in old North Sea oilfields closed comfortably oversubscribed in May. In the Gulf of Mexico, ExxonMobil has spent about US$25 million (S$33.6 million) in two recent rounds bidding for nearly 170 blocks of depleted offshore acreage that might be able to store carbon from a planned hub in Houston, Texas. The world\u2019s first CCS project at a cement plant is slated to start in 2024 at a Heidelberg Materials facility in Norway.. What\u2019s different now? In essence, a business that was always viable technologically has finally found an economic rationale. The problem with CCS was never that it did not work: Norway\u2019s Sleipner carbon capture project has been quietly pumping about 1 million tonnes annually under the North Sea for nearly 20 years since it was built to evade a 1991 carbon tax. Elsewhere in the world, however, there was no way to get paid.. That has changed with the US Inflation Reduction Act and the surging value of the European Union\u2019s carbon permits. CCS does not really become viable anywhere south of US$70 a metric tonne, and until about 18 months ago the only countries putting a price on carbon at that level were in Scandinavia and the Alps.. Since the start of 2022, however, European carbon has averaged US$89 a tonne, while the Biden administration\u2019s climate Bill has introduced an US$85/tonne tax credit for CCS. Roughly a third of the world economy has suddenly priced carbon dioxide (CO2) at a level where, in theory, there should be good money in locking it up underground.. All the hype from the 2000s has cast a long shadow. CCS is still seen by many energy specialists as a pipe dream at best, and at worst a mendacious attempt to rebrand fossil fuels without doing the hard work of decarbonisation. The main end-use for which it was pitched a decade ago \u2013 power generation \u2013 has also been invalidated by the slumping costs of renewable power.. Even if you exclude electricity, however, there is a big slice of industry where CCS could yet be crucial. Power generation accounts for about 40 per cent of the world\u2019s CO2 emissions, but another fifth comes from steel, cement and chemicals \u2013 and renewables are not well-suited to abating that pollution. Until technologies such as green steel and green hydrogen get up to speed and someone invents a viable way of making zero-carbon cement, we could use a functioning CCS sector to keep that CO2 out of the atmosphere.. CCS has another benefit, too. The developed world\u2019s shift to a more aggressive decarbonisation pathway risks leaving many emerging economies stranded. Falling fossil fuel demand will kill off one of their main raw materials export industries, while carbon border taxes threaten future manufacturing sectors. A global carbon trade offers a solution to that problem, giving nations with the right geology the ability to make money from sequestering other people\u2019s carbon.. In places, the carbon content of a barrel of oil is already worth more than the fuel. EU pricing for the emissions from heavy Canadian crude is currently about 25 per cent above the cost of the crude itself. That\u2019s potentially a revenue stream that oil-dependent nations in Africa and the Middle East could monetise.. Governments should do everything they can to foster this trend \u2013 and to encourage China, attempting a crackdown on the heavy industries that account for more than half of its pollution, to lift its own anaemic US$8.24 a tonne carbon price to similar paradigm-changing levels.. Swathes of the world made money in the 20th century from selling the carbon currently devastating our natural environment. In the 21st century, the same nations might make money from burying it instead. BLOOMBERG",

    "context": "Nicolas Kristof. In 1971, a half-dozen graduate students at Oxford University held what was perhaps the first protest of the modern animal rights movement. They insisted that respecting animals was a moral imperative.. And the world changed.. No, not right away. But one of those students, a young Australian philosopher named Peter Singer, turned his ideas into a transformative 1975 book, Animal Liberation, that was initially mocked for overreach. \u201cThe animal movement was still widely seen as crackpot,\u201d Professor Singer recalls.. Yet, to anyone who thinks that ideas are irrelevant in a practical age, think again. His arguments stirred a slow-motion revolution that has changed the way we treat other animals.. Prof Singer has just issued a new edition of the book, updated and titled Animal Liberation Now. It\u2019s a monument to the remarkable spread of the ideas he articulated in 1975. At least nine states and the European Union now ban veal crates, hen cages or tight stalls for sows. The top supermarket chains in America have agreed to sell only cage-free eggs by 2026, and McDonalds has done the same.. A court in Argentina accepted that habeas corpus rights apply to a chimpanzee. Israel and California have banned the sale of fur coats. Pope Francis has suggested that animals go to Heaven and that the Virgin Mary \u201cgrieves for the sufferings\u201d of mistreated livestock.. How times have changed. When Mary Wollstonecraft advocated for the rights of women in 1792, that seemed to some so ridiculous that a satirist mocked her by calling for the rights of animals as well. Now, it\u2019s unquestioned (at least in the abstract) that rights extend to people of all races and religions, including women, and in some cases to animals as well. When voters face referendums on animal rights, they often approve them by large margins.. Yet, there\u2019s so much more to be done, as the new edition of Prof Singer\u2019s book documents.. Agribusiness has been very successful at two things: producing very cheap protein and hiding from public view the cruelty that has been ingrained in factory farming to cut costs.. An individual seen whipping a dog risks arrest, but chief executives whose companies in effect torture chickens are celebrated for their business acumen. Individualised animal abuse is a crime; systematic animal abuse is a business model.. Prof Singer writes about how poultry has been bred so birds grow extremely quickly and with huge breasts, since breast meat is particularly valuable. By one estimate, if human babies grew at the same pace as today\u2019s broiler chickens, at two months, they would weigh 660 pounds \u2013 so it\u2019s no surprise that chickens\u2019 legs often give out and that by some accounts, they suffer chronic pain.. When animals are reduced to widgets to maximise quarterly profits, it\u2019s inevitable that there will be mistreatment. A farm in San Diego reportedly disposed of 30,000 live, squirming hens (who apparently were no longer producing sufficient eggs) by feeding them into a wood chipper. It was cost-effective.. For the last half-dozen years, I\u2019ve avoided meat, in part because of Prof Singer\u2019s writing, in part because of my experience raising livestock and poultry on our family farm, and in part nudged by my daughter. But I puzzle over the complexities.. I don\u2019t eat factory-farmed food, but is it okay to eat farm animals that have been humanely raised? (I could be open to that; after all, I do eat animals like elk that have been hunted, partly because natural predators are rare.) I stopped eating octopus after reading a book about their intelligence and empathy, but what about shrimp? (For now, I do eat shrimp and other shellfish.). To me, the central issue is as philosopher Jeremy Bentham expressed it in the 18th century: \u201cThe question is not, can they reason, nor can they talk, but can they suffer?\u201d And the answers for, say, oysters, aren\u2019t always obvious.. We haven\u2019t figured out our moral obligations to fellow humans, so perhaps it\u2019s understandable that we haven\u2019t worked out our obligations to shellfish. But the way people struggle with these questions strikes me as a measure of moral progress \u2013 and of the power of ideas.. \u201cThe ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood,\u201d wrote John Maynard Keynes. \u201cIndeed the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\u201d. And so it is that a philosopher\u2019s book originally published almost half a century ago prodded our consciences and changed what will be on summer barbecue grills around the world. That is the moral force of an idea whose time has arrived. NYTIMES",
