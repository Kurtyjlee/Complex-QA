      "The Dyson device, which combines noise-cancelling headphones with a mouthpiece that blows filtered air, initially caught my attention. As someone who suffers from noise-induced migraines and chronic nasal congestion due to environmental pollutants, the idea of having a personal zone of quiet and clean air seemed appealing. However, upon closer inspection and a brief trial, I found the headphones heavy and the mask impractical for public use.

The passage explores this idea through the author's personal experiences with the Dyson device, which combines noise-cancelling headphones with a mouthpiece that blows filtered air, and the author's decision not to purchase the device. The passage also discusses the author's justification for living in a private condominium and owning a car, as well as the author's guilt about this and their efforts to engage with the community. The passage concludes by discussing the dual tendency for humans to seek both connection and separation from others and the importance of maintaining high standards for public services in order to discourage the creation of personal bubbles."

However, upon closer inspection and a brief trial, I found the headphones heavy and the mask impractical for public use.

Eventually, the calculation is made, and owning a car seems more advantageous, especially when coordinating transportation for a partner, children, or elderly parents.

      "The Dyson device, which combines noise-cancelling headphones with a mouthpiece that blows filtered air, initially caught my attention. As someone who suffers from noise-induced migraines and chronic nasal congestion due to environmental pollutants, the idea of having a personal zone of quiet and clean air seemed appealing. However, upon closer inspection and a brief trial, I found the headphones heavy and the mask impractical for public use. Moreover, the notion of isolating myself in a filtered bubble while living among others felt discordant. Ultimately, I decided against purchasing the device, but it made me contemplate the allure of retreating into a personal bubble versus engaging with the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my case, although I refrained from embracing the air bubble, I acknowledge that I've created a bubble of my own by living in a private condominium and owning a car. I justify these choices by considering the hard work I put into improving my social status. To assuage any guilt, I make efforts to engage with the community and support charitable causes. However, the temptation to gradually slip into a life of privilege is ever-present.\n",

      "Take transportation choices, for example. Initially, one may rely on public transport but occasionally opt for a taxi or private-hire car. As circumstances change, such as receiving a transport allowance or having limited time, the convenience of private-hire services becomes more enticing. Eventually, the calculation is made, and owning a car seems more advantageous, especially when coordinating transportation for a partner, children, or elderly parents. Climbing the career ladder may bring additional perks like a dedicated parking space or even a company car and driver. Before realizing it, one becomes accustomed to being chauffeured and grows frustrated when faced with the inconvenience of parking independently.\n",
