    "context": "SINGAPORE \u2013 More than 1,000 fans braved the mid-day heat to see South Korean actor Lee Do-hyun at Our Tampines Hub last Saturday.  This was his first visit to Singapore and, to his surprise, he was recognised when he visited a convenience store here upon his arrival last Friday.  Lee, 28, has starred in dramas 18 Again (2020) and Youth Of May (2021), but it was his role as a loyal plastic surgeon in the hit Netflix K-drama The Glory (2022 to 2023) that catapulted him to star status. Lee said the most memorable scene of The Glory was when he said \u201cI\u2019ll be your executioner\u201d to actress Song Hye-kyo. She starred in the show as the wronged protagonist, who hatches an elaborate revenge plan. \u201cIt was a difficult scene to execute, as that sentence is something people don\u2019t normally say,\u201d he said. The actor was in town for the Korea Travel Fair held at Our Tampines Hub. The fair featured more than 55 exhibitors, including regional tourism organisations, airlines, travel agencies and South Korean retailers.  The fair, which ended on Sunday, was hosted by the Korea Tourism Organization. More than 54,000 people had turned up at the fair as at 8pm last Saturday. Dressed in a tan suit, Lee took part in a travel talk-show segment during the fair. He recommended his dramas\u2019 filming locations to those visiting South Korea. Two of the locations were from The Glory. Cheongju Central Park was where Lee\u2019s character Joo Yeo-jeong taught Song\u2019s character Moon Dong-eun how to play the game baduk, also known as Go. Lee recommended the bulgogi (grilled and marinated meat) in Cheongju. The other location was Sodolhang Harbour Lighthouse in Gangneung, where Joo and Moon went for a romantic date.  His recommendations included Mount Seongheungsan Love Tree in Buyeo, featured in hit fantasy Hotel Del Luna (2019), and Paju First Garden from 18 Again, where Lee had his first lead role. \u201cI\u2019m a fan of tofu, so I like to eat the tofu in Paju,\u201d said the actor. Asked about his top three favourite Korean dishes, Lee listed pork belly, kimchi stew and japchae (stir-fried glass noodles). He also recommended the Han River, Busan and Gangneung as his top travel destinations in South Korea. Fans had arrived as early as 7am to secure their spots for the event. A fan who wanted to be known only as Ms Rianna, 28, said she had flown in from Indonesia to catch Lee at the fair.  She and her sister came with fan signs referencing his latest Netflix drama, The Good Bad Mother (2023). They had reached the venue by 7am to secure a spot closer to the stage. \u201cWe\u2019ve been big fans of his since Hotel Del Luna. Seeing him for the first time in person was unforgettable. I also got to know more about him,\u201d said Ms Rianna, who is pursuing a master\u2019s in business. Fellow fan Siti Aminah, 28, had arrived at the fair at about 9.45am. \u201cSeeing him walking past us was such an exhilarating moment \u2013 I felt like my heart stopped,\u201d said the teacher. \u201cHe\u2019s so eloquent and endearing. We want him to know he has lots of fans in Singapore. He\u2019s a good actor.\u201d She added that Lee has convinced her to fly to South Korea soon to try and visit the places he mentioned.",

It was the first time Ms Yaccarino, 59, has spoken publicly since the news broke on Thursday that she was in talks to become the next CEO of Twitter. Mr Musk, 51, who has served as CEO since his US$44 billion (S$59 billion) buyout of Twitter in October 2022, announced her appointment on Friday. \u201cI\u2019ve long been inspired by (Musk\u2019s) vision to create a brighter future. I\u2019m excited to help bring this vision to Twitter and transform this business together!\u201d she tweeted. Ms Yaccarino, who as advertising chief for Comcast Corp\u2019s NBCUniversal spent several years modernising its ad business, said she is committed to Twitter\u2019s future, and added that user feedback is vital to build Twitter 2.0. She will take over a social media platform that has been trying to reverse a plunge in ad revenue and is beset with challenges, along with a heavy debt load. Since Mr Musk acquired Twitter, advertisers have fled the platform, worried that their ads could appear next to inappropriate content after the company lost nearly 80 per cent of staff. Mr Musk earlier in 2023 acknowledged that Twitter had suffered a massive decline in ad revenue. While he said Ms Yaccarino would help build an \u201ceverything app\u201d, which he has previously said could offer a variety of services such as peer-to-peer payments, his selection of an advertising veteran signalled that digital ads would continue to be a core focus of the business. Mr Musk has long said he intended to find a new leader for Twitter. Mr Musk, who is also the CEO of electric-vehicle maker Tesla, on Friday said that bringing Ms Yaccarino on as Twitter\u2019s new chief will help him devote more time to Tesla. REUTERS",

    "context": "Kok Yufeng SINGAPORE \u2013 In order to help residents in Toa Payoh, especially seniors, live more healthily, Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) and Care Corner Singapore are actively reaching out to general practitioners (GPs) in the area.  This is so that the more than 60 family doctors practising in the neighbourhood are aware of the health and social services available within their communities, and can refer patients to these services.  It will also help prepare GPs for the July launch of Healthier SG \u2013 a national scheme that encourages residents to enrol with a family doctor who knows their conditions well and can work with them to practise preventive care.  The scheme represents a fundamental reform of the Republic\u2019s healthcare system that will see GPs taking on a key role in ensuring that individuals are kept healthy and avoid falling ill, instead of reactively caring for those who are already sick.  Healthier SG will kick off with those aged 60 and above. But patients with chronic illnesses aged 40 and above can sign up earlier through a pre-enrolment process.  On Saturday, 10 GPs working in the Toa Payoh area visited Care Corner\u2019s active ageing centre in Lorong 4 Toa Payoh to learn about the programmes that the social service agency provides, including daycare for seniors and specialised counselling services for them.  These are referred to as \u201csocial medicine\u201d by Care Corner Seniors Services senior group director Daniel Chien.  During the engagement session, the doctors were taught how to spot potential fall risks among seniors and how to help them avoid getting frail \u2013 an issue that is expected to grow markedly as Singapore\u2019s population ages. They were also briefed about local care networks that TTSH is building to bring GPs, community partners and various agencies together.  In a statement, Care Corner and TTSH said a fifth of the residents in Toa Payoh are above 65 years old, and almost one in three of these seniors lives alone. Hence, there is a pressing need to ensure that these seniors are better supported to lead healthier lives.  TTSH said it will work with other community partners in central Singapore to conduct similar engagement sessions for family doctors in places such as Ang Mo Kio, Serangoon and Kallang.  Adjunct Assistant Professor Jerome Goh, clinical director of the division for central health at TTSH, said: \u201cWith an ageing population, frailty, social isolation and disabilities become key social determinants for health. These cannot be managed using a medical model alone.\u201d  He added: \u201cWhat happens to patients after they leave the clinic is equally important \u2013 what they do in terms of adopting a healthy lifestyle, eating healthy and the social connections that they make.\u201d  Care Corner said collaborations between GPs and social service agencies can greatly benefit seniors by combining medical and social interventions.  For example, some senior patients may have difficulty managing their treatment, including forgetting appointments, being unsure of what medication to take, or lacking the motivation to take their pills.  In this case, social workers can work with GPs to provide follow-up support.  GPs can also refer seniors to Care Corner for social and exercise activities that can strengthen their support network and lower their risk of falls.  Care Corner said it plans to work closely with GPs in Toa Payoh to identify cases of neglect, abuse, social isolation and other mental health concerns among residents that may otherwise go unnoticed.  Another area that is being looked at is the management of patients with complex conditions who have been recently discharged from hospital.  The plan is to include GPs in joint case consultations conducted by TTSH, National Healthcare Group polyclinics and other partners, including Care Corner.  TTSH\u2019s Prof Goh said the hospital also wants to simplify how GPs refer patients for specialist treatment and other health and social programmes. He noted that it is also important for a feedback loop to be in place so that GPs are aware of what their patients have tried and what the outcome was.  TTSH will trial an electronic referral system later in May so that GPs can more easily make referrals to the hospital\u2019s specialists.  Using the system, GPs will be able to track the progress of the referral, and receive an update from the hospital\u2019s specialists on the patients\u2019 conditions.  In addition, the system will guide GPs on how to prescribe social support programmes for patients by prompting them on potential programmes and activities based on the doctor\u2019s assessment of the patient\u2019s conditions and interests.  Dr Kevin Loy, 54, who has been running a GP clinic in Toa Payoh Central for 18 years, said Saturday\u2019s engagement session was useful.  \u201cI was not aware that the social service network in Toa Payoh was so big,\u201d the family physician at Doctors Inc Medical Group told reporters.  He has referred patients to Care Corner before, but only in an ad hoc manner.  \u201cNow that I am more aware, I can make more accurate referrals for the various services,\u201d he said.",

Posting on his Twitter and Tiktok accounts on Friday, Mr Nas Rahman said he decided to take legal action after negotiations with the organisers, Live Nation and Go Live, fell through.  \u201cAfter a series of negotiations, both parties did not reach an agreement... I have filed a lawsuit against Live Nation and Go Live in the Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court,\u201d he said.  Mr Nas bought two tickets for RM488 when he found out that the popular group would be staging a concert at Bukit Jalil National Stadium as part of its Born Pink World Tour. The group is currently in Singapore and is performing on Saturday and Sunday. On March 4 \u2013 the day of the concert \u2013 he and his wife went to their designated seats, only to be shocked to see that one of the seats did not exist.  As a result, Mr Nas said he either had to stand or sit on a staircase throughout the two-hour show. After the concert, he tweeted: \u201cWho else went to Blackpink\u2019s concert and experienced the same fate as me? It was missing a seat... In the end, I had to either stand or sit on the staircase.\u201d Mr Nas was not the only one with issues at the concert. Some concertgoers also complained about missing seats despite paying for them, while others were frustrated that their view was obstructed by high walls and fences. Two days after the concert, Mr Nas, who has his own legal firm, issued a letter of demand to the organisers to ask for a refund and \u201csome\u201d compensation. However, Mr Nas said the two sides could not come to an agreement, leading to him filing a suit at the court, which handles civil claims of between RM100,000 and RM1 million. \u201cThe reason I believe action must be taken is not because of money,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I allow this issue to go on, it may happen to others in the future and I don\u2019t want it to happen to anyone again.\u201d\n Mr Nas added: \u201cIt does not matter if I win or lose the case.

    "context": "SINGAPORE - Researchers here may have pinpointed why a small group of people face a higher risk of cardiac complications after getting a shot of the Covid-19 vaccine. A study by researchers from Duke-NUS Medical School and others suggests that those with high baseline levels of RNASE2, an enzyme produced in the body that processes ribonucleic acid (RNA), may be more prone to heart issues following a jab of an mRNA vaccine.   The findings, published in clinical journal Med in April, are based on the case of a man who had developed symptoms similar to those of myocarditis \u2013 the inflammation of the heart muscle \u2013 after receiving a booster shot of Moderna\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine in October 2021.  The patient, described as a \u201cfit and healthy\u201d 42-year-old with no underlying illness or history of allergies, experienced muscle pain and tenderness at the injection site.  He had taken the mRNA-based Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for his first two shots.  Though he was well on the first day when he got his Moderna booster, he subsequently experienced worsening shortness of breath, and by the fourth day, was unable to move about without intermittent rest.  On the fifth day, he began experiencing chest pain caused by exertion. He was admitted to hospital the following day, and the man\u2019s electrocardiogram showed signs similar to those of patients with myocarditis and pericarditis, which is the inflammation of the lining around the heart. He was discharged on the eighth day without further intervention and was able to resume normal daily activities a week later.  The patient was a participant in a study of 200 people on the side effects of Covid-19 vaccines. It was funded by the National Medical Research Council.   His participation allowed researchers to compare blood samples before and after vaccination, and contrast the samples against specimens from 18 other people in the cohort to identify differences that could explain the cardiac complication observed.\u00a0 While the findings suggest the cardiac complication resulted due to a number of reasons, the main factor may have been the administering of mRNA vaccines to someone with a high level of RNASE2, researchers said.  The paper suggested that modifications to future vaccines could help prevent the overstimulation of RNA sensors, making such vaccines safer.  Other studies have already suggested a link between an overactive immune system and cardiac complications, said the lead investigator, Professor Ooi Eng Eong, deputy director of the emerging infectious diseases programme at Duke-NUS Medical School.  The paper admitted that a key limitation of the study was that its findings were based on a single case. However, Prof Ooi told The Straits Times that it would be unrealistic and uneconomical to recruit the hundreds of thousands of people needed for a clinical trial, given how rare occurrences of post-vaccination cardiac complications are. \u201cYou would literally have to recruit Singapore\u2019s entire population of more than five million people just to get those rare specimens,\u201d he said.  Speaking in Parliament on May 9, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said incidents of myocarditis after taking Covid-19 vaccines have been very rare, with 160 reports of myocarditis and pericarditis linked to the vaccines to date, out of more than 17 million doses administered. Two deaths from myocarditis \u2013 a 43-year-old woman and a 28-year-old man \u2013 have so far been linked to the Covid-19 vaccine in Singapore.  It ultimately comes down to ensuring that the benefits of the vaccines outweigh the risks, said Professor Paul Tambyah, principal investigator for the Integrated Innovations in Infectious Diseases project, which the study is a part of.  Given that the global coronavirus situation has stabilised since 2020 \u2013 the World Health Organisation declared an end to the global health emergency\u00a0on May 5 \u2013 this is the ideal time to be looking at making vaccines even safer, he said, pointing out that mRNA technology is being explored for vaccines for other diseases.

    "context": "SINGAPORE \u2013 Mail deliveries could be under threat amid a wide-ranging review by Singapore Post that will put the loss-making division under the microscope.  The review comes as the post and parcel unit reported its first ever annual loss, an outcome that is expected to continue given the decline in consumers using mail services. SingPost group chief executive Vincent Phang told a results briefing on Thursday that the review had only just begun, and he could not predict how long it would take. He added that the domestic postal business had been in relentless decline for some time, with profitability dropping year by year until it fell into the red for the first time in the past financial year that ended on March 31.  A spike in e-commerce volumes during the Covid-19 pandemic had helped mask the poor performance of the segment, but as economies reopened, revenues have returned to normal levels, making it difficult to compensate for the decline in the postal letter mail business. However, the good news for shareholders is that that domestic business is now being overtaken by SingPost\u2019s Australian and international divisions, which have grown to account for 86 per cent of the group\u2019s overall revenue. This shift in the revenue mix has prompted SingPost management to re-evaluate all its business segments to see if they still fit into the group\u2019s goal of becoming a global logistics player, not just a Singapore postal services company. Chief financial officer Vincent Yik told the briefing that Singapore\u2019s post and parcel segment used to account for more than 80 per cent of operating profit as recently as five or six years ago. That mix has reversed, with the group\u2019s international business now accounting for the lion\u2019s share. Mr Yik also pointed out that even if the group invested in its Singapore operations to the extent that it gained total market share, it would amount to revenue of only about $300 million to $400 million. In contrast, the potential in Australia remains considerable, given SingPost\u2019s barely 1 per cent share of the $100 billion logistics market Down Under. He also noted that while Singapore accounted for about 70 per cent of the group\u2019s fixed assets, the operations generated a rather small profit. Australia, on the other hand, accounts for the rest and makes up the majority of group earnings.  These fixed assets include infrastructure such as post offices, sorting machines, delivery vehicles and warehouses. SingPost intends to expand with this asset-light approach in mind, using 4PL (fourth-party logistics) technology, via a proprietary platform that it owns through its Australian unit, FMH. Essentially, the technology allows SingPost to play \u201cmatchmaker\u201d between clients who want items delivered and other logistics players who deliver these parcels.  The system gives clients the best prices available, while delivery companies can optimise the use of their trucks.   Mr Phang said SingPost was also looking to expand into South-east Asia, which has tremendous potential. SingPost recorded a 70.3 per cent fall in net profit to $24.7 million for the 12 months to March 31, down from $83.1 million a year earlier, due in large part to the faltering post and parcels unit. The unit recorded a full-year loss of $15.9 million, compared with a profit of $24.9 million in 2022, due to a decline in delivery volumes, coupled with costlier labour, utilities and fuel as well as higher conveyance expenses. SingPost said it expects the post and parcel business to \u201ccontinue to be loss-making\u201d this financial year. Overall revenue rose 12.4 per cent to a record $1.87 billion, due mainly to the group\u2019s new engine of growth, Australia.  SingPost\u00a0posted a 28 per cent drop in second-half earnings to $34.6 million from $48.1 million a year earlier, while revenue declined 2.2 per cent to $913.4 million. The board has recommended a final dividend of 0.4 cents per share. Including the interim dividend of 0.18 cents per share, SingPost\u2019s total dividend would amount to 0.58 cents per share, or about 40 per cent of its underlying profit.  SingPost shares closed unchanged at 51.5 cents on May 11.",

    "context": "HONG KONG \u2013 Houlihan Lokey, a US financial services firm that has featured in some of China\u2019s high-profile offshore restructurings, is betting on the country\u2019s US$4.7 trillion (S$6.2 trillion) onshore credit market as a new source of expansion.  Growth in the Asian restructuring business for Houlihan, which has advised on the debt reorganisation of major firms from China Evergrande Group to Luckin Coffee, will largely come from China\u2019s local market in the next six to 18 months, said Mr Brandon Gale, head of Asia restructuring.  Staffing there may double over the next two years from about eight employees currently, he added. \u201cRight now, most of our business is focused on dollar-denominated bonds in different geographies across the region. But we\u2019re working with Chinese companies on yuan-denominated debt issues as the goal over the next couple of years,\u201d he said at a recent media event.\u00a0 Houlihan\u2019s shifting focus towards China\u2019s domestic market follows a period of rapid expansion for global financial advisers in Asia as the country\u2019s property debt crisis unleashed a record wave of offshore defaults. Gearing up for more local opportunities also reflects the longstanding anticipation that as China\u2019s debt market matures, authorities will allow delinquencies and bankruptcies to become a norm. \u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re actively watching spaces like new energy vehicle or electric vehicles given the inundation of supply in the Chinese market,\u201d said Mr Gale.  Ms Sophia Xia, Houlihan\u2019s co-head of China restructuring, said: \u201cDefinitely these capital structures may not be sustainable but it\u2019s hard to say how quickly that will actually materialise, depending on the consumption demand and whether export to Europe or the Middle East can help these companies survive.\u201d  Patience is likely key to the success of local adventures for foreign financial advisers such as Houlihan, given China\u2019s onshore corporate debt market has stayed surprisingly uneventful since the pandemic started.  In contrast to its tolerance for surging offshore repayment failures, Beijing has used a combination of tools, from easy monetary policy to encouraging debt swaps or maturity extensions, to maintain domestic financial stability in the past three years.\u00a0 However, authorities have repeatedly stressed the need to develop a modern, well-functioning credit market that prices risks accurately and treats defaults as a routine.  Regulators have in recent years launched a campaign to meet that long-term goal, including overhauling China\u2019s notoriously lenient local credit rating industry, improving information disclosure and cracking down on bond issuance irregularities. \u00a0 To be sure, the onshore business will be \u201cvery different\u201d from Houlihan\u2019s offshore practice, said  Mr Gale. \u201cWhat we want to build is a China business done in a Chinese way,\u201d he added.  \u201cWe\u2019ve thought about branding, we\u2019ve thought about bringing in strategic investors onshore to help. We\u2019re still developing that model, and we may not be a controlling shareholder in that business when all the dust settles, but we\u2019ll see.\u201d BLOOMBERG",

    "context": "SINGAPORE \u2013 OCBC Bank on Wednesday posted\u00a0record first-quarter earnings amid higher interest rates, even as its chief executive cautioned that tighter financial conditions might slow global economic growth and elevate overall risks.  Singapore\u2019s second-largest lender saw its net profit rise 39 per cent year on year to $1.88 billion, beating the $1.74 billion estimate by analysts in a Refinitiv poll.  OCBC\u2019s net interest income rose 56 per cent to $2.34 billion amid a 5 per cent growth in average asset balances.  Net interest margin (NIM) \u2013 a key gauge of a lender\u2019s profitability \u2013 shot up by 75 basis points to 2.3 per cent following the US Federal Reserve\u2019s series of interest rate hikes. NIM compares the interest income a bank generates from credit products like loans and mortgages with the interest it pays out, such as to savings accounts or fixed deposits.  Meanwhile, OCBC\u2019s non-interest income slipped 11 per cent to $1.01 billion. It was weighed down by declining wealth management fees that were partly offset by a rise in trading income and net realised gains from the sale of investment securities.  Group chief executive Helen Wong said the bank is watchful of tighter financial conditions but confident of long-term prospects in its key Asian markets, adding that it has ample buffers for uncertainties and to pursue growth opportunities.  The bank set aside total allowances of $110 million for potential bad loans, up from $44 million a year ago, mainly due to higher general allowances. But the amount was lower than the $314 million set aside in the fourth quarter that included pre-emptive general provisions for the real estate sector.  OCBC has also been carrying out more stress tests on commercial real estate in developed markets like the United States and Britain amid contagion risks from recent US regional bank failures, Ms Wong told reporters.  Group chief financial officer Goh Chin Yee noted that the bank\u2019s commercial real estate loans are mostly made to network customers who have strong financials and track records.  Ms Wong said OCBC is also carrying out stress tests to assess the impact of the fresh round of property cooling measures in Singapore that might dampen mortgage sales. A bright spot comes from China\u2019s reopening, given that Greater China is a key region for OCBC outside Singapore. Ms Wong noted that the bank has started to see growth in cross-border flows as China opens up.  On the whole, growth in non-trade corporate loans and mortgages offset softer trade loans, while the wealth management business continued to attract net new money inflows, she added.  OCBC attracted $10 billion in such inflows in the first quarter \u2013 a \u201csizeable amount which we want to be able to maintain\u201d, said Ms Wong.  Meanwhile, the bank will have to contend with a likely peak in its margins as the Fed comes to the end of its rate-hiking cycle, as well as slowing loan growth amid the higher rates.  Ms Wong expects NIM to come in around 2.2 per cent in 2023 amid low- to mid-single-digit loan growth, comparable with her previous forecast for mid-single-digit growth.  \u201cThe loan book does not have a lot of potential to be repriced upwards, but the funding costs will continue to catch up \u2013 a natural phenomenon in a rapidly rising interest rate environment,\u201d she said, adding that rates have probably peaked, but that the Fed is unlikely to make any cuts in 2023.  There is also the risk of non-performing loans rising in 2023 amid the high rates, she said, even as the bank\u2019s non-performing loan ratio improved to 1.1 per cent in the first quarter versus 1.4 per cent a year ago.  OCBC, which pays dividends half-yearly, saw its first-quarter earnings grow by 44 per cent compared with the previous quarter. A rebound in wealth management activities drove a 14 per cent increase in fee income to $453 million and reversed declines over the past year.  Ms Wong said investor sentiment recovered somewhat in the first quarter, but the momentum has yet to bounce back strongly due to volatility in the financial markets.  But the net new money inflows are encouraging, she said.  \u201cEventually, as investment sentiment comes back, we can offer products and utilise this increase in our AUM (assets under management).\u201d  OCBC\u2019s numbers wrap up local banks\u2019 earnings season. The net profit of Singapore and South-east Asia\u2019s largest lender DBS climbed by 43 per cent to $2.57 billion, while UOB\u2019s rose by 67 per cent to $1.5 billion.  OCBC shares closed 0.57 per cent higher at $12.32 on Wednesday. ",

Workers who joined on or before March 31 will get the salary bump, Mr Forrest Li said in a memo to staff on Monday seen by Bloomberg News. Mr Li said Sea has reached \u201cself-sufficiency\u201d as its cash balance is now increasing rather than shrinking every quarter, a goal it achieved months ahead of a target set last year. The across-the-board hike marks a reversal from just a couple of quarters ago, when Mr Li surprised investors with a companywide salary freeze and deep layoffs.  The Singapore-based company\u2019s about-face may presage a broader recovery for the region\u2019s technology sector, which like elsewhere has endured deep job losses and downward-spiralling valuations after a Covid-19-era online spending boom sputtered out in 2022. Sea, owner of e-commerce platform Shopee and gaming arm Garena, reported its first quarterly net profit in March, about 14 years after its founding.  The company took brutal measures in 2022 to convince investors of its profit-making ability, including cutting thousands of jobs, retreating from major markets and slashing over US$700 million (S$927 million) from its quarterly sales and marketing expenses. In his 1,300-word missive, sent out about a week before the company is set to report its next earnings, Mr Li, who is also Sea\u2019s chief executive, addressed head-on the \u201cpainful\u201d struggles that the company went through during its turnaround effort.  Sea was at one point in 2020 the world\u2019s best-performing stock, buoyed by hopes that the company would embody South-east Asia\u2019s nascent e-commerce and entertainment boom. But the company then lost about US$160 billion in market value since a peak in October 2021 on questions about its money-making prospects and a global decline in tech stocks. \u201cThis past year was probably the most difficult period in the history of our company,\u201d Mr Li said, describing the difficult decisions including layoffs the management had to take to navigate a worsening business environment. Last year, Sea cut about 3,500 people from its workforce, according to its annual report. In September, members of the leadership team said they would forgo their salaries and tighten company expense policies until the company reaches self-sufficiency. \u201cThe external environment is still a challenging one,\u201d Mr Li said.  \u201cWith self-sufficiency, we have a foundation for strong growth once again.\u201d BLOOMBERG",

    "context": "SINGAPORE \u2013 Binance restarted withdrawals of Bitcoin after citing congestion on the token\u2019s blockchain for two halts in less than 12 hours, suspensions that weighed on cryptocurrency markets. It said higher fees have been applied to pending transactions so they get picked up by Bitcoin miners \u2013 the computer rigs that operate the network. Withdrawals had been down for more than two hours on Monday in Asia. \u201cTo prevent a similar recurrence in the future, our fees have been adjusted,\u201d it said. \u201cWe will continue to monitor on-chain activity and adjust accordingly if needed.\u201d Binance had also halted Bitcoin withdrawals on Sunday for about 90 minutes, blaming congestion on the token\u2019s blockchain. Data from CryptoQuant showed that the platform saw its highest net daily outflow of Bitcoin \u2013 a net 175,646 tokens \u2013 on May 7.\u00a0 Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency by market value, fell as much as 3.1 per cent before paring some of the drop, and was trading at about US$28,230 as at 12.05pm in Singapore. An index of the biggest 100 digital assets posted a similar decline. Binance is by far the largest exchange in the digital asset sector after the collapse of rival FTX last year. Volumes on Binance had exceeded US$6 billion (S$8 billion) in the past 24 hours, five times as much as the next nearest platform OKX, according to data from CoinGecko. Earlier this year, Bitcoin developer Casey Rodarmor released a protocol, called Ordinals, that helped people mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the network for the first time. This boosted transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. NFTs or digital collectibles are often based on Ethereum, crypto\u2019s most important commercial highway. Their emergence on the Bitcoin network represents a new application of a blockchain that is better known for its store-of-value and payment functions.\n Ordinals led to a \u201cmassive run-up in network fees and congestion\u201d, said Mr Hayden Hughes, co-founder of social trading platform Alpha Impact. Binance in its tweets also suggested that customer funds were safe.\u00a0 Last year\u2019s crypto crash and bankruptcies, like that of FTX, undermined confidence in digital asset platforms, and scepticism continues to linger over the industry. Binance and rivals subsequently redoubled efforts to try to dispel worries about whether they have sufficient reserves.  At the moment, the withdrawal fees charged by exchanges are not sufficient to cover the fees charged by miners, said Mr Stefan von Haenisch, head of sales trading at OSL SG in Singapore. \u201cThe queue of transactions pending verification for inclusion in the blockchain has experienced significant growth in recent days, causing an increase in transaction fees and confirmation times,\u201d he said.

    "context": "BEIJING \u2013 China\u2019s largest trade fair was meant to be a triumphant return for the world\u2019s biggest manufacturing nation after three years of being mostly online. Instead, the mood was downbeat as factories grappled with a slowing global economy and a scarcity of US buyers. The semi-annual event, known as the Canton Fair, kicked off on April 15, just as Chinese officials embarked on a charm offensive to lure foreign investors back after three years of zero-Covid policies that prevented in-person visits. However, this year, only US$25.1 billion (S$33.2 billion) in transactions were agreed upon, according to a statement on Saturday after the end of the fair, which saw thousands of vendors displaying goods ranging from toys to electronics in a mammoth convention centre in the southern city of Guangzhou. This is well below 2008\u2019s peak of US$38 billion or the pre-pandemic level of US$30 billion in 2019. Despite an unexpected surge in March, China\u2019s exports are expected to drop in 2023 after hitting a record last year as rising prices and interest rates, high inventory levels and the war in Ukraine act as brakes on consumer demand in the United States and Europe. While there were crowds of exhibitors and overseas visitors at the fair this spring, buyers from Western nations were scarce, with many sellers commenting on their absence.  Miland Houseware, a producer of anti-slip mats mainly for American and European customers like Walmart and Costco Wholesale, had few of its target clients visit the company\u2019s booth, said David, a sales manager who declined to give his last name. \u201cDemand is really weak in the US now,\u201d he said, something that was also apparent at a housewares fair he attended in Chicago earlier this year. \u201cOur big clients are not placing new orders as they said they are still using up inventory.\u201d  The employees of a manufacturer of high-end bathroom fixtures were eating lunch together in their booth on the day Bloomberg reporters visited.  \u201cThis would not have happened in past years,\u201d said Ms Abby Lin, a saleswoman for a Dongguan-based factory that makes tissue boxes and soap dispensers. \u201cIt is only because we don\u2019t have visitors at all.\u201d While the largest number of foreign buyers were from Russia and the Middle East, most people at the fair were working for local trading firms that purchase for smaller international customers or for the domestic Chinese market, she said.  \u201cNo one is placing orders; they are just checking on the prices,\u201d she said. \u201cI do hope the global economy gets better soon \u2013 hopefully later this year. Nothing else can improve the situation.\u201d China\u2019s factories have struggled to boost prices and fully extricate themselves from last year\u2019s Covid-19-induced production slump, leading to producer price deflation and falling profits for industrial firms.  Even if demand picks up, some sellers are concerned that buyers will move on to products made in other regions. After China\u2019s Covid-19 restrictions last year crimped supply chains and complicated production and delivery schedules, many companies started to diversify their operations. The number of \u201cMade in Vietnam\u201d and \u201cMade in Mexico\u201d labels on goods in Walmart and Dollar Tree stores is noticeably higher now than in 2019, when \u201cMade in China\u201d was everywhere, said Mr Johnson Wang, founder of a Ningbo-based housewares manufacturing and trading company that mainly sells in the US.  Politics is exacerbating the situation. On a recent trip to the US, some big customers told Mr Wang they will not place new orders with Chinese suppliers amid intensifying geopolitical tensions, information that led him to look for new factories in Vietnam. \u201cI will not expand my supplier partner network in China any more,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no point in doing that if your clients are going away. Vietnam will be my new focus.\u201d  It is not just the US. Some of Mr Lorne Aranoff\u2019s Canadian customers said they will prefer to order from places other than China. Mr Aranoff, a restaurant supplier, was headed to Vietnam after Guangzhou to investigate manufacturers.   However, it will not be easy to replace or replicate all the elements available in China, where extensive supply chains and reliable relationships have been built over the course of years.   \u201cPeople are fooling themselves if they think they can find what they can find here elsewhere,\u201d said Mr Rob Siwiec, a buyer for Dollarama in Canada, who was back at the fair to reconnect with suppliers after three years away. He also planned to travel to other parts of the country for factory visits.  \u201cThe competitive advantage that China has is still very strong,\u201d he said. BLOOMBERG",

    "context": "When an elderly parent falls or a child experiences stomach cramps or high fever, most caregivers would rush them down to the accident and emergency (A&E) department of the nearest hospital.\u00a0 However, going to the A&E department can potentially mean a long waiting time before you get to see a doctor and get a diagnosis.\u00a0 Take the children\u2019s emergency department at KK Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital and National University Hospital, for instance. About 80 per cent of its patients last year did not require hospitalisation and were discharged after their visits, according to the Ministry of Health. A contributing factor for the long wait times at the emergency department is the lack of awareness of where else to seek medical attention, says Dr Sanjeev Shanker, emergency medicine specialist and family physician at StarMed Specialist Centre, conveniently situated above the Farrer Park MRT station.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019ve never had an option other than general practitioners (GP) and A&E for the past 50 years. People go to the GPs for minor conditions like mild respiratory infections and the management of chronic conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure. For everything else, they rush to the A&E,\u201d he adds.\u00a0 Besides GPs and hospitals, there are alternative options, such as urgent care facilities, to seek medical care. Urgent care typically refers to conditions that require early attention but are not life-threatening. In 2019, a public hospital reclassified their A&E department as an Urgent Care Centre after a renovation\u00a0to focus on non-emergency procedures. Since then, a few more urgent care centres have been established in Singapore, one of them being StarMed Specialist Centre\u2019s urgent care centre, which opened three months ago.\u00a0 Dr Sanjeev says that at StarMed\u2019s urgent care centre, patients wait an average of 15 minutes to see a doctor. But when should you go to an urgent care centre instead of the A&E department at a hospital?\u00a0 He says: \u201cThink about your condition and ask yourself: Are you concerned about something that is going to kill you or are you in danger of losing your limbs or vision? If the answer is no, then Urgent Care is an excellent option.\u201d\u00a0 Non-life threatening conditions that do not warrant a visit to the A&E department include sprains, fractures, cuts and abrasions, Covid-19 with mild symptoms, food poisoning, allergic reactions, stomach pain, among others.\u00a0 For young children who develop a sudden fever or after minor falls, there is also no need for parents to send them to the hospital.\u00a0 Dr Sanjeev says: \u201cMajority of these cases are not urgent. If the child has mild symptoms, the doctor will most likely give them medications and send them home. But they would have waited six hours for that.\u201d\u00a0 However, if your child is having a seizure, is unconscious or has been involved in a major accident, then go to the emergency department at once.\u00a0 For the elderly, common symptoms such as abdominal cramps and bloatedness do not usually warrant a visit to the A&E department, says Dr Sanjeev. It is the same with fever \u2013 caregivers tend to panic when their parents have fever, thinking that it may be caused by a serious condition such as pneumonia.\u00a0 These symptoms can be investigated with a blood test and X-ray at an urgent care centre.\u00a0 If an elderly person has a fall and is still awake and alert, you can take them to urgent care to get scanned, shares Dr Sanjeev. However, if they are barely conscious, confused and cannot eat or show symptoms of a stroke, it\u2019s best to take them to the A&E department immediately.\u00a0 Those who go to an urgent care centre will be able to receive appropriate medical attention and care for a range of conditions. StarMed's urgent care centre\u2019s doctors and nurses are trained in emergency medicine as well.\u00a0 Patients can get diagnosed, assessed quickly and even get admitted to StarMed\u2019s ward straight away for a short observation, if required.\u00a0 The centre is also equipped to do tests such as X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computerised tomography (CT) scan, and patients can also undergo blood tests, scopes, receive intravenous medication, and even have day surgery done. Similar to how an A&E functions, if a patient needs to be referred to another specialist, there is a panel of consultants from a wide variety of specialties such as cardiology, internal medicine, general surgery, gastroenterology, ophthalmology, orthopaedic and paediatrics, who can come down to assess the patient at the urgent care centre, or see them the next day in the outpatient clinics Are you concerned about something that is going to kill you or are you in danger of losing your limbs or vision? If the answer is no, then Urgent Care is an excellent option. StarMed also has nine patient observation rooms if patients need to be warded for short periods of observation. Cases that may need observation include food poisoning, kidney stones and head injury. The aim is to treat patients and get them home as soon as they are able to.\u00a0 \u201cWe have a team of dedicated and experienced healthcare professionals to attend to you, diagnose and provide you the most efficient and effective treatment so you can get home as quickly as possible. We want to make healthcare simple for you,\u201d says Dr Sanjeev.\u00a0 If prolonged treatment or hospitalisation is required, doctors at StarMed can arrange transfers for patients to receive follow-ups at public and private hospitals.\u00a0 \u00a0 StarMed Specialist Centre\u2019s urgent care centre, at 12 Farrer Park Station Road, is open from 8 to 12am daily.\u00a0",

    "context": "LONDON - Covid-19 no longer represents a global health emergency, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Friday, a major step towards the end of the pandemic that has killed millions of people, disrupted the global economy and ravaged communities.  The WHO\u2019s emergency committee met on Thursday and recommended the UN agency declare an end to the public health emergency of international concern, which has been in place for more than three years. \u201cIt\u2019s therefore with great hope that I declare Covid-19 over as a global health emergency,\u201d said WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, adding that the end of the emergency did not mean Covid-19 was over as a global health threat. The WHO\u2019s emergency committee first declared that Covid-19 represented its highest level of alert on Jan 30, 2020. The status helps focus international attention on a health threat, as well as bolstering collaboration on vaccines and treatments. Lifting it is a sign of the progress the world has made in these areas, but Covid-19 is here to stay, the WHO said. \u201cCovid has changed the world, and it has changed us. And that\u2019s the way it should be. If we go back to how things were before Covid-19, we will have failed to learn our lessons, and failed our future generations,\u201d said Dr Tedros.  During a lengthy conference call to brief the press on the decision, some WHO members became emotional as they urged countries to reflect on lessons learned during the pandemic. \u201cWe can\u2019t forget those fire pyres. We can\u2019t forget the graves that were dug. None of us up here will forget them,\u201d said WHO\u2019s technical lead on Covid-19 Maria Van Kerkhove. The death rate has slowed from a peak of more than 100,000 people per week in January 2021 to just over 3,500 in the week to April 24, according to WHO data.  Worldwide, as at Wednesday, the disease had officially claimed more than 6.9 million lives and sickened over 765 million others, according to the WHO, but Dr Tedros said on Friday that at least 20 million people were estimated to have been killed by Covid-19 \u2013 nearly three times the official number.  To make up for inconsistently collected or incomplete national tolls, researchers have compared the number of excess deaths worldwide since 2020 to the pre-pandemic figures. For 2020 and 2021, nearly 15 million excess deaths were due to Covid-19, either from the disease itself or indirectly through its impact on society, the WHO said previously.\u00a0 In many parts of the world, testing has dwindled dramatically, and people have largely stopped wearing masks. In some countries, mask-wearing mandates have resumed during Covid-19 outbreaks. The WHO published a plan this week advising countries on how to live with Covid-19 long-term. Covid-19 will continue to challenge health systems worldwide long term, including long COVID, infectious disease experts say. \u201cNo one should take (this) to mean Covid-19 is no longer a problem,\u201d said Mark Woolhouse, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh. \u201cIt is still a significant public health problem and looks likely to remain one for the foreseeable future.\u201d Last week, Mr Patrick Gerland, chief of the UN\u2019s population estimates section, told AFP that it was still waiting on data about 2022 excess deaths from India, which may have been the country with the highest number of fatalities. The WHO does not declare the beginning or end of pandemics, although it did start using the term for Covid-19 in March 2020.\u00a0 In 2022, US President Joe Biden said the pandemic was over. Like a number of other countries, the world\u2019s biggest economy has begun dismantling its domestic state of emergency for Covid-19, meaning it will stop paying for things such as vaccines.  Other regions have taken similar steps. The European Union said in April 2022 that the emergency phase of the pandemic was over, and the WHO\u2019s African head, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, said in December that it was time to move to routine management of Covid-19 across the continent. Ending the emergency could mean that international collaboration or funding efforts are also brought to an end or shift in focus, although many have already adapted as the pandemic receded in different regions.

    "context": "SINGAPORE \u2013 Hyflux\u2019s founder and former chief executive Olivia Lum was hit with three more charges in State Court on Friday for violations of the Companies Act, in relation to her alleged failure to exercise diligence in the discharge of her duties as a director. Lum, 61, who now faces a total of six charges, is out on bail of $100,000.  In addition, Hyflux independent director Lee Joo Hai, who left Singapore before investigations commenced, was charged on March 13, 2023 with one count of violating the Securities and Futures Act.  This came after he was arrested in Malaysia on March 12 with assistance from the Royal Malaysia Police, the authorities said in a joint statement on Friday. Lee is accused of negligence in relation to Hyflux\u2019s intentional failure to disclose information relating to the Tuaspring Integrated Water and Power Project when disclosure was required under the Singapore Exchange Listing Rules. If convicted, Lee faces a jail term of up to seven years, a fine of up to $250,000, or both. The Commercial Affairs Department, Singapore Police Force, Monetary Authority of Singapore and Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (Acra) also announced three fresh charges against Lum on Friday. She was charged over Hyflux\u2019s omission to disclose, in its 2017 third-quarter financial statements, US$33.5 million (S$44.7 million) worth of bank deposits that it had undertaken not to withdraw as restricted bank balances. She was also charged over the company\u2019s omission to disclose, in its financial statements for the year ended Dec 31, 2017, US$33.5 million worth of bank deposits that Hyflux had undertaken not to withdraw as restricted bank balances. In the third new charge, Lum was charged over Hyflux\u2019s omission to disclose in the 2018 first-quarter financial statements, US$47.5 million worth of bank deposits that Hyflux had undertaken not to withdraw as restricted bank balances.  If convicted, Lum faces a jail term of up to 12 months or a fine of up to $5,000, on each of the three new counts. Lum was first charged in November 2022 with three counts of violations of the Securities and Futures Act and the Companies Act. Former chief financial officer Cho Wee Peng and four former board members of Hyflux were also charged in 2022 with violations of the Securities and Futures Act. The charges came 17 months after the water treatment firm was approved to be wound up, which likely left about 34,000 investors of perpetual securities and preference shares, who had sunk in a combined $900 million, with nothing. In November 2022, Lum was charged with consenting to Hyflux omitting information relating to Tuaspring, when disclosure was required under Singapore Exchange (SGX) listing rules.  According to the charge, she consented to intentionally failing to notify SGX that the Tuaspring project was Hyflux\u2019s expansion into a new business of selling electricity, and that the plant\u2019s profitability was contingent on electricity sales revenue, which was projected to make up a significant proportion of its overall revenue. If convicted, she faces jail of up to seven years, a fine of up to $250,000, or both.  Lum was also charged over Hyflux\u2019s omission to disclose the information about Tuaspring in the 2011 offer information statement issued for the offer of $200 million, 6 per cent preference shares on April 13, 2011. If convicted, she faces jail of up to two years, a maximum fine of $150,000, or both. She was charged with an offence under the Companies Act over her failure to ensure Hyflux\u2019s compliance with accounting standards when it disclosed its statements for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2017, at a Hyflux annual general meeting in 2018. This included failing to disclose the breach of a subsidiary\u2019s loan agreement that permitted its lenders to demand accelerated repayment. If convicted, she faces a fine of up to $50,000. On Friday, the authorities announced that the Public Accountants Oversight Committee, which administers Acra\u2019s practice monitoring programme under the Accountants Act, has issued orders against Hyflux\u2019s auditors from KPMG in relation to the financial statements for the financial years ended between 2013 and 2017.

    "context": "SINGAPORE \u2013 Alibaba Group Holding\u2019s international online shopping unit is exploring a US initial public offering (IPO) as it weighs options to spur growth for the business that includes major e-commerce brands Lazada and AliExpress. The firm is in the early stages of consideration and the IPO\u2019s size has yet to be determined, according to people familiar with the matter. The business group is in talks with banks that could potentially help prepare for the IPO next year, said one of the people. Alibaba\u2019s US-listed shares rose 1.2 per cent in New York trading.  The unit, which competes with rivals such as Amazon.com in markets outside China, is one of six parts that Alibaba is splitting into. Valuations for the international business units vary: Morgan Stanley in March priced \u201cinternational retail\u201d units including Lazada and Trendyol at roughly US$29 billion (S$38.5 billion), while an analyst report by China International Capital Corp in the same month valued the firm\u2019s international division at about US$39 billion.  In recent quarters, however, growth has been volatile in the face of global recessionary fears. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts estimated that the unit could be worth at least US$19 billion provided it cut costs. If it goes ahead, the Alibaba unit would join a number of high-profile Chinese firms, including fast-fashion leader Shein, seeking to tap US capital even as tensions rise between the world\u2019s two largest economies. A listing in the United States could help the business \u2013 formally Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group, or IDCG \u2013 attract global investors wary of putting money directly into China. Alibaba in March unveiled plans to break up its empire into units such as e-commerce, logistics and the cloud, with each business potentially exploring fund-raising and an IPO at an appropriate time. The company will consider gradually giving up control of some of the businesses, chief executive officer Daniel Zhang said at the time, but he declined to specify a timeline for any IPOs. IDCG includes South-east Asian online mall Lazada; AliExpress, popular in Russia, Latin America and parts of Europe; Trendyol in Turkey; Daraz in South Asia; and business-to-business marketplace Alibaba.com.  In the final three months of 2022, the combined orders of Lazada, AliExpress, Trendyol and Daraz grew 3 per cent from a year earlier, led by Trendyol. The international unit accounted for roughly US$9.5 billion or 7 per cent of Alibaba\u2019s revenue in the last fiscal year and is headed by Mr Jiang Fan, former president of Alibaba\u2019s domestic online retail businesses Taobao and Tmall. Other parts of Alibaba\u2019s empire have already begun moving ahead with spin-offs. Cainiao Network Technology, the logistics arm of Alibaba, and Freshippo, its grocery chain, have started preparations with banks for IPOs in Hong Kong. Deliberations around an IPO are very preliminary and the situation may change, the people said. IDCG said in response to queries from Bloomberg that there is no IPO plan currently. Alibaba has in the past explored splitting off Lazada. The unit, bought in stages from Rocket Internet, is considered one of the Chinese firm\u2019s most high-profile international brands. It competes with Amazon and Sea\u2019s Shopee in South-east Asian markets such as Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore. In 2022, Alibaba discussed raising at least US$1 billion for Lazada before calling off negotiations with potential investors when talks bogged down over its valuation. It had aimed to secure the funding as a precursor to a spin-off. Alibaba has since mothballed the fund raising and injected additional funds into the company instead. BLOOMBERG",

    "context": "HONG KONG \u2013 FedEx is planning on moving its Asia-Pacific regional headquarters to Singapore from Hong Kong, in another blow to the city\u2019s image as an international business hub.  In an e-mailed statement, FedEx said it will consolidate some Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa headquarters functions in Singapore \u201cto connect all of our operations in this region with greater speed and agility\u201d.  The company said it will retain leadership roles and a \u201csignificant\u201d presence in Hong Kong. The courier has 35,000 workers in the region and provides services in more than 100 countries, FedEx said. The courier plans to relocate some of its Hong Kong-based executives, including regional president Kawal Preet, to Singapore, according to a person who declined to be identified because the details are private. FedEx\u2019s Hong Kong employees were told that the management team will move in September, the person added.  The American company will still keep an office in Hong Kong along with most Hong Kong business-related staff, and it is also considering moving some non-essential roles to Malaysia or India to cut costs, one person said.  Fewer than 15 per cent of the positions in Hong Kong will move to Singapore, FedEx said. The office will \u201ccontinue to provide vital support\u201d for the region, according to the company.  The move may fuel concern that multinational companies\u2019 confidence in Hong Kong is waning, particularly after years of political turmoil and Covid-19 restrictions.  Hong Kong was at the centre of the United States-China trade disputes in 2019 as Beijing\u2019s tightening grip over the financial hub \u2013 in response to months of social unrest \u2013 triggered sanctions from Washington. The city\u2019s fortunes fell further during the pandemic, when tough travel curbs drove capital, companies and workers to countries such as Singapore.  Even after Hong Kong reopened earlier this year as China scrapped its zero-Covid policy, its logistics industry has continued to suffer from a decline in global trade, rising inflation and increasing interest rates. Container processing in March fell about 10 per cent year on year.  While air cargo volumes rose about 6 per cent the same month, this was mainly due to the low base last year amid Covid-19-related supply chain disruptions, Hong Kong\u2019s airport authority said in a statement last month.  While Hong Kong remains the world\u2019s busiest air cargo port, it has lost regional relevance with the rise of nearby mainland Chinese logistics hubs including Guangzhou, where FedEx has an operations centre, and Shenzhen. The freight giant also shut its Hong Kong pilot crew base during the height of the pandemic.   FedEx itself suffered from increasing scrutiny from China in 2019 after Huawei Technologies said documents it asked to be shipped from Japan to China were diverted to the US instead without authorisation.  In a separate incident, FedEx said it rejected a package containing a Huawei phone being sent to America from Britain by mistake.  Following the incidents, the Chinese authorities targeted the company in a series of events, such as investigating a package containing a gun delivered by FedEx to a company in China and seizing a package containing knives to be shipped to Hong Kong.  A pilot for the company was temporarily detained in 2019 in Guangzhou after the authorities found hundreds of air-gun pellets in his luggage prior to boarding a commercial flight to Hong Kong. FedEx is also embarking on a sweeping restructuring, seeking to cut US$4 billion (S$5.3 billion) in costs as it faces falling demand and trails its rival, United Parcel Service, on profit margins. It aims to merge its express package business and its ground unit into a \u201cfully integrated air-ground network\u201d by 2024.  It has also trimmed global officer and director jobs by more than 10 per cent, put workers on furlough, reduced cargo flights and parked some planes. BLOOMBERG",

    "context": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Ford Motor has reduced prices of its Mustang Mach-E electric vehicle (EV) and is reopening orders. This is the second time it has given discounts this year after a series of price cuts by rival Tesla. Ford, the No. 2 US automaker, said on Tuesday that it was also increasing the range for its standard-range battery models as it increases production of the electric crossover sport utility vehicle in the second half of 2023.   Prices for most Mach-E models were cut by US$3,000 (S$4,000) or US$4,000 depending on the version, or by as much as 7.8 per cent, Ford said. The price of the Mustang Mach-E Premium rear-wheel drive version dropped from US$50,995 to US$46,995.  Ford chief executive Jim Farley told analysts that Ford did not intend to pursue EV sales volume \u201cat any cost\u201d, saying: \u201cWe are not going to price just to gain market share.\u201d    His stance contrasts with that of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who said in April that Tesla could cut profit margins on vehicle sales to zero and make up the difference through sales of software-enabled services. Ford shares closed down 2.2 per cent at US$11.80 on Tuesday and fell 1.5 per cent in after-hours trading after it reported first-quarter earnings.  In April, the federal EV tax credit for the Mustang Mach-E fell by half to US$3,750 from US$7,500 after new battery sourcing rules took effect.  Mustang Mach-E US sales fell 20 per cent in the first three months of 2023. Ford said on Tuesday that shipments of the EV were limited in the first three months of the year in order for Ford to make industrial changes that would nearly double manufacturing capacity.    In January, Ford cut prices of the Mustang Mach-E by as much as US$5,900 per vehicle after hiking prices in August by US$3,000 to about US$8,000, citing supply chain issues and higher material costs.  Ford said all standard-range models would now be powered by lithium iron phosphate batteries, which allow vehicles to gain an additional 45 units of horsepower and improve the targeted range estimates by the Environmental Protection Agency.     On Monday, Tesla raised prices by up to US$290 in Canada, China, Japan and the US after it had slashed prices on its top-selling vehicles since the start of the year.   The hike was Tesla\u2019s first on its two top-selling models at the same time in multiple markets, although prices across its line-up are much lower than in January after a round of discounts.

    "context": "SINGAPORE \u2013 Consumer electronics giant Dyson will open a factory in Tuas to manufacture next-generation batteries for the company\u2019s new products, describing the move as \u201cthe most significant investment in advanced manufacturing in the firm\u2019s history\u201d. The new facility, which will span 247,000 sq ft, or the equivalent of 53 basketball courts, will be completed this year and is expected to be fully operational by 2025. It is part of a broader move to ramp up software, artificial intelligence (AI) and product development globally that will see Dyson double its manufacturing footprint worldwide.  The Singapore-headquartered company will also invest in new sites in Britain and the Philippines that focus on research and development (R&D), among other capabilities.  The latest developments are part of an ongoing \u00a32.75 billion (S$4.6 billion) five-year investment plan, said Dyson on Wednesday.  Founder James Dyson said: \u201cSoftware, connectivity, AI and proprietary new technology batteries will power the next generation of Dyson technology.  \u201cJust like our long-term investments in pioneering digital electric motor technology, Dyson\u2019s next-generation batteries will drive a major revolution in the performance and sustainability of Dyson\u2019s machines.\u201d  While the company did not disclose the investment value of Singapore\u2019s new battery plant, a spokesman said: \u201cThis investment is part of our ongoing $1.5 billion commitment to our future in Singapore.\u201d The high-tech plant will produce proprietary batteries that will be smaller, lighter, more sustainable and more energy-dense than the ones available today, said the spokesman. Dyson started developing in-house batteries more than a decade ago. \u201cOur advanced manufacturing expansion in Singapore will enable Dyson to bring entirely new battery technology to market,\u201d said Dyson chief executive Roland Krueger, who also gave a nod to Singapore\u2019s highly skilled workforce of engineers and scientists, along with a supportive government.  Dyson currently operates an advanced manufacturing facility in western Singapore that produces its motors. Plans for the existing Singapore advanced manufacturing facility remain unchanged, the spokesman said.  Apart from Singapore, Dyson will also be making a \u00a3166 million investment in the Philippines and another \u00a3100 million in Britain for new R&D campuses, or what it calls \u201ctechnology centres\u201d. The Philippines site is expected to be operational by the first half of 2024 and would bring together its research, development and advanced motor manufacturing capabilities under one roof. It is located in Santo Tomas, Batangas, some 60km south of capital Manila. As part of this investment, Dyson aims to recruit another\u00a0400\u00a0engineers in the Philippines, along with more than 50 graduate engineers, who are expected to join the team later in 2023.  They will focus their research on software, AI, robotics, fluid dynamics and hardware electronics, areas of study that are critical to developing the company\u2019s products. In Britain, the new Bristol centre will be home to software and AI engineers working on a pipeline of products that stretches a decade into the future, as well as the commercial and e-commerce teams for Britain and Ireland. This follows Dyson\u2019s investment in 2022 in a centre in Wiltshire that is focused on wearables and robotics.  The company said its commitment to Bristol reflects the city\u2019s position as an international hub for software and digital skills, and will drive recruitment of the best qualified people from both Britain and abroad. Dyson employs more than 14,000 staff in 80 countries, with about 1,400 in Singapore.  The company reported a 13.3 per cent drop in Ebitda to \u00a31.3 billion in 2022, compared with \u00a31.5 billion in 2021, as rising costs and expenditure hit operating profit. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. Besides its operations in Singapore, the Philippines and Britain, Dyson also has R&D and manufacturing set-ups in China. It also has product development and other functions in Malaysia, whereas Poland is home to its software, information technology, finance, and its people and business enablement teams.",

    "context": "NEW YORK - Morgan Stanley is preparing a fresh round of job cuts amid a renewed focus on expenses as recession fears delay a rebound in dealmaking. Senior managers are discussing plans to eliminate about 3,000 jobs from the global workforce by the end of this quarter, according to people with knowledge of the matter.  That would amount to roughly 5 per cent of workers, excluding financial advisers and staff supporting them within the wealth management division. The banking and trading group is expected to shoulder many of the reductions, one of the people said.  A spokesman for Morgan Stanley, which employs about 82,000 people, declined to comment.  The cuts come just months after the firm trimmed about 2 per cent of its workforce.  Wall Street\u2019s biggest banks offered few reasons for cheer while reporting first-quarter results after seeing their fees from helping companies with takeovers and raising capital \u2013 a proxy for the economy\u2019s health \u2013 slump over the past year.  The United States Federal Reserve\u2019s desire to curb inflation through rate hikes and the ensuing regional banking tumult have further damped activity. Chief executive James Gorman said in April that underwriting and mergers activity has been subdued, and that he does not expect a rebound before the second half of 2023, or 2024.  Mr Ken Jacobs, who runs\u00a0financial advisory firm Lazard, echoed the sentiments as he forecast that the industry\u2019s doldrums will last for the rest of 2023. Lazard will eliminate 10 per cent of its workforce, the firm said last week.  Mr Jacobs noted that dealmaker pay has surged in recent years as junior bankers demanded higher salaries amid a boom.  It is harder to roll back those raises, while costs for travel, entertainment and information services have soared as well, he said. In the first quarter, Morgan Stanley\u2019s profit fell from a year earlier, dragged down by a drop-off in dealmaking, with a 32 per cent decline in its merger advisory and 22 per cent slump in its equity underwriting business.  Analysts are forecasting that revenue from banking fees will be in line with 2022\u2019s haul \u2013 which was roughly half the US$10.3 billion (S$13.8 billion) that the bank pulled in during 2021\u2019s dealmaking frenzy. Job cuts across finance have returned since the Covid-19 pandemic, when banks held off on reductions to give employees stability and then fought for talent as deals picked up.  But as that frenzy cooled, expenses have become the focus, with several banks unveiling plans to lay off staff. Morgan Stanley in December cut roughly 1,600 jobs. Then Goldman Sachs Group eliminated about 3,200 positions in January in one of its biggest cuts ever.  On Monday, Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said her company is willing to make adjustments to staffing levels at its investment bank. BLOOMBERG",

    "context": "SINGAPORE \u2013 DBS Group Holdings on Tuesday reported record quarterly earnings driven by higher interest rates, but flagged that profit margins from the high rates have peaked.  Still, business momentum is expected to remain healthy, with \u201csome pockets of moderation\u201d, chief executive Piyush Gupta said at a briefing on the bank\u2019s results.  Net interest margin (NIM) \u2013 a key gauge of a bank\u2019s profitability \u2013 compares the interest income it generates from credit products like loans and\u00a0mortgages, with the outgoing interest it pays out, such as to savings accounts or fixed deposits.  DBS\u2019 NIM rose 66 basis points to 2.12 per cent in the first quarter of 2023, from 1.46 per cent in the same period a year ago. This propelled the net profit of the largest lender in Singapore and South-east Asia\u00a0to $2.57 billion in the first quarter, up 43 per cent from a year ago and topping the $2.01 billion forecast by analysts in a Refinitiv poll.  Likewise, local rival UOB last week posted a 67 per cent surge in first-quarter net profit to a record $1.5 billion. OCBC will report its results on May 10.  Mr Gupta said NIM likely peaked in the first quarter, with the US Federal Reserve coming to the end of its rate-hiking cycle, but the decline in NIM is likely to be gradual, with the full-year margin forecast at 2.05 per cent to 2.1 per cent.  The bank\u2019s cost of funding will go up as the higher rates continue to pass through to deposits in the rest of the year, he added.  Mr Gupta expects loan growth to come in at 3 per cent to 5 per cent in 2023, comparable with his previous forecast for mid-single-digit growth.  But he said that with the April 27 hike in residential property stamp duties, DBS might not be able to close in on its target of growing housing loans by around $2 billion in 2023.  \u201cWe have to wait and see what the impact of the new measures is,\u201d said Mr Gupta, adding that it helps that 88 per cent of the bank\u2019s mortgage customers are first-time buyers who are not impacted by the policy changes.  There has also been a slowdown in margin loans, as investors would rather put their own money to work instead of borrowing from the bank amid high interest rates, he said.  DBS said asset quality remained resilient, with its non-performing loan ratio improving to 1.1 per cent, from 1.3 per cent a year ago.  Nonetheless, it set aside $99 million in general allowances, compared with a year ago when it wrote back or restored to profit $112 million.  Mr Gupta said the bank was being \u201cabundantly prudent and cautious in case there is some stress that comes out of the (high interest rate environment) in the later part of the year\u201d.  DBS\u2019 corporate loan growth in the first quarter was led by Singapore real estate acquisition financing. There was also a recovery in fee income and strong net new money inflows.  Its commercial book\u2019s first-quarter net interest income rose 69 per cent year on year to $3.38 billion, boosted by higher interest rates.  Meanwhile, net fee income from the commercial book fell 4 per cent from a year ago to $851 million.  Wealth management fees, the largest component of fee income, plunged 11 per cent due to a high base in January 2022. This was before the Ukraine war and interest rate hikes to dampen high inflation took a toll on wealth management activity, noted chief financial officer Chng Sok Hui.  But Mr Gupta noted that fee income rose in February and March, compared with the same months in 2022, reversing year-long declines.  Card fees grew 21 per cent year on year in the first quarter from higher spending, including for travel, while investment banking fees rose 2 per cent.  Deposits rose 4 per cent, or $20 billion, as the bank benefited from a flight to safety amid bank failures in the United States and Europe.  Net new money inflows doubled to $3.6 billion in March, compared with a monthly average of $2 billion in 2022, said Mrs Chng. These inflows came up to a total of $6.2 billion in the first quarter.  Mr Gupta added that some of these inflows came from the troubled US banks and Credit Suisse, \u201cbut it\u2019s hard to unravel how much comes from where\u201d.  Asked about the impact of Credit Suisse\u2019s collapse, Mr Gupta said DBS clients held around $140 million of the Swiss bank\u2019s Additional Tier 1 bonds, whose value was erased in its takeover by UBS, a small fraction of the bank\u2019s $309 billion in total assets under management.  The bank\u2019s board declared a dividend of 42 cents a share for the first quarter, up from 36 cents a year ago.  Singapore bank stocks rose on Tuesday. DBS closed 0.4 per cent higher at $32.95, while OCBC climbed 0.6 per cent to $12.66 and UOB gained 0.1 per cent to $28.26. ",

    "context": "SINGAPORE \u2013 Like many countries, Singapore has an ageing population, with many people concerned about having enough retirement savings. Financial advisers recommend an early start to retirement planning to take advantage of the longer runway for savings to grow over time. Many people will typically start retirement planning with their Central Provident Fund (CPF) savings. From Monday, to encourage those aged below 55 to plan for retirement early, DBS Bank has incorporated a new feature \u2013 \u201cYour CPF\u201d \u2013 in its digibank app to give users a clearer picture of their CPF savings. Ms Lorna Tan, head of financial planning literacy at DBS, said the new tool will enable CPF members to benchmark their retirement savings against the projected CPF retirement sums for their age cohort. This will allow them to take steps to close the gaps in their retirement savings, she added. For instance, a 29-year-old individual who earns about $6,000 every month has $75,000 in his CPF balances \u2013 $45,000 in his Ordinary Account and $15,000 each in his Special and MediSave accounts. From inputs based on his personal circumstances, which include withdrawing his savings from the Ordinary Account to buy a Housing Board flat, the \u201cYour CPF\u201d tool projects that at age 55, he will have $100,000 in his CPF balances \u2013 short of his cohort\u2019s basic retirement sum of about $114,100. The tool then recommends him to top up his Special Account by $58 every month so that he can reach his basic retirement sum by the time he is 55.\u00a0 Being able to track the progress towards the required CPF retirement sums has taken on greater importance as people are living longer after they retire. Department of Statistics data shows that total life expectancy at 65 years old rose to 21.2 years in 2021, up from 20 years in 2011. This means a 65-year-old with this life expectancy can expect to live for another 21.2 years. As people live longer, they may worry about not having enough savings to last through their golden years. Inflation is exacerbating the problem by eroding the value of money and raising the cost of living. Besides CPF, many people have other assets and liabilities, as well as insurance policies. Assets may include investments and property, while liabilities may include home and car loans, and credit card debt. The \u201cYour CPF\u201d tool recognises this, said Ms Evy Wee, DBS\u2019 head of financial planning and personal investing. \u201cWe are hoping to harness everything else, the banking data, SGFinDex, your insurance and complement what CPF has, to show whether you are on track,\u201d she said. SGFinDex, which is short for Singapore Financial Data Exchange, allows any individual to retrieve his personal financial information using his Singpass. Each individual can then consolidate his financial information from the seven participating banks (DBS, OCBC, UOB, Citi, Standard Chartered, HSBC and Maybank); insurance policy details from insurers; and investment information from the Central Depository; and his home loan from HDB and his CPF balances to get a holistic view of his financial situation.\u00a0\u00a0 An individual who realises he is not on track to meet his retirement goals may decide on \u201cthe choices and trade-offs he can make \u201d, Ms Wee said.  He could get a smaller home instead of the bigger unit he was eyeing, or give up his car and cut down on fancy meals and other expenses.  He could also look at ways to boost his income by picking up new skills or investing some of his money while being aware of the risks involved in investing.  Individuals who are on track could consider whether they want to grow their retirement savings further or deploy their savings to build a legacy for their children, Ms Wee said.\u00a0 \u201cEveryone is different. That is why our tool is designed to be personalised,\u201d she added. Ms Wee gave another example of how \u201cYour CPF\u201d can work seamlessly with other data aggregated via SGFinDex on the DBS digibank NAV Planner platform. If something happens to an individual and he cannot work for some time, will his insurance cover him during this period? Does he have other assets to fall back on if he has to stop working? Should he then get more insurance protection?\u00a0 The tool helps address these questions so the individual will not get a nasty surprise when an unfortunate situation happens, she said. Ms Wee added \u201cYour CPF\u201d and the NAV Planner are available to non-DBS/POSB customers as well. \u201cDBS/POSB customers can log into their digibank apps to access them, whereas new-to-bank customers can sign up for a digibank account with MyInfo, which is linked to their Singpass accounts,\u201d she added.",

    "context": "SINGAPORE \u2013 Emerging-market bulls betting that China\u2019s reopening would drive a year of asset outperformances are seeing their dreams turn into dust. The benchmark gauge for developing-nation stocks has not only totted up losses of more than 7 per cent since a peak in January, but is also underperforming its rich-nation counterpart by the most in three years.  Chinese shares have contributed 70 per cent of those losses, helping to erase US$750 billion (S$1 trillion) in market value. And the sell-off is spreading to nations with the closest trade ties to China, such as South Korea and South Africa. The losses have come despite the second-biggest economy expanding at a faster-than-forecast clip, led by surging exports and consumer demand. That underscores a plethora of idiosyncratic risks, not the least of which are China\u2019s increasingly assertive stance on Taiwan, its ties with Russia and the regulation of the private sector. Investors remain underexposed to China as they seek more consistent policy signals that can sustain the economic recovery.\u00a0 \u201cEven though data is still supportive of China recovery, we of course are still a bit more sceptical and look through to see if that recovery is that real,\u201d said Mr Wilfred Wee, a money manager at Ninety One Singapore. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about a sweetener or a reserve requirement ratio cut, it\u2019s about coaxing and engaging companies to excite the private sector.\u201d The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is heading for a 1.5 per cent decline in April, trimming its 2023 advance to 2 per cent. The MSCI World Index of developed-market equities is sitting on gains of four times as much. That has sent the ratio between emerging markets and rich nations down 5.6 per cent this year, the biggest retreat since at least 2020. China\u2019s economic fortunes weigh on almost two-thirds of the benchmark index\u2019s performance as, in addition to its own 30 per cent direct weighting, it impacts the outlook of eight of the 10 other nations with the biggest presence on the gauge.  It is this influence that drove a 25 per cent rally in the MSCI measure between October 2022 and January 2023 when China rolled back its crippling zero-Covid policy and set the stage for an economic reopening. Since then, China\u2019s economic data has indeed shown improvement. First-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 4.5 per cent from a year before, beating estimates of 4 per cent, while retail sales in March witnessed the fastest acceleration since June 2021. But peering beneath the hood, investors question whether these strong growth figures will continue into the second half.  Data over the weekend suggested the recovery remains lopsided, with the production side of the economy lagging the rebound in consumption. For one thing, the government is opening up new battle lines in its geopolitical quest. Escalating tensions with the United States on issues from Taiwan to TikTok and semiconductor chips threaten to make China a no-go for Western capitalists.\u00a0 US President Joe Biden is in the midst of corralling support from other nations in the US\u2019 efforts to curb investment into China\u2019s high-tech industries, and plans to take action around the time of the Group of Seven summit in May.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the private sector is getting confusing messages from Beijing. The end of a ban on Australian coal imports and easing up on tech giants helped to brighten sentiment, but other signals \u2013 such as the disappearance of the high-profile banker from China Renaissance and pressure from the nation\u2019s Finance Ministry to shun the four largest global accounting firms \u2013 are unnerving business leaders.  \u201cThe hurdle is very high,\u201d says Mr Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee. \u201cChina has numerous perceived risks, which puts it on a low priority for non-benchmarked investors. So unless the investment case is very clear or risk-reward is extremely attractive, it may be difficult to convince investors to put more cash to work in China.\u201d\u00a0 Asset allocators are voting with their feet. Overseas funds sold a net US$660 million worth of onshore China stocks in April, the first net foreign monthly outflow this year. The MSCI China Index tumbled 5.3 per cent in April, erasing this year\u2019s advance. The gauge is poised to end April with a 19 per cent valuation discount relative to the rest of emerging markets, a far cry from the 15 per cent premium it traded at a year ago. Currencies are similarly feeling the spillovers from China\u2019s uncertain growth outlook. Asian currencies have underperformed against the dollar so far this year, as the region\u2019s export-driven economies are dependent on China\u2019s outlook, while Latin America\u2019s currencies gained against the greenback mainly due to the higher carry on offer. History shows \u201cit takes two quarters to convince investors that the recovery is real,\u201d Mr Larry Hu, the head of China economics at Macquarie Group, wrote in April. \u201cDespite the stronger-than-expected first-quarter GDP number, the debate on recovery will continue in the second quarter.\u201d BLOOMBERG",

    "context": "SINGAPORE \u2013 Prices of Housing Board flats are showing signs of cooling, with resale prices rising at 1 per cent in the first three months of 2023, marking the smallest quarterly increase in the past 10 quarters, or 2\u00bd years.  The increase in the first quarter was less than half of the 2.3 per cent for September to December 2022, data from HDB showed.  Resale volume rose by 5.8 per cent to 6,979 transactions in the first quarter, from 6,597 transactions in the previous three months. Compared with the same period a year ago, resale transactions were 0.6 per cent higher. Analysts said higher housing inventory and the cooling measure introduced in September 2022 would have contributed to the slowdown in price growth.   \u201cThe housing shortage is easing as inventory builds up, with more flats being completed in recent months,\u201d said Ms Christine Sun, OrangeTee & Tie\u2019s senior vice-president of research and analytics. \u201cThe Government continues to launch BTO (Build-To-Order) projects and released new flats for sale.\u201d   Ms Sun also noted that more four-room and smaller-sized flats, totalling 5,000 units, were sold between January and March 2023, compared with 4,622 units in the last three months of 2022. The sale of five-room flats went up by 1.3 per cent, from 1,545 to 1,565 units.  Executive flats, conversely, saw volumes fall by 3.7 per cent from 430 to 414 units. Since Sept 30, 2022, private home owners must wait 15 months after the sale of their home before they can buy a resale flat without housing grants.   The temporary cooling measure, aimed at moderating demand from private home owners who tend to have a bigger budget for HDB flats, was introduced after the market showed growing signs of overheating.  Property portal Mogul.sg chief research officer Nicholas Mak believes that the 15-month wait would have contributed to the slowdown in the HDB price growth that started in the last quarter of 2020. Based on the HDB data, PropertyGuru Singapore\u00a0country\u00a0manager\u00a0Tan\u00a0Tee\u00a0Khoon noted that estates such as Woodlands, Punggol and Yishun, which saw the most BTO flats fulfilling their five-year minimum occupation period in 2023, were driving the resale market.  In terms of resale prices, Bishan reported the highest median price of $900,000 for five-room flats, while the highest median price for four-room flats was in Queenstown at $864,000. For three-room flats, Punggol and the central area recorded the highest median price at $450,000.   \u201cBuyers are still willing to pay for space and seek out larger flat types, as evidenced by the sustained demand for million-dollar flats despite the dwindling supply of five-room or larger flats,\u201d said Dr Tan. He noted that there were 94 units of million-dollar resale flats sold in the first quarter, down from 96 units in the previous quarter.    Meanwhile, the number of approved applications for HDB rentals rose 13.9 per cent to 9,657 cases, from 8,476 cases in the previous quarter. The latest number was 5.2 per cent lower than that of the same period in 2022. As at the end of March 2023, there were 56,652 HDB flats rented out.    Ms Sun said: \u201cRental demand increased as tenants returned to the market after the year-end holidays, and leasing activities increased after the Chinese New Year period.

    "context": "SINGAPORE \u2013 For a short stretch early this year, Bondee seemed on track to be the next hot app in some of the biggest markets in Asia. Millions of young people were drawn to the idea of creating cute avatars and hanging out in one another\u2019s \u201cvirtual plazas\u201d.  Users described it as a mixture of video game Animal Crossing and Meta Platforms\u2019 WhatsApp messaging service. It topped download charts in places from Singapore to South Korea.  Then things began to unravel. The trouble started with unsubstantiated rumours of credit card data leaks, which Bondee\u2019s developer, Metadream Tech, denied.  Some users pointed out Bondee\u2019s uncanny resemblance to the defunct Chinese app Zheli, better known as Jelly. That app, which briefly went viral in China in early 2022, vanished from Chinese app stores amid reports of glitchy service and questions surrounding privacy.  When Internet users in South Korea dug up government records showing that Metadream had registered in South Korea as Chinese, Bondee\u2019s developers tried to refute charges that their big hit was just a way to relaunch Jelly while obscuring its origins.  Metadream, which said it was based in Singapore, explained that it had acquired the rights to Jelly from its previous owner, True.ly of China.  While Metadream was indeed incorporated in Singapore, most of the start-up\u2019s employees were in China, and it shared legal and finance staff with Jelly\u2019s Chinese owner as at February, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Metadream was led by Mr Yang Yuxiang, an influential financier in China who spent two decades working for state-backed investment firms. He was listed as a director in Metadream\u2019s regulatory filings in Singapore, but that has recently been removed.  In any case, the damage was done. Many users did not just abandon Bondee, but also began sharing social media posts on how to delete accounts and uninstall the app.  By March, downloads from the iOS App Store and Google Play Store plunged to 400,000, from 2.6 million in February, according to data compiled by data.ai.  In part, Bondee\u2019s story illustrates the faddish nature of smartphone apps. Some users  said they simply got bored with it. One of its key features was to organise itself around social groups with a maximum of 50 members, which distinguished it from the largest social media platforms.  \u201cThat was both its value proposition and its Achilles heel,\u201d said Dr Lim Sun Sun, a professor of communications and technology at Singapore Management University. \u201cThere were simply too few people to generate traction.\u201d  But Bondee\u2019s unusually swift rise and fall also underscore a key difficulty facing Chinese companies with ambitions to reach beyond the country. The prime example of this is ByteDance\u2019s TikTok, which India banned in 2020 and which is now at the centre of a political firestorm in the United States.  The US controversy over TikTok\u2019s national security implications seems largely disconnected from the grassroots enthusiasm for the app itself. In major Asian markets such as Japan and South Korea, though, many users express a deep-seated scepticism for services originating in China, in part because of their countries\u2019 long, complicated histories with Beijing.  \u201cBondee\u2019s nationality controversy and security fears blew up, especially with TikTok fresh in people\u2019s minds,\u201d said information security professor Kim Myuhng-joo at Seoul Women\u2019s University. \u201cThere is a lesson for other companies.\u201d  Users in South Korea criticised Bondee for collecting too much personal information, such as international mobile equipment identity numbers unique to each mobile device and used by cellular networks to track them.  Some expressed concern that the Chinese government could compel Metadream to share sensitive data about its users. The company issued one statement after another to address the allegations. It reiterated on its website that it is based in Singapore and that it has set up three independent data centres in the city state, as well as in Japan and the US, to ensure data security and compliance with regional information security laws.  Metadream said in a statement posted on Feb 15 that it is registered as a Chinese company in South Korea because the process was handled by its Hong Kong unit after acquiring China\u2019s True.ly.  It acknowledged that Bondee was based on Jelly but noted it had \u201cdeveloped the creative concept further and internationalised the app, launching Bondee as a next-generation social app\u201d.  Metadream declined an interview request and did not respond to e-mailed questions.  After witnessing the intense scrutiny TikTok has faced in the US and elsewhere, many Chinese start-ups have been trying to distance themselves from their origins and emphasising their global nature, or even hoping to pass off as local companies in the markets they target.  Singapore, which has long played a neutral role in international affairs, is a natural location for Chinese firms seeking a new base. Firms that have moved their headquarters to the Republic include Shein, a popular fashion retailer, and TikTok, which has its main offices there and in Los Angeles. But there is a danger that people may think you have something to hide if you make such moves.  The scrutiny highlights how sensitive young smartphone users in countries such as South Korea are to potential privacy and data security risks, said Professor Kim Sangkyun at Kyung Hee University\u2019s graduate school of business administration in Seoul.  \u201cThey felt they were misled by Bondee,\u201d he noted. \u201cYou can create the most aesthetically pleasing metaverse platform, but if people feel misled or unsafe, they are not going to stick around and socialise. Trust is everything.\u201d BLOOMBERG ",

    "context": "SINGAPORE - The latest round of cooling measures was aimed at preventing property prices from being pushed up by investors and prioritising Singaporeans buying homes for owner-occupation, said National Development Minister Desmond Lee on Thursday. The Government imposed the latest round of increases in additional buyer\u2019s stamp duty (ABSD) rates to pre-empt such investment demand, he told reporters. Mr Lee also flagged the latest warning by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) that Singapore\u2019s growth prospects could be affected amid higher interest rates and the reconfiguration of supply chains in the face of US-China trade tensions.  The authorities announced late on Wednesday that the ABSD rate for foreigners buying any residential property in Singapore will be raised from 30 per cent to 60 per cent. For Singapore citizens, the rate will be raised from 17 per cent to 20 per cent for those buying their second residential property, and from 25 per cent to 30 per cent for those getting their third and subsequent property. Singapore permanent residents (PRs) buying their second residential property will see the rate rise from 25 per cent to 30 per cent, and from 30 per cent to 35 per cent for third and subsequent properties. Private home prices have jumped 3.3 per cent in the first quarter of 2023, after rising 0.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2022. Foreign interest in Singapore residential property, as an asset class, is rising again, even though earlier cooling measures and border closures over the past two years had helped moderate it. \u201cOver successive rounds of property-related measures, you\u2019ve seen foreign investment, as a proportion of private property transactions, fall from 20 per cent in 2011 to about 3 per cent to 4 per cent over the last few years. The average from 2017 to 2019 was around 6 per cent,\u201d said Mr Lee.  But foreigners are again getting interested in the Singapore property market and accounted for 7 per cent of all transactions in the first quarter of 2023, said Mr Lee. \u201cTherefore, if we don\u2019t take early pre-emptive measures, we may see investment numbers, both by locals and by foreigners, grow, and that will add stress to Singaporeans who are looking to buy for owner-occupation,\u201d he said. Asked why the rate hike for foreigners was much larger than that for locals, Mr Lee said the Government had to \u201ccalibrate the ABSD rate in order to have an effective dampener on investments from abroad\u201d. He added that as Singaporeans and PRs are \u201cvery sensitive to changes in ABSD\u201d, the increase of 3 percentage points to 5 percentage points in rates should be sufficient to dampen investment interest.  Based on 2022 data, the ABSD rate hikes will affect about 10 per cent of all private residential property transactions \u2013 involving foreign investors as well as those buying their second and subsequent property.  \u201cYou may say it\u2019s just 10 per cent, but actually you want to make sure that this does not grow significantly,\u201d said Mr Lee. \u201cWe are taking calibrated steps for a property market that remains resilient at a time of significant economic uncertainty and a high interest rate environment. It is quite different from after the global financial crisis situation where you had a V-shaped economic recovery and a very bullish property market and when interest rates were at historic lows.\u201d  He said the pandemic had also had an impact on construction and supply. Rising demand and tight supply could have acted as a \u201cdouble-whammy\u201d, he added. This is the fourth time that ABSD rates have been raised since the measure was first introduced in December 2011. Rates were hiked in December 2021, July 2018 and January 2013. The last two rounds of property cooling measures in December 2021 and September 2022, coupled with uncertain economic conditions and higher mortgage rates, had helped moderate private residential prices in the fourth quarter of 2022 before these rebounded in the first quarter of 2023. Mr Lee attributed the strong local demand to pandemic-related construction delays, and more buyers wanting larger apartments.  \u201cThis is on top of the socioeconomic development of Singapore, as you see more people, more nuclear families, more individuals moving out or seniors living on their own,\u201d he added. Asked whether the latest ABSD rate will affect the Housing Board resale market, Mr Lee said this market \u201chas seen some moderation\u201d. \u201cBut it is not just about demand-side measures like ABSD, it is also about supply in both the private residential market, as well as the HDB market. There has been a significant increase in supply,\u201d he said. On rentals, Mr Lee noted that prior to the pandemic, rental demand growth from locals has been low.  \u201cDuring the pandemic, you see foreigners falling out of the picture, but the increase in rental demand from Singapore residents has been very significant, in the four-digit figures. \u201cWith supply coming on market, and more Singaporeans exiting (renting), we expect pressures on the rental market to moderate later this year, into next year.\u201d But he said the authorities would keep a close eye on the rental market as it does impact Singaporeans and those working in Singapore companies. Asked if ABSD rates could drop, Mr Lee said: \u201cOver the last one, two years, you\u2019ve seen both HDB and private property go up\u2026 and we\u2019ve had to take a series of measures both on the supply side (and) on the demand side to make sure that we achieve stability, and that the markets don\u2019t run ahead of economic fundamentals.  \u201cAs to whether any of these measures can be unwound or relaxed or maybe even tightened, that is something that we keep a very close eye on,\u201d he added.",

    "context": "SINGAPORE \u2013 The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras) is offering a reward of up to $100,000 to whistle-blowers who call out private property buyers who use the so-called \u201c99-to-1\u201d or similar arrangements to evade or reduce the additional buyer\u2019s stamp duty (ABSD) on their purchase.  A reward based on 15 per cent of the tax recovered \u2013 capped at $100,000 \u2013 for each case will be given to informants if the information and/or documents provided lead to tax recovery, the tax regulator said on Tuesday.  This is not the first time Iras has offered a reward for information on tax avoidance or evasion.  About 0.5 per cent of private residential properties transacted in the period from 2018 to 2021 involved 99-to-1, or similar, purchase arrangements, where the owners sold a partial interest in the home to another buyer within a short period, Senior Minister of State for Finance Chee Hong Tat told Parliament last Friday in response to questions by MPs on such arrangements.  The loophole enables those who already own property to reduce or avoid paying ABSD while still becoming the additional property\u2019s co-owner and a co-applicant for a loan to finance the purchase.  Earlier in April, ST reported that Iras sent letters to some first-time buyers asking them to explain why they sold just 1 per cent of the property to a relative within a short period after exercising the purchase option.  Mr Chee said such arrangements made up a \u201cvery small\u201d but rising proportion of overall residential transactions in recent years.  In response to ST\u2019s queries, Iras on Tuesday said it is unable to disclose details of these transactions as the audit is ongoing.  The taxman added that it is unable to disclose \u201cthe number of 99-to-1 transactions that it has identified, including similar arrangements, as well as the number of buyers who have been penalised, or the number of promoters/facilitators who have been referred to the relevant regulatory agencies\u201d.  Iras said its audit will be done in phases and that it will also probe transactions that took place after 2021.  When asked, it did not specify if decoupling arrangements will be looked into. Under this practice, a co-owner of a property would transfer his share to another person, enabling him to buy a second property without having to pay ABSD as that transaction would be deemed his first.  A total of 95,755 private homes (excluding executive condominiums) were transacted between 2018 and 2021, said Ms Christine Sun, senior vice-president of research and analytics at OrangeTee & Tie.  So 0.5 per cent of that total would amount to 479 units sold under 99-to-1 deals, she added.  Property curbs such as ABSD were introduced in December 2011, with a 3 per cent duty tacked on Singaporeans\u2019 third and subsequent property purchases. Permanent residents buying a second or subsequent residential unit had to pay ABSD of 3 per cent, while foreigners paid 10 per cent ABSD for every property.  These rates have been raised a few times since 2011. From Thursday, Singaporeans will have to pay 20 per cent ABSD on their second property, and 30 per cent on their third, and foreigners will have to pay 60 per cent ABSD for any property. Those who are aware of tax avoidance or tax evasion arrangements can write to Iras at\u00a0estamp@iras.gov.sg  Reward payments are at the discretion of Iras, which said it will keep confidential the identities of informants and documents/information. Iras added: \u201cWe understand that individuals may enter into various property purchase arrangements for different reasons, both tax- and non-tax related. Whether a case involves tax avoidance depends on the facts and circumstances surrounding the case.\u201d Taxpayers who wish to come forward voluntarily to disclose and make good any underpayment of taxes may do so, and Iras will, in general, look at such cases more favourably. In cases of tax avoidance, the Commissioner of Stamp Duties will disregard or vary any tax avoidance arrangement, recover the rightful amount of stamp duty and impose a 50 per cent surcharge on the additional duty payable.  Further penalties of up to four times the outstanding amount may be imposed if the stamp duty and surcharge are not paid by the deadline, the taxman said. ",

    "context": "SINGAPORE \u2013 Wages of Singaporeans and permanent residents (PRs) are likely to go up at a slower pace in 2023 as workers continue to enter the country and overall demand for labour softens as the economy slows.  But while wage growth is expected to ease further, it will stay above its historical average, said the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) on Wednesday. The risk is low that wages and prices will keep pushing each other higher, added the central bank, citing its studies which indicate that wages respond less than proportionately to prices in the near term. \u201cNevertheless, policy and administrative factors will put a floor on the extent to which resident wage growth in certain industries eases in the near term,\u201d said MAS in its biannual macroeconomic review.  These include policies to uplift incomes of lower-wage workers, including enhancements to the Progressive Wage Model, and salary increases in the civil service, healthcare and education sectors, which will support overall resident wage growth. The rise in wages will also likely be uneven across sectors. It will be higher for travel-related and domestic-oriented ones like construction, real estate, retail as well as food and beverage \u2013 compared with the external-oriented types like trade and manufacturing. The growth in real wages \u2013 factoring in the impact of inflation \u2013 will also be greater for lower-income households compared with higher-income ones amid policies aimed at raising lower-income workers\u2019 wages, said MAS.  It also pointed to early indicators of the tight labour market easing, in line with a slowdown in the Singapore economy.  The number of employees temporarily laid off or placed on short work weeks rose while retrenchments picked up in the fourth quarter, reaching a similar level to the pre-pandemic average.  Market indicators also suggest reduced job-hopping among workers moving to higher-wage positions.  Resident wage growth slowed to 5.4 per cent year on year in the fourth quarter, down from 7.1 per cent in the third quarter. Compared to the previous quarter and seasonally adjusted, wage growth eased to 1 per cent in the fourth quarter, cooling from 1.2 per cent in the third quarter.   \u201cOn the whole, the trajectory of resident wage growth has been broadly comparable to that of past cyclical recoveries, with wage growth gradually coming off as the recovery matures,\u201d said MAS.  These numbers come even as total employment in 2022 as a whole expanded by 250,100, bringing the workforce to 2.9 per cent above its pre-Covid-19 level.  The resident unemployment rate declined from 2.9 per cent in September to 2.8 per cent in December, and slipped further to 2.7 per cent in the first two months of this year.  Meanwhile, the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed persons rose from 2.02 in September to 2.33 in December, reflecting a larger drop in the number of jobless workers compared with job openings.  MAS noted that while the resident unemployment rate has been low in recent quarters, it may not fully reflect employers\u2019 difficulty in finding staff.  \u201cThe persistent skills mismatch between labour demand and the resident workforce might have arisen after the onset of Covid-19 as businesses accelerated their transition towards digital solutions such as e-commerce and work from home applications. \u201cThe increased demand for such applications has endured, raising the need for more software developers and employees conversant with digital technologies,\u201d it said.  Software developers and managers were among the professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMET) in demand, going by the number of job vacancies, in 2021 to 2022. Openings also rose significantly for e-commerce-related roles such as delivery drivers.  The central bank cited surveys done in December and early this year which indicated that the pace of hiring should ease in the first half of 2023.  The employment outlook is likely to have deteriorated since then as turmoil in the international banking sector broke out after the surveys were conducted, it added.  \u201cEmployment growth in the modern services cluster, which includes information and communications and financial services, is likely to slow further in the quarters ahead amid recent stresses in the global banking system and further increases in global interest rates.  \u201cHowever, the extent of net employment losses in modern services should be contained, given the strong structural demand for finance and tech professionals in Singapore,\u201d it added.  There are bright spots from domestic-oriented and travel-related clusters, with a planned ramp-up in flights from China to Singapore helping tourist arrivals and spending to recover further.  This will boost hiring in travel-related and consumer services sectors, as well as ancillary administrative and support services, said MAS, adding that public-sector projects will also likely support the construction sector\u2019s demand for workers.  There will also be some labour hoarding, with firms eager to hold on to workers after experiencing severe shortages in the past two years. Job creation in the more labour-intensive domestic-oriented and travel-related clusters is expected to offset the hiring slowdown and pockets of retrenchments in the trade-related and modern services clusters.  \u201cThus, the aggregate resident workforce should continue expanding, albeit at a slightly more modest pace compared with last year,\u201d said MAS.

    "context": "SINGAPORE - Residential rent increases should ease in the coming quarters as more homes are completed and rental demand moderates, said a report by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) on Wednesday. Demand is likely to abate as a significant number of residential units are completed and Singaporeans and permanent residents (PRs) vacate their rental units to move into their new homes.  The study of Singapore\u2019s rental market was conducted by the Ministry of National Development and carried in MAS\u2019 biannual macroeconomic review. It noted that real estate agencies have anecdotally reported a decline in viewings for rental units and leasing inquiries since the start of 2023. \u201cGlobal economic uncertainties and slower growth may also further weigh on sentiments in the rental market,\u201d it added. Since 2021, rents for Housing Board flats have surged 38 per cent, while those for private homes have shot up 43 per cent, after staying broadly stable in the preceding few years. The sharp rise in rent was broad-based, with similar increases across market segments and housing types.  For instance, in 2022, rents of landed private homes rose by 28.1 per cent, while those of condominium units increased by 29.8 per cent.  Meanwhile, rents of five-room HDB flats climbed 29.5 per cent, while three-room flat rents rose by 24.6 per cent. The report noted that the upward momentum in the residential rental market since 2021 was primarily due to an \u201cexceptional demand-supply imbalance\u201d caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.  \u201cSuch market imbalances have already started to ease and will continue to do so progressively through this year, along with the significant housing supply coming on-stream and an expected moderation in rental demand,\u201d it said.  \u201cAccordingly, further residential rent increases should ease in the coming quarters.\u201d In 2021 and 2022, the housing market was facing extremely tight supply conditions as the construction industry was significantly impacted. This was coupled with global supply chain disruptions and shortages in foreign manpower and construction materials due to tightened border controls.  The two-month circuit breaker in 2020 and the stringent safe management measures after also affected the subsequent pace at which construction activity could resume. As a result, there were severe delays to the completion of private and public residential projects islandwide, said the report. Between 2020 and 2022, about 20,000 private and public homes were completed yearly.  This was about 22 per cent lower than the average of around 26,000 units per year from 2018 to 2019, and about 36 per cent lower than the projected average of 32,000 units per year between 2023 and 2025, said the report.     The supply crunch also coincided with strong rental demand in 2021 and 2022, it noted.     While non-resident rental demand fell during the pandemic, more Singaporeans and PRs sought temporary accommodation while waiting for their homes to be completed. Singaporeans and PRs accounted for an increase in demand of around 7,000 private rental units in 2021.  This compared with an average annual increase in demand from Singaporeans and PRs of 1,300 private rental units in 2018 and 2019. That sharp increase in demand outweighed the fall in non-resident rental demand of around 4,200 private units in 2021. When border restrictions were eased in 2022, the trend was reversed and non-resident private rental demand rebounded to an increase of around 2,300 units, similar to 2019. A similar trend was observed in the HDB rental market. Other factors that may have contributed to the strong pace of market rent increases include robust employment and wage conditions.  Looking ahead, MAS said supply-side pressures are easing as the construction industry recovers ground.     Almost 40,000 public and private homes will be completed in 2023, the highest number of annual completions since 2018. These include around 8,000 private homes, including executive condominiums, completed in the last two quarters, double the average of about 2,000 units completed per quarter in 2021 and 2022.    On the public housing front, HDB is on track to complete 20,000 Build-To-Order (BTO) flats in 2023, which is close to triple the 7,000 BTO flats completed in 2020. The pace of completion will continue over the next two years, with close to 100,000 private and public homes to be completed from 2023 to 2025. At the same time, the supply of both public and private homes has been ramped up to cater to the housing needs of the population over the next few years, the report said.",

    "context": "SINGAPORE \u2013 Most people here surveyed recently no longer view Covid-19 as a threat, with about 35 per cent saying they have no intention of getting more vaccine booster shots.\u200b Among those who do not plan to get further booster jabs are people aged 60 and above, even though they are at greater risk of severe infection, according to a recent YouGov survey commissioned by Moderna Biotech Singapore and the Asia Pacific Immunisation Coalition (Apic). A total of 1,110 people, aged 18 to older than 60, participated in the survey, which was conducted online and in English between March 30 and April 12. The participants included people with diabetes, heart conditions or chronic lung conditions. At an event at the ArtScience Museum to unveil the survey results on Tuesday, Professor Tikki Pangestu, the co-chair of Apic, said it is a worry that only 15 per cent of those aged 60 and above see Covid-19 as a high or very high risk threat to their health; and nearly 38 per cent do not plan on getting more booster vaccinations. The survey results come as Singapore is experiencing a small surge in Covid-19 cases, resulting in some hospitalisations, which adds to the hospitals\u2019 high number of non-Covid-19 patients. The majority of hospitalised Covid-19 patients are those aged 60 and above. Adjunct Associate Professor Matthias Toh from the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), who attended the event, said NCID saw more of these patients in the last one to two weeks, and some of them had not been vaccinated at all. Prof Pangestu said many people are not keen to take booster shots because of several factors, including vaccination fatigue and continued fear of side effects. Recent news of the State Coroner\u2019s ruling that the death of a 43-year-old domestic worker \u2013 certified as caused by myocarditis \u2013 was related to her Covid-19 vaccination would strike fear in people, he said, but added: \u201cWhat people forget is that that was a very, very rare event.\u201d  The worker had died days after taking a booster dose in 2021. More than half of the survey respondents stated that they feared the potential side effects of Covid-19 vaccines more than contracting Covid-19 itself.  In the survey, only 8.8 per cent of those aged 60 and above said they would take a booster dose every six months.  About 20 per cent of this group said they would take a booster dose as frequently as advised by the Ministry of Health (MOH), 23.7 per cent said they would take it every year and around 8 per cent said they would take it every two years.  Dr Ong Kian Chung, president of the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Association (Singapore), who was on a panel discussion at the event, said he has been asking his patients to get the booster jabs, but not all will take the advice. Recently, one of his patients with lung issues told him she would not get a booster jab because \u201cthe pandemic is over\u201d, he said.  Endocrinologist Ben Ng, another private sector specialist on the panel, said another factor in the decision over booster shots is the patients\u2019 perception of their disease and whether they are vulnerable. \u201cMany patients with diabetes, they think that, \u2018Oh, because my sugar\u2019s well controlled, I am well looked after, there\u2019s no problem\u2019, and that\u2019s clearly false,\u201d he said. Doctors have seen diabetes patients who contract Covid-19 become ill. These patients had extremely high blood sugar levels and their illness was more severe, he said. Prof Pangestu said that to get people to take the booster jabs, the approach has to be personalised.  \u201cHealthcare professionals... need to absolutely take the time to understand why people are hesitant, and then adapt and use the right kind of messages to show empathy and compassion,\u201d he said.  Among the positive findings from the survey is the view from the majority of respondents that vaccines are important, said Prof Pangestu. He said the Singapore Government has done very well in navigating the pandemic, and that without doubt, the speed of its reaction was excellent. Singapore has moved on to living with Covid-19, but there is no room for complacency. The medically vulnerable and at-risk groups remain susceptible to Covid-19 infection, the panel said.  \u201cWe must now come together to discuss and agree on how we act now that the virus is endemic. Vaccines have been crucial in helping us emerge from the pandemic, and they still have a large role to play, especially in protecting the vulnerable from severe infection,\u201d said Prof Pangestu.",

    "context": "SINGAPORE \u2013 Some clinics have been reporting an uptick in the number of people getting vaccinated against influenza,  continuing a trend observed during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Dr Edwin Chng, a medical director at\u00a0Parkway\u00a0Shenton, which has about 30 general practitioner (GP) clinics in Singapore,\u00a0said the group saw the number of people who got the flu jab in 2022 double from that in 2021. \u201cThere has been a 20 to 30 per cent increase in the number of people getting flu vaccinations in the past year,\u201d said Dr Lim Lee Wei, a GP with Northeast Medical Group.  Raffles Medical, which has more than 50 clinics across the island, also reported an increase of between 20 per cent and 30 per cent in the number of people having flu jabs in the same period.  At the height of the pandemic in 2020, demand for flu vaccines in Singapore spiked even though infections were low and Covid-19 restrictions were in place.  The Ministry of Health\u2019s (MOH) National Population Health Survey 2021, which was released in December, showed that 18.7 per cent of people aged between 18 and 74 said they had a flu injection in the past 12 months, when the survey was taken.  This is up from 13.1 per cent in 2017.  The survey, which is conducted annually, tracked the health and risk factors, and lifestyle practices of more than 8,000 Singapore residents between July 2020 and June 2021.  It also found that the proportion of residents aged 65 to 74 who reported getting a flu shot rose from 24.2 per cent in 2019 to 32.4 per cent in 2021.  \u201cThere has been an increase across all age groups, but particularly more in seniors aged 65 and above,\u201d said Raffles Medical family physician Michael Wong.  MOH suggested that this could be due to greater awareness about the importance of vaccination, following the Covid-19 pandemic.  Dr Lim also pointed to \u201cgenerous government subsidies\u201d for those getting a flu jab.  Under the National Adult Immunisation Schedule, eligible Singapore citizens aged 65 years and above can receive subsidised flu vaccinations at Community Health Assist Scheme GP clinics.\u00a0 Since November 2022, people can book an appointment for an influenza vaccination with more than 580 GPs through a government health appointment system. The number of flu cases in 2023 has been increasing, from 96 in January to 421 in March, according to MOH\u2019s monitoring of polyclinic cases.  Among those who got a flu jab recently is Ms Kareena Natasha. She got her jab in December 2022 as she was travelling to a country with a cold climate.  \u201cI wanted to keep myself protected and safe enough for travelling,\u201d the 20-year-old student said.  With many people unmasking after pandemic restrictions were eased in 2022, she also wanted to keep herself healthy, having caught Covid-19 earlier last year.  Ms Kareena said her mother, a nurse, regularly reminds her to get her jabs. \u201cSo I\u2019m waiting to take my next shot this coming June,\u201d she said.  Dr Chng noted that vaccination lowers the risk of influenza infection, and also reduces the severity of infection if one falls sick.  \u201cStudies also show that it is linked to a lower heart attack and stroke risk.  \u201cIn pregnant women, flu vaccination helps to protect them from falling ill and helps protect their infants from flu in their first few months of life,\u201d he said.  More public awareness is needed on the importance of the flu jab, said Dr Wong.    \u201cIncreased public awareness of influenza illness, its risks, the benefits of flu vaccination, and its safety record should continue to be aired through official media channels in the same way that the community was encouraged to undergo Covid-19 vaccination,\u201d he added.

    "context": "TAIPEI - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co\u2019s (TSMC) profit beat expectations after its chip margins held up better than anticipated, assuaging concerns about fallout from a plunge in global electronics demand.  It posted net income of NT$206.9 billion (S$9 billion) for the January to March quarter, compared with the NT$194.2 billion that analysts had projected on average. TSMC, maker of the most advanced chips for global electronics leaders from Apple to Nvidia Corp, previously reported disappointing revenue for the three-month period. Taiwan\u2019s largest company is grappling with persistently weak electronics demand, as consumers and corporations tighten their budgets to deal with soaring inflation and a potential global recession. PC shipments crashed by 29 per cent in the first quarter, led by Apple\u2019s Mac line-up, according to the latest IDC figures. TSMC had already slashed its capital spending plans for 2023 to a range of US$32 billion to US$36 billion (S$42.7 billion to S$48 billion), down from US$36.3 billion in 2022. Executives said in January that they expected revenue to decline by a mid-to-high single-digit percentage in the first half, though business should pick up thereafter as the Chinese economy and consumer spending stabilise. TSMC\u2019s market leadership likely buoyed its margins. On Wednesday, fellow industry bellwether ASML Holding \u2013 the largest producer of equipment essential to advanced chipmaking \u2013 forecast better-than-anticipated April to June quarter revenue. But net bookings, a barometer of future growth, plunged 46 per cent from a year earlier. Lam Research Corp, another equipment supplier to TSMC, also forecast adjusted earnings per share that missed the average analyst estimate. TSMC executives were expected to deliver their outlook for this quarter and 2023 during their earnings conference call later on Thursday. Some analysts fear that the company may lower its outlook or capital spending plans, which would suggest a longer-lasting industry slump.  Over the longer term, investors are hopeful that TSMC\u2019s leading technology can galvanise growth, particularly as a surge in artificial intelligence development and applications drives demand for the high-end computing chips and data centres required for training and hosting AI models.  The outlook, however, remains clouded by geopolitical uncertainty, including global efforts to encroach upon TSMC\u2019s turf in advanced chipmaking and China\u2019s growing military threats against Taiwan. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said in a recent interview that he had divested the majority of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s US$4.1 billion stake in TSMC partly due to geopolitical concerns.  TSMC is under pressure to produce its advanced chips abroad and is building more capacity in the United States and Japan. Global policymakers and customers are increasingly wary of their technological reliance on Taiwan, which Beijing has claimed is part of China. BLOOMBERG",

    "context": "Ms Sharon Rosel was woken up by her dog\u2019s barking in the wee hours of last Thursday and looked out of her balcony in British Colombia, Canada.  Standing next to her car was a black bear, surrounded by shattered glass from the car window.  For the next 1.5 hours, Ms Rosel watched from her balcony as the bear used its teeth to rip open soda cans that she had left in the car.  \u201c(It) was drinking massive amounts of soda,\u201d said Ms Rosel in a report by public broadcaster Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)\u00a0on Monday.  She said that there were 72 cans of soda in her car and the bear drank 69.  It started by drinking orange soda, followed by cola and root beer, said Ms Rosel. But the animal did not touch the diet soda cans.  Ms Rosel, who owns a food truck, said she had bought the soda for her business the previous day.\u00a0 She said that she deals with bears on a daily basis as she lives in a remote area. She is normally hyper-vigilant and careful to not leave food in her car, said the CBC report.\u00a0 However, she did not expect that the bear would be attracted to soda.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve been around bears since I was knee-high to a grasshopper, and I have never seen them go after pop,\u201d said Ms Rosel.\u00a0 The bear damaged the car by ripping its interior leather, breaking the window roller handle and spilling soda everywhere.  Ms Rosel hopes that insurance will cover some of the damage.  The non-profit society Sunshine Coast Bear Alliance said that bears are highly skilled at gaining entry to cars\u00a0and can cause significant damage.\u00a0 \u201c(Bears) can be attracted to the slightest aroma in your car, such as a candy wrapper or scented air freshener. Please keep your vehicle windows closed and locked and doors locked to avoid damage and a surprise encounter,\u201d said the non-profit society on its website.  This is not the first time that bears were found to have consumed soda.  In 2019, a family watched a bear in Gatlinburg in the United States eat food and drink soda.  Separately, a 90kg black bear was found dead in 1985 after consuming an overdose of cocaine. The incident spurred the movie, Cocaine Bear in February. ",

    "context": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Seagate Technology Holdings, the world\u2019s biggest maker of computer hard drives, will pay a US$300 million (S$400 million) civil penalty to the US Commerce Department to resolve alleged violations of export controls in selling millions of units to Huawei Technologies. The deal announced on Wednesday is the largest stand-alone settlement in the history of the Bureau of Industry and Security, which is in charge of export controls, the Commerce Department said in a statement.  The penalty represents the latest in a string of actions by Washington to keep sophisticated technology from China that may support its military, enable human rights abuses or threaten US security. The US government said Seagate wrongly interpreted the foreign product rule to require evaluation of only the last stage of its manufacturing process rather than the entire process. Seagate made drives in China, Northern Ireland, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and the United States, the order said, and used equipment, including testing equipment, subject to the rule. As part of the settlement, Seagate admitted to the accusations. It also agreed to three audits of its compliance programme, and is subject to a five-year suspended order over its export privileges. The news should be positive for the company because discussions with investors had indicated that they expected a fine of US$500 million to US$1 billion, Wells Fargo analysts said in a research report. The company first revealed the accusations against it in October. Seagate was scheduled to report earnings on Thursday. Its shares fell 2.2 per cent  to US$62.86 on Wednesday before the announcement. The penalty is roughly equivalent to a quarter of net income for the company, based on its financial performance over the last few years. Seagate is projected to have a net income of about US$400 million in 2023 as it suffers weaker demand for its products. The United States in 2019 placed Huawei on its Entity List, prohibiting American firms from doing business with the Chinese technology company without getting a government licence.  Seagate continued to do so, selling more than 7.4 million hard disk drives to Huawei without authorisation, the Commerce Department said. The company thus violated the foreign direct product rule of August 2020, which prohibits shipping to Huawei items that are the direct result of US technology or software. The US has been wielding the export control power of its Commerce Department as one of its main tools to stifle China\u2019s technological ambitions and bolster national security. Seagate continued to do business with Huawei despite the fact that its only two competitors stopped selling hard disk drives to the company, and entered into a three-year agreement with Huawei, the Commerce Department said.  Seagate repeatedly authorised lines of credit to Huawei totalling more than US$1 billion between January and September 2021, causing an increase in exports of hard disk drives to Huawei that the company was otherwise unable to obtain, the department said. Seagate said in a filing that it will pay the penalty in quarterly instalments of US$15 million over five years starting in October.  BLOOMBERG",

    "context": "HONG KONG - Eagle-eyed travellers \u2013 including some Singaporeans \u2013 snapped up US$10,000 (S$13,300) business class tickets on Japan\u2019s ANA airline for just a few hundred dollars, after the glitch circulated on some travel-related platforms. But in the latest twist to the story, most may not get to enjoy their once-in-a-lifetime deal. ANA Holdings said on Wednesday that the mistake stemmed from an error on its Vietnam website, which listed an erroneous currency conversion.  It did not state how many people had secured discount tickets and said it was investigating the cause of the bug and the size of its damage. An ANA spokesman initially said the airline would honour the tickets for those who had bought them. But the carrier said later that a final decision had not been made, adding that one would be reached before the end of the month. The discounted tickets will still be valid for the people who fly before that decision is made.\u00a0 Most of the tickets were for travel starting in Jakarta, through to Japan and then on to New York and back again into various South-east Asia destinations, including Singapore and Bali \u2013 business class all the way.   Mr Rishi Kumar, a 25-year-old Singaporean engineer and aviation enthusiast, told The Straits Times that he was alerted on Tuesday afternoon to the \u201cerror fare\u201d by the SG Travel Hacks | Suitesmile Telegram group. Error fares or airline price glitches are hugely reduced flight tickets due to a mistake. He told his friend, and they quickly booked return flights in September from Jakarta to Toronto for $460 each. The non-direct flights stop at Washington, DC, on the way out, and San Francisco and Tokyo on the return trip. Mr Edwin Ang, 22, a full-time national serviceman, and two friends in local universities booked non-direct flights in January from Jakarta to New York for $471, he told ST. Mr Ang was alerted to the once-in-a-lifetime deal by a Telegram group on how to benefit from airline miles \u2013 The MileLion. The trio then amended their bookings to have the flight originate from Singapore instead for a $56 refund. Mr Ang, who had no idea yet what he would do in New York, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a really good deal that I knew I could not pass up, given the rarity of such fare errors.\u201d Mr Johnny Wong, who works in the airline industry, snagged a round-trip ticket from Jakarta to Honolulu via Narita airport in Tokyo for 13 million Vietnamese dong (S$740). \u201cI never thought I\u2019d catch such a deal,\u201d Mr Wong told Bloomberg News.  The 29-year-old said he felt the pressure to enter his details as fast as he could, racing against time before ANA realised its error. The fare is now US$8,200. It is not the first time an airline has inadvertently sold premium seats at a steep discount. Cathay Pacific Airways accidentally sold deeply discounted first and business class tickets from Vietnam to the United States back in 2019 for as little as US$675 when the normal price would have been as much as US$16,000. It honoured those tickets. BLOOMBERG ",

    "context": "SAN FRANCISCO - Meta Platforms is set to commence company-wide layoffs on Wednesday as it restructures teams and works towards founder Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s goal of greater efficiency.    The Facebook parent company notified managers to prepare to announce job cuts on Wednesday, via a memo seen by Bloomberg News.    It indicates that Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Reality Labs \u2013 which houses the company\u2019s virtual reality efforts and Quest hardware \u2013 will all be impacted by the decision.    The move is part of a cost-cutting push that will eventually whittle away 10,000 positions at the company, as announced by Mr Zuckerberg in March. A further round of cuts is set to follow in May. Meta already cut about 13 per cent of its workforce, or about 11,000 jobs, in November.   It also extended a hiring freeze through the first quarter, which has been punctuated by job and cost cuts by other Silicon Valley businesses.  Mr Zuckerberg\u2019s comments have suggested that the company would aim to become more lean and rebalance its ratio of technologists and engineers to business and administrative staff.

The cuts will span television, film, theme parks and corporate positions, and affect every region where Disney operates, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the details are not public. Some affected workers will be notified as early as next Monday.\u00a0  The company did not respond to requests for comment.

The cuts are coming across the company, the people said, including at Disney Entertainment, which was created in a restructuring in 2023 as home to the company\u2019s film and TV production and distribution businesses, including streaming. As part of that restructuring, chief executive Bob Iger moved to restore authority to creative executives.

    "context": "SINGAPORE - Deutsche Bank aims to double private banking revenue from Asia in five years by ramping up efforts to attract the region\u2019s ultra-wealthy, joining other firms seeking to pounce on opportunities created by the near-collapse of Credit Suisse Group.  The bank is targeting entrepreneurs with investible assets of at least \u20ac50 million (S$73 million), Ms Young Jin Yee, the lender\u2019s international private bank head for Asia-Pacific, said in her first interview since joining from the Swiss rival in January.  \u201cOur ambition is to double our revenue by 2027 with only a 30 per cent increase in our relationship-manager headcount,\u201d said Ms Young, who spent about 20 years at Credit Suisse.  She said that everyone \u201chas to do more with their clients\u201d.  Marking her first 100 days at the Frankfurt-based bank, Ms Young hosted an internal town hall to launch the strategy on Tuesday in Hong Kong, while hundreds of employees across the region dialled in from Greater China, Singapore, India and Dubai.  The lender has been hiring senior wealth executives in Asia, given it is one of the fastest-growing markets. As at 2021, Deutsche Bank ranked 14th on the Asian Private Banker list for Asia excluding mainland China, based on US$79 billion (S$105.3 billion) in assets, compared with the Swiss bank\u2019s US$239 billion, according to the publication, which put UBS Group on top of that list.  Relationship managers at the time numbered 210, less than a third of the 680 at Credit Suisse. Ms Young reports to Mr Claudio de Sanctis, head of the international private bank \u2013 which includes wealth management. He joined in 2018 after five years at Credit Suisse and a longer stint at UBS.  The pairing of the duo highlights Deutsche Bank\u2019s ambitions to catch up with its Swiss and US rivals, which have long dominated the wealth industry.  Ms Young, 48, was No. 2 at the Swiss bank\u2019s Asia wealth operations.  \u201cWe want to make sure that in the next five years and beyond, we are recognised as the best private bank for Asia-Pacific, the way we define it,\u201d said Ms Young, a Singaporean, who is based in the city-state. \u201cSize doesn\u2019t matter. We want to be the bank that clients want to bank with, especially for entrepreneurs and their families.\u201d Ms Young\u2019s strategy echoes that of her previous employer. Under former chief executive Tidjane Thiam, Credit Suisse was wooing rich entrepreneurs to manage their personal fortune and help their businesses with stock listings or acquisitions. Additionally, Deutsche Bank has corporate banking operations that lend to businesses in Asia.\n Deutsche Bank will have to compete with UBS, the world\u2019s largest wealth manager that agreed to buy Credit Suisse in a government-backed rescue in March.  Among foreign banks, UBS dominates most wealth markets in the region, including Greater China and South-east Asia.  Other wealth managers with big Asian operations and headcount include Citigroup and HSBC Holdings.  In Asia, HSBC, DBS Group Holdings and China Merchants Bank are among firms gaining wealth flows from a market share loss triggered by disruption from the UBS-Credit Suisse merger, Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Sharnie Wong said in a report.  There are plenty of former Credit Suisse assets up for grabs.  The bank saw clients pull US$4.4 billion from US and European funds since the lender agreed to be acquired by UBS, according to Morningstar. The figures only include funds that report daily numbers and do not represent the full universe of Credit Suisse asset management. Even before the hastily arranged deal with UBS, Credit Suisse had seen a steady exodus of top private bankers and a drumbeat of asset outflows, which topped US$110 billion in the fourth quarter. Deutsche Bank will not go on a massive hiring spree as part of this push, but will add selectively, Ms Young said.  Based on Asian Private Banker\u2019s estimate of Deutsche Bank\u2019s relationship manager headcount, a 30 per cent increase over five years would translate into roughly 13 hires a year. Deutsche Bank is also reviewing whether to increase the minimum threshold of assets clients need to keep with the bank in Asia, Ms Young said.  The bank\u2019s push for the ultra-rich means it is focusing more on clients with minimum \u20ac50 million of investible assets with the bank, or those with a net worth of at least \u20ac150 million. Hiring has begun across the three core markets in Asia, which comprise North Asia, global and onshore India, as well as South-east Asia, said Ms Young.  North Asia is the biggest of the three, accounting for roughly 40 per cent of the bank\u2019s assets under management in Asia-Pacific. Mr Johanes Oeni, a former managing director at Credit Suisse, started in April to ramp up South-east Asia, the smallest among the three regions in terms of assets and revenue for Deutsche Bank.  Mr Oeni was the Swiss bank\u2019s most senior private banker for Indonesia. Ms Young said she is hiring for the South-east Asia team but declined to spell out the number of headcount planned for the year.  \u201cGrowing for the sake of growing to be on the league table... things can fall through the cracks,\u201d she said.  \u201cThat happens when you try to grow at all costs.\u201d BLOOMBERG",

Apart from UOB, there are two other new tenants \u2013 Target Media Culcreative (TMCC), which has 15,000 digital advertising display panels installed across the island, and Delteq, one of the first local system integrators, set up in 1992. Essentially, system integrators provide clients with all their information technology needs, from network and security to hardware and maintenance. Collaborations between the business park\u2019s tenants are already under way before any of them move in, with several more new initiatives announced by Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong on Tuesday when he introduced the second batch of PDD tenants at an event called Punggol Digital District: Connecting Smartness 2023. These initiatives include the setting up of a fintech innovation lab between UOB and SIT that aims to foster joint innovation, training and development, and applied research. Separately, there is also an agreement between TMCC and SIT to inculcate entrepreneurship through ideation challenges where students come up with digital advertising solutions.  In addition, both UOB and TMCC have internship programmes that will benefit SIT undergraduates through what Mr Gan described as a \u201cfull-fledged applied learning environment\u201d. Mr Gan said Singapore remains an attractive place for technology businesses due to initiatives such as PDD, as the country continues to enhance its value proposition through investment in both infrastructure and the development of human capital. He noted that even with the recent wave of tech layoffs, \u201cour digital economy continues to offer tremendous growth potential and Singapore remains well positioned to weather the current challenges\u201d.  For UOB chief executive officer Wee Ee Cheong, the investment in PDD reinforces \u201cour commitment to grow our Singapore core and support our customers\u201d at home and across Asean.  When the bank\u2019s 300,000 sq ft tower is ready, some 3,000 staff in technology, innovation and digital roles will move in.  In another initiative, UOB and JTC agreed to collaborate in a decarbonisation drive that combines JTC\u2019s strengths and UOB\u2019s sustainability capabilities. They will jointly conduct outreach capacity-building workshops for local industrialists in PDD and beyond. Meanwhile, both TMCC and Delteq are expected to move their operations into the business park by mid-2024 and 2025 respectively.  TMCC chief commercial officer Henry Goh said that he is looking forward to working with SIT students on real-world problems through hackathons that will generate fresh ideas to drive the business. ",

    "context": "HONG KONG \u2013 Microsoft\u2019s Bing may replace Alphabet\u2019s Google as the default search service on Samsung\u2019s devices, according to a New York Times report on Sunday. Samsung Electronics, the world\u2019s leading smartphone-maker, is considering making the switch, putting at risk roughly US$3 billion (S$4 billion) in annual revenue for Google, the report said.  Bing\u2019s threat to Google\u2019s search dominance has grown more credible in recent months, with the addition of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT technology to provide human-like responses to user queries. Samsung shipped 261 million smartphones in 2022, according to IDC data, all running Google\u2019s Android software. The South Korean company has long-established partnerships with both Microsoft and Google, and its devices come preloaded with a library of apps and services from both, such as OneDrive and Google Maps.  Negotiations are still ongoing and Samsung may yet decide to keep Google as its default provider, according to the report. Google is working on several projects to update and renew its search services to avoid losing ground.  These include adding artificial intelligence (AI) features to its existing offerings, under a project named Magi, which has more than 160 people working on it, the Times reported.  Google is \u201cexcited about bringing new AI-powered features to search and will share more details soon\u201d, Google representative Lara Levin said in a statement.  A Google spokesman did not comment on the company\u2019s negotiations with Samsung. A spokesman for Samsung declined to comment. Between its Samsung deal and one with Apple, which the Times report valued at roughly US$20 billion in annual revenue, the search giant has commanding market share in mobile devices in the United States and much of the rest of the world. Large language models (LLMs), such as the one underpinning ChatGPT and the chatbot functionality in Microsoft\u2019s Bing, are not new to Google.  The company has been using LLMs to anticipate the intent of users\u2019 queries, Google\u2019s chief business officer said during the tech giant\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call in February.  Google is also rolling out Bard, its own chatbot search assistant, although it is doing so at a very cautious pace. BLOOMBERG",

    "context": "PETALING JAYA - Malaysians have to brace themselves for increasing haze and heat that could pose major health risks, say health experts. The experts warned that besides discomfort, the current hot and dry weather condition can cause heat stroke, as well as respiratory problems such as asthma.  Public health expert Zainal Ariffin Omar urged the public to take care of themselves by staying hydrated, avoiding outdoor activities in extreme heat and wearing appropriate clothing. \u201cIt is vital to prioritise health and well-being during extreme weather conditions and the necessary precautions should be taken to stay safe,\u201d he said. \u201cUse umbrellas or wear hats while outdoors to avoid exposure to direct sunlight. To beat the heat, people can drink more water and fruit juice, and eat more fruits. \u201cIt is also important to be aware of physical changes, particularly for those at high risk of heat stroke and exhaustion. Although there aren\u2019t many cases of heat stroke in Malaysia, the public should be cautious.\u201d As at 4pm Sunday, the air quality in several districts in Kelantan, Johor and the capital city of Kuala Lumpur was at an unhealthy level, according to Air Pollutant Index (API) readings. The API reading in Segamat of Johor was 152, Cheras in Kuala Lumpur recorded a reading of 106, while Kota Baru and Tanah Merah in Kelantan were at 107 and 104 respectively.  An API of between 101 and 200 indicates unhealthy air quality. Natural Resources, Environment and Climate Change Minister Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad said on Saturday the nation is bracing itself for the return of the haze due to the recent hot and dry conditions. Dr Zainal said that as Covid-19 cases are also on the rise, clinics should be mindful that some symptoms of the virus infection could be similar to those of heat stroke. \u201cDoctors must exercise caution when patients seek advice,\u201d he said.\n Malaysian Chinese Medical Association president Heng Aik Teng reminded people to avoid keeping their air-conditioning at the lowest temperature to allow their body to slowly adapt to the outdoor heat. He also suggested that people drink more water and herbal tea to relieve the heat, adding that many had fallen ill due to changes in the weather.\n \u201cIf people feel dizzy, stuffy and sweaty, it could be a sign of heat stroke. They should seek medical attention immediately,\u201d he advised.\n Ms Andrea Lim, 30, from Cheras, said she noticed the sky was quite hazy on Saturday and decided to put on her mask outdoors. She said the weather had been extremely hot and stuffy over the past few days. \u201cI had to install an additional air cooler because I simply couldn\u2019t sleep at night,\u201d she added.\n Ms Kyra Carvalho, 19, from the upscale Kuala Lumpur suburb of Bangsar, said she noticed the hazy condition in the city centre on Sunday evening. \u201cThere was also a smoky smell in the air,\u201d said the university student, adding that many of her friends also noticed the change in air quality over the past few days. \u201cEven with the air-conditioning on at full blast, it still feels warm,\u201d she said, adding that most of her friends spend their time indoors now. Alliance for Safe Community founder and chairman Lee Lam Thye urged the relevant enforcement agencies to take immediate steps against open burning to stop the haze from getting worse. He said swift action must be taken to prevent the situation from becoming a health hazard.\n \u201cEnforcement cannot solely be the responsibility of the Environment Ministry. It must be a concerted effort by several agencies, including local councils such as City Hall, which has its own health and environment officers,\u201d he added. Tan Sri Lee said there must be an immediate response from enforcement agencies should open burning be detected, and asked the Plantation and Commodities Ministry to help the agricultural sector move away from such activity as a means to clear land.

    "context": "PETALING JAYA \u2013 With a rise in Covid-19 cases in Malaysia of late and more social gatherings for Hari Raya expected in the coming days, public health experts are suggesting that face masks be worn in public.  Individuals at high risk of developing severe Covid-19 include the elderly, the obese, those with high comorbidities and those who are immunocompromised, such as people with diabetes and cancer. \u201cAs such, they are highly encouraged to wear masks,\u201d said public health expert Sharifa Ezat Wan Puteh of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. Professor Sharifa said people who have not completed their vaccination regimen, either with primary vaccination or a booster, should be masked when in public. \u201cIt is better to be safe than sorry. Get yourself vaccinated, including the boosters. If you\u2019re at high risk, wear a mask in public areas where there are many people who may be transmitting or carrying the virus,\u201d she said.\n She also spoke about an upsurge in cases at certain schools, adding that students who are at risk should wear masks. \u201cThe increase in Covid-19 cases is expected, due to a few highly transmissible Omicron strains, unmasking and many of us moving freely across states and in our workplaces,\u201d she noted. \u201cHowever, the main issue is whether the rise in cases will lead to hospitalisation or even deaths.\u201d A statement from Malaysia\u2019s Health Ministry last Thursday said hospital admissions of people with Covid-19 had increased by 17.6 per cent as at the beginning of April, compared with the previous month. Health Minister Zaliha Mustafa said that among those hospitalised, 63.8 per cent were aged 60 and above, and 90.7 per cent had comorbidities.  Most patients had mild symptoms. Deaths among patients who were not vaccinated were six times higher than among those who had received a single vaccine dose, Dr Zaliha added. Professor Moy Foong Ming of Universiti Malaya\u2019s Department of Social and Preventive Medicine suggested that the Health Ministry should intensify its public messages on the importance of wearing masks and encourage people to do so during a surge in cases. As for infections in schools, she said parents should not send children with symptoms to school. \u201cThe school management should be alert to the health status of their staff and students. Take appropriate action when any of the staff or students are unwell,\u201d Prof Moy said. However, the experts are of the view that it is not necessary to make it mandatory for people to wear face masks. Prof Moy said making face masks mandatory is no longer feasible as Malaysia is transitioning to the phase of living with Covid-19 as an endemic disease. \u201cWe are to coexist with the virus. The public should have internalised the preventive measures and should carry them out voluntarily when there is a surge in cases,\u201d she said. \u201cIf masking is made compulsory, then there should be punitive measures on those who don\u2019t comply.  \u201cThis will not educate the public; rather, they will mask up because of fear of possible punitive action taken against them.\u201d  Malaysian Public Health Physicians Association president Zainal Ariffin Omar also believes masking should not be made mandatory but strongly encouraged instead. \u201cI think the public will not be too receptive if mandatory masking and added regulations are imposed,\u201d Dr Zainal said, adding that people should be encouraged to self-test and self-quarantine should they show symptoms. Universiti Putra Malaysia medical epidemiologist Malina Osman said current measures can be maintained, but those who test positive must wear a mask to protect others. \u201cThose who are sick should stay at home and be quarantined. If they need to be in public, wearing a mask is a must,\u201d she said. Associate Professor Malina added that the decision to make masking compulsory should be taken only if the increase in Covid-19 cases poses a threat to the country\u2019s healthcare system. \u201cCurrently, there is no such indication, so there is no urgent need to make it compulsory,\u201d she said. However, there is a need to enhance public awareness so that people can take responsible steps, she added. Prof Malina said the rise in cases is most likely due to the current strain being highly infectious. \u201cIn general, we have to be more cautious. People are encouraged to mask up in public, be mindful of hand hygiene and cough etiquette,\u201d she said. THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK ",

    "context": "SINGAPORE - The death of 43-year-old Filipino helper Ontal Charlene Vargas, four days after she had received a booster dose of Covid-19 vaccination, has been ruled a medical misadventure. Her cause of death, certified as myocarditis, was found by State Coroner Adam Nakhoda as likely to be related to the vaccination, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a statement on Sunday.   Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle which can weaken and impede the overall function of the heart. The condition is a known side effect of the Covid-19 vaccination. Madam Vargas had received her booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty Covid-19\u00a0vaccine on Dec 9, 2021. The next day, she was hospitalised for shortness of breath and chest tightness.  She died on Dec 13, 2021.  A one-time financial assistance of\u00a0$225,000 was extended to Madam Vargas\u2019 family in the Philippines, MOH said. Her family had submitted an application under the Vaccine\u00a0Injury Financial Assistance Programme in January 2023, with an independent panel assessing that her death was related to the Covid-19 vaccination.  This is the highest amount a person can receive through the programme. Madam Vargas\u2019 death is the second related to Covid-19 vaccination locally, said MOH. The first case was a 28-year-old Bangladeshi national who collapsed at his workplace and died of myocarditis on July 9, 2021,\u00a0three weeks after receiving his first dose of the Moderna/Spikevax Covid-19 vaccine. Under Singapore\u2019s National Vaccination Programme, more than 17 million doses of Covid-19 vaccination have been administered.  According to the Health Sciences Authority\u2019s (HSA) latest vaccine safety updates, the incidence of myocarditis remains rare, with reporting rates of 0.1 for every 100,000 doses for the bivalent vaccines, and 1.1 per 100,000 doses for the primary vaccination series of the monovalent vaccines.\u00a0  MOH said available data suggests that most cases of myocarditis following vaccination are generally mild and respond to treatment.  Covid-19 infection is also known to be associated with myocarditis, several times higher than the incidence after\u00a0vaccination.\u00a0\u00a0 Since September 2019, as a precautionary measure, MOH has advised vaccinated persons to avoid strenuous physical activity or exercise for two weeks after vaccination to mitigate the potential risk of myocarditis.  Those who experience chest discomfort, abnormal heartbeat or any other symptoms after vaccination should seek medical attention promptly.  This, MOH said, will enable early diagnosis and appropriate medical\u00a0management of any rare severe adverse events that may occur after vaccination.\u00a0 The ministry said that it will, along with the Expert Committee on Covid-19 Vaccination and\u00a0HSA, continue to monitor vaccine-related serious adverse events closely.

    "context": "SINGAPORE - Though the number of hospitalisations related to Covid-19 is increasing amid a new wave of infections, this is unlikely to overwhelm hospitals here, experts said.  As the variants currently circulating worldwide are much milder than the original Delta strains, the number of patients who need intensive care is unlikely to rise significantly, said Professor Paul Tambyah, a senior consultant in infectious diseases at National University Hospital and president of the International Society for Infectious Diseases.  \u201cWhat we are seeing right now is what has happened with every virus in human history \u2013 over time, they adapt to humans and become more easily transmissible and less virulent,\u201d he added. \u201cEven the deadly \u2018Spanish influenza\u2019 of 1918 which killed one in 50 people worldwide mutated into the most common strain of seasonal influenza which caused seasonal outbreaks every year from 1920 to 1957,\u201d he said, noting that this also appears to be happening with Sars-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19.  Associate Professor\u00a0Alex\u00a0Cook, vice-dean of research at the National University of Singapore Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said: \u201cThe numbers are still much lower than what was observed over the Omicron waves of 2022, so there\u2019s not much cause for concern at the moment.  \u201cWe can expect to see undulating waves like this going forward as immunity rises and falls in the population.\u201d On Friday, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said that Singapore was in the midst of a new wave of Covid-19 infections, with the estimated number of daily cases going up from about 1,400 a month ago to 4,000 last week. About three in 10 of the current cases are reinfections \u2013 higher than the 20 to 25 per cent seen during the last wave. While the number of infections is climbing, there is no evidence that the current strains cause more severe illness, the minister said. The Ministry of Health also stated that the current wave is driven by a mix of XBB subvariants \u2013 such as XBB.1.5, XBB.1.9 and XBB.1.16, also known as Arcturus \u2013 with no evidence of increased severity in cases.\u00a0 According to the MOH website, there were 16,108 reported cases in the first week of April. During that period, there were 424 people hospitalised due to Covid-19, with nine warded in the intensive care unit (ICU).  An average of four adult ICU beds were occupied daily by Covid-19 patients during that time, MOH data showed.   Prof Tambyah cited several possible reasons for the rise in infections.  These include increased travel over the March school holidays as well as the Good Friday long weekend, which could have helped introduce new strains of the coronavirus to the population, as well as waning immunity from vaccinations.  MOH data shows that demand for hospital beds remains high, with the daily occupancy rate at public hospitals ranging between 81.6 per cent and 100 per cent over the past week.  The waiting time for admission to ward from the emergency department also remained high at some hospitals here.  Still, the current Covid-19 wave has yet to overwhelm the hospitals as Singapore has so far not turned to private hospitals or makeshift facilities to handle the increase in cases, infectious diseases expert Dr Leong Hoe Nam said.  Should more people be hospitalised, the country can adopt measures it took earlier in the pandemic \u2013 such as cutting down on elective surgeries and building temporary facilities, Dr Leong said, adding that there is so far no reason to reintroduce measures such as mandatory mask-wearing.   Singapore has seen more than 2.2 million cases of Covid-19 since the pandemic began in early 2020, with more than 1,700 deaths.  During that time, the country introduced a slew of measures, including mandatory mask-wearing, contact tracing and restrictions on gatherings.  Prof Tambyah said that given its status as one of the most connected cities in the world, Singapore is likely to see infections caused by all new variants that will emerge over the next few years, though these are likely to remain largely of academic interest as the world gets used to living with the virus.
