    "author(s)": "By Alexander R Arifianto",
    "date": "No. 108 \u2013 13 July 2021",
    "content": "ON 1 JULY 2021, Indonesian president Joko Widodo (\u2018Jokowi\u2019) announced the enactment of an Emergency Pandemic Mitigation Measure (PPKM Darurat), in response to the worst COVID-19 surge the nation has experienced since the World Health Organisation declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic in March 2020. The measure, with effect from 2 to 20 July 2021, puts the entire Java and Bali region under a strict lockdown. It is Indonesia\u2019s first strict lockdown since the virus was detected in the country in March. All non-essential businesses are required to be conducted entirely from home, all shopping malls located on the two islands are closed, and all dine-in service in restaurants and hawkers are suspended, with only take-home delivery allowed. Mixed Vaccination Record The new measure was enacted after Indonesia\u2019s confirmed COVID-19 cases grew exponentially during much of last month \u2500 from a low of 4,821 cases on 1 June to an all time high of 40,427 cases on 12 July. It also reached a record death toll of 1,040 on 7 July. The Jokowi administration states that the goal of PPKM Darurat is to reduce the number of daily cases to less than 10,000 per day and to reduce hospitalisation and death numbers. On 12 July, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati indicated that the government planned to extend the emergency measure by up to six weeks, since there were no signs of a slowdown in the rise of new cases. Over the past six months Indonesia had focused much of its COVID-19 mitigation effort to procuring enough vaccines for its nearly 270 million citizens and to vaccinate them as soon as possible. So far Indonesia has largely relied on the Sinovac vaccine, which comprises 90 percent of jabs administered since Indonesia\u2019s vaccination programme started last February. Due to concerns that the vaccine is less effective \u2500 especially against the Delta COVID-19 variant that currently is widespread in Indonesia \u2500 the government is rapidly diversifying its vaccine stock by procuring additional vaccines from other providers with scientifically-proven higher efficacy rate. So far Indonesia has acquired 8.2 million doses of Astra Zeneca vaccine through the COVAX global collaboration scheme and plans to obtain an additional 10 million doses through the scheme. It has purchased 50 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which is scheduled to arrive in August 2021. The United States government recently announced it will donate four million doses of Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine in response to the ongoing surge in Indonesia. However, Indonesia\u2019s vaccination programme is being rolled out at a very slow pace, with an average daily vaccination rate of 718,000 \u2500 far below the government\u2019s newly revised vaccination target of two million vaccinations per day by August 2021. Managing Political Fallout: Jokowi\u2019s Legacy? To further bolster vaccination take-up, the government has extended vaccine eligibility to all adults over 18 years old. It has also removed the residency requirement so citizens no longer have to obtain their vaccines in the same district or city which issues their national identity card. It was a factor which has contributed to the slow vaccination rate within the past few months. Most importantly, the government has mobilised members of the Indonesian Armed Forces (TNI) and the National Police (POLRI) to help extend the reach of its vaccination programme, particularly in remote Indonesian regions like the Seribu Archipelago. Sources consulted by the Indonesia Programme indicated that Jokowi is increasingly concerned the ongoing COVID-19 surge in Indonesia could threaten his political legacy after he leaves office in 2024. The president\u2019s major policy moves during his second term, such as last year\u2019s enactment of the Omnibus Law on Job Creation and the construction of Indonesia\u2019s new capital in East Kalimantan province, are potentially threatened if the country\u2019s citizens increasingly view his administration\u2019s COVID-19 response to be largely chaotic, uncoordinated, and half-hearted. Jokowi has appointed Luhut Panjaitan, Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment, as chairman of a new special task force to supervise the Emergency Pandemic Mitigation policy. This indicates that as the ongoing surge increasingly threatens his legacy, Jokowi is placing more trust on Luhut \u2500 his long-time political ally and confidant \u2500 more than on any other member of his cabinet. Luhut\u2019s appointment is also perceived as a rebuke to the co-chairmen of the government\u2019s special task force on COVID-19 mitigation, respectively Airlangga Hartarto (Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs) and Erick Thohir (Minister of State-owned Enterprises), who have led the government\u2019s COVID-19 mitigation strategy since December 2020. While both men were successful in procuring more vaccines for Indonesia\u2019s COVID- 19 vaccination programme, neither paid much attention to dramatically scaling up the vaccination programme's testing and tracing system, and to establish an effective isolation and quarantine scheme. Altogether these have made Indonesia unprepared to deal with the ongoing virus surge. Decisive Leader? The ongoing COVID-19 surge in Indonesia is a consequence of the government\u2019s lackadaisical pandemic mitigation strategy over the past 16 months. Worsening it is the slow vaccination rollout, as well as the continuing mixed messaging on whether it prioritises public health or economic development. Since the surge is threatening to further undermine his popularity, Jokowi has concluded that a short yet effective strict lockdown of Java and Bali, combined with a faster rollout of the vaccines, would be a fitting response while protecting his public image and political legitimacy. If the emergency measure is successful to significantly reduce new COVID-19 cases and fatalities, it would showcase Jokowi as a decisive leader in the country\u2019s worst public health emergency. How his administration handles the pandemic and minimises its adverse impact on the Indonesian society is the most important legacy of his presidency."

    "title": "Russo-US Ties Under the Biden Presidency",
    "author(s)": "By Chris Cheang",
    "date": "No. 210 \u2013 18 December 2020",
    "content": "immediately extend his AS EXPECTED, President Vladimir Putin did not congratulations to President-elect Joe Biden after the US presidential election in late November. Putin was quoted as saying that he was ready to work with any US leader, \u201cwho has the confidence of the American people\u201d. He added \u201cthat confidence can only be given to a candidate whose victory has been recognised by the opposing party, or after the results are confirmed in a legitimate, legal way\u201d. In response to a media question, Putin replied bluntly that the move would not damage relations as \u201cthey\u2019re already ruined\u201d. By taking a different approach from other world powers, President Putin appears convinced that Russia\u2019s relationship with the US is unlikely to worsen any further under the Biden presidency, despite the latter\u2019s well-known and long-standing negative perception of Russia under his leadership. Biden\u2019s View of Putin and Russia During his visit to Moscow in March 2011, then Vice President Biden reportedly told then Prime Minister Putin that he did not have a soul; Biden also reportedly conveyed to Russian opposition leaders his view that it would be better for Russia if Putin did not run for re-election in 2012 (President Putin had stepped down from the presidency in 2008 in accordance with a two-term constitutional limit, making way for Dmitry Medvedev to be elected as president). President-elect Biden\u2019s negative view of Russia was reiterated in an interview with CBS News\u2019 60 Minutes on 26 October when he reportedly said that he considered Russia \u201cthe biggest threat to America right now in terms of breaking up our security and our alliances\u201d. President Putin therefore has good reasons to distrust the US president-elect, unlike President Donald Trump, for whom he has had words of praise, which Trump reciprocated. Yet under the Trump administration, Russia\u2019s purported initial hopes of a normalisation of relations not only proved groundless but became worse, for the following reasons: US Sanctions on Russia: President Putin has repeatedly condemned US sanctions on Russia; in late October at a business conference, he noted that \u201cthe current administration has imposed sanctions on Russia 46 times on our companies and economic operators, which is the highest number ever\u201d. It is questionable whether the Biden administration would lift these sanctions. US Pressure on NATO Allies: President Trump\u2019s unrelenting pressure on the US\u2019 NATO allies to increase their defence budgets was certainly neither in Russia\u2019s economic nor security interests. According to a Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) April 2020 study, \u201cRussia\u2019s military burden in 2019 was much higher than that of China and the other large European spenders and slightly higher than that of the USA\u201d. Since NATO is considered its principal military threat, any increase in NATO countries\u2019 defence budgets is not in Russia\u2019s security (or economic) interest. Moreover, President Trump\u2019s consistent calls for increased US defence spending can only have been seen in Russia as another threat to its own defence and security posture. The Biden presidency is unlikely to reverse course on this matter as it strengthens the NATO alliance. Arms Control Treaties and Confidence-Building Measures: The US\u2019 withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty and the Open Skies Treaty, as well as its lukewarm response to repeated Russian suggestions to renew the New START Treaty which expires in February 2021, have not been met with Russian approval. Moscow sees these actions as threatening to Russian security and defence interests in Europe and its nuclear security posture. While the Biden presidency might renew the New START Treaty, that remains to be seen. Sale of Javelin Anti-tank Missiles to Ukraine: The Obama administration had reportedly refused this step which the Trump administration approved in March 2018. This weapon is considered a deterrent to any Russian military action against Ukraine directly or in support of the Ukrainian separatists. The Biden presidency is unlikely to change course as it would not want to relieve any military pressure on or weaken deterrence measures against Russia. US Opposition to Nord Stream II Gas Pipeline: President Trump\u2019s criticism of Germany\u2019s continued support of this project, and US sanctions on the project, touch on Russia\u2019s gas industry, which is a key part of its economy. President Trump has consistently stated that while the US \u201cprotected\u201d Germany from Russia, Germany continued to pay Russia \u201cbillions of dollars for energy coming from a pipeline\u201d. Russia believes the US wants to eliminate competition to its gas exports to Europe; a Bloomberg report dated  16 July 2020 quoted President Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that US sanctions were \u201can attempt to force Europeans to buy more expensive gas under less attractive conditions\". The Biden presidency is unlikely to reverse this policy which has wide support among Republicans as well as Democrats. US Sanctions on Iran: President Trump\u2019s hardline policy towards Iran has also been met with criticism by Moscow. Geographically close, Russia desires a stable Iran without access to nuclear weapons technology. Russia also has economic, energy and security interests with respect to Iran. President Trump\u2019s policy jeopardised these interests. The possibility of the US rejoining the nuclear deal on Iran under the Biden presidency cannot be ruled out but US hostility towards Iran would still remain strong. Russia Unlikely to Worsen Ties President Putin will want to ascertain how the Biden presidency approaches all these issues, especially the Democratic Party\u2019s perception that Russia interfered on Trump\u2019s behalf in the 2016 election, and principally whether the Biden presidency would introduce punitive actions against Russia on this score. Putin can therefore be expected not to undertake any move that might make an already bad relationship worse. An indication of his instinct for the need to change course can be seen in his reported remarks on President-elect Biden\u2019s son\u2019s apparent business dealings in Ukraine. According to media reports in late October, he was quoted as saying that: \"I don\u2019t see anything criminal about this, at least we don\u2019t know anything about this (being criminal),\" referring to the younger Biden\u2019s apparent business dealings in Ukraine. His position stands in direct contrast to President Trump\u2019s. Equally significant is the role and pressure of domestic politics. Currently, the COVID- 19 situation has already claimed over 48,000 lives while infections stand at over 2.7 million with over two million recovered cases. Putin\u2019s energy and time will continue to be focussed on dealing with the pandemic\u2019s socio-political, health as well as economic consequences. He can ill-afford to leave it entirely to the cabinet and governors. He also would not want to end his current term of office in 2024 still grappling with the pandemic\u2019s consequences. Putin would be cognisant that a further deterioration in relations with the US would force Russia further into the arms of China. No Russian leader can afford to lead his country to further dependence on Chinese goodwill and economic largesse. Moreover, Russia\u2019s position as a balancer between the US and China would be weakened, if its already bad relationship with the US were to worsen under the Biden presidency."

    "title": "A New WTO Chief: Director or General?",
    "author(s)": "By Evan Rogerson",
    "date": "No. 040 \u2013 5 March 2021",
    "content": "LEADERLESS FOR almost a year, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) has a new director-general from 1 March 2021. Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala\u2019s appointment has attracted considerable attention, not only because she is the first woman and the first African to head the WTO, but also because of hopes that she can reboot the troubled global trade body. How realistic are those expectations and how much difference can the new DG make? Experience suggests the answer: less than many outside observers may expect, but enough to be significant given even moderately positive external circumstances. Director or General? The basic point about the post of DG is that it has no formal power apart from heading the Secretariat. With its origins in the improvised arrangements of the GATT, the WTO has not managed to become a full-fledged international organisation on the level of its Bretton Woods sisters, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the World Bank. Member governments jealously protect the \u201cmember-driven\u201d principle and push back at any suspicion of overreach by the Secretariat or its head. In a far more favourable time for the WTO, DG Renato Ruggiero (1995-99) was rebuffed by members for attempting to call meetings that were seen as beyond his mandate. Frustration at this and similar constraints contributed to his decision not to seek a second term. Unlike the European Commission, the WTO Secretariat, and its director-general, have no power of initiative. Furthermore, all significant decisions are taken by members, on the basis of consensus. Unlike the World Bank or IMF, it does not control important financial resources or a network of representatives around the world. It is small, less than 700 people, based only in Geneva, and dependent on annual approval by members of its modest budget. The reality of these limits contrasts strikingly with the myth of the WTO as a powerful and unaccountable body fostered by critics and by governments eager to offload their own responsibilities, like the Trump administration blaming the WTO for its China problem. Relying on DG\u2019s Soft Power Despite the post\u2019s lack of hard power or even a defined role, some past DGs have been able to exercise considerable influence by skilful use of the various forms of soft power that it potentially offers. The incumbent normally has a high public profile and access to senior political levels as well as to key global forums like the G20. This means that the DG should be well placed to show the sort of leadership in defending the multilateral system that has been largely absent in its present crisis. The advocacy role extends to media involvement as well. The DG is the only person who can credibly claim to speak for the WTO as a whole, though always under the watchful eyes of member governments. The DG\u2019s convening power is also important, though it is not unlimited. It was further limited by the previous DG\u2019s renunciation of the use of the \u201cGreen Room\u201d, which had been depicted in a sinister light. It was in fact simply a process of informal consultation by the DG with ad hoc groups of members to resolve particular issues. The new DG would be well advised to make use of it again, whatever she chooses to call it. A Balancing Act The DG has to strike a careful balance between the global face of the role and the need to cultivate the Geneva WTO Ambassadors. Their reporting and advice inform government positions, and DGs who have failed to sustain good working relationships with them have been less effective. In particular, the DG\u2019s relationship with the annually elected Chair of the General Council is critical. Peter Sutherland, who oversaw the conclusion of the Uruguay Round and became the WTO\u2019s first DG, described the role as that of a facilitator. The key prerequisite for success in this role is trust. A DG who succeeds in establishing themselves as an honest broker can have a crucial, though always necessarily discreet, influence on the course of negotiations and on the confidence that members have in the organisation. At critical points in past negotiations members have often turned to the DG to help find solutions and broker compromises. They need to be able to do so again. WTO\u2019s Heady Challenges The issues that the WTO faces now are fundamental ones. Is it still possible to negotiate multilaterally? The fisheries subsidies and agriculture processes are not encouraging. If plurilateral approaches are more promising, how are they to be reconciled with the multilateral system? India and South Africa have recently fired warning shots about their legal standing. One immediate issue is how the WTO can best assist recovery from COVID. A potential tussle over intellectual property rights and vaccines is something the DG will have to approach more carefully than her recent statements suggest. Looking further ahead, the relationship between trade rules and climate change will also be an increasingly important focus of Dr Okonjo-Iweala\u2019s term. There is little sign that the WTO system is prepared for the challenge. WTO Reform: Much Touted, Little Understood WTO reform is much touted but little understood. The new DG is committed to advancing it, but the key issues involved arise from the deepest fissures in the global trade and economic landscape-the US-China confrontation, the future of developing- country status, the credibility and enforceability of WTO rules. It will not be easy to bridge these gaps without some improved understanding among key governments. Sutherland was able to broker the deal that concluded the Uruguay Round not only because of his own great skills but also because the key players were ready to do a deal. This is far from being the case now. The atmospherics may have improved somewhat with the change of US administration, but the substantive issues remain. No one should expect the DG to solve deep-seated international problems with major implications for domestic politics. However, if Dr Okonjo-Iweala succeeds in establishing herself as an impartial facilitator, she may be able to play a crucial role in the bridge-building that has to take place across the membership spectrum. Everything depends on the willingness of governments to work within, rather than against, the multilateral system."

    "title": "Maintaining Harmony: Indonesia\u2019s Inter-Religious Forum",
    "author(s)": "By Jonathan Chen",
    "date": "No. 038 \u2013 12 March 2020",
    "content": "IN THE wake of an escalation of conflicts between religious communities over sacred sites and places of worship, the Inter-Religious Harmony Forum (commonly known as FKUB or Forum Kerukunan Umat Beragama) was established in 2006. It was initiated by a Joint Regulation of the Minister of Religion and the Minister of Home Affairs to provide an advisory role at the provincial, regency and city levels on matters of inter- religious relations. Seen largely as a consulting body, its primary role had been to arbitrate across religious lines and recommend approval of new houses of worship from all six officially recognised religions (Islam, Catholicism, Protestantism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism) in Indonesia. Its other duties are to advise on local regulations (peraturan daerah), decrees (surat keputusan) and circulars (surat edaran) related to matters of religion. Majority\u2019s Inherent Advantage The Forum, since its conception, had been accused of privileging bureaucratisation over being a platform where the aspirations of all religions could be manifested. Consisting of at least 21 members, the Forums are skewed towards favouring the dominant religion in each region. This means that most regions in Java and Sumatra have greater numbers of Muslim members while provinces like North Sulawesi and East Nusa Tenggara have more Christian members appointed by the local chief executives (governors, regents, or mayors). For example, in the East Java FKUB, Muslims number eleven out of the 21 members consisting of a representative each from organisations like Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), Muhammadiyah and the Indonesian Ulama Council (MUI), giving Islam a simple majority amongst the religions. This often translates into Islamic votes overruling other minority votes, in the case of East Java. In addition, while the Forum\u2019s religious minority members may object to a ruling by refusing to sign the official statement issued by the group, key decisions were often already made by the governor with advice from MUI. For instance, in 2012 the East Java FKUB issued a statement condemning Shi\u2019a Muslims as heretics, in accordance with the East Java MUI fatwa and the decree issued by former Governor Soekarwo. Even though representatives from minority groups refused to sign the statement, it was still released as an official statement of the East Java Forum. Informal Decrees and Circulars Within the past few years, there was a conversion in the type of legal status for local religious regulations that saw an increase in less formal but still legally binding regulations. These took the form of decrees (surat keputusan) and circulars (surat edaran), in comparison to formal regulations (peraturan daerah or in short perda). This shift is seen as a strategic move by groups to make sure that regulations are harder to detect by the Ministry of Home Affairs or human rights and religious minority watchdog groups. Such informal decrees and circulars are usually issued by local executives such as the governor, regent or mayor and would often first be delegated to the local agency (dinas) most relevant to the topic. Unlike that of a perda, which needed to be discussed and approved by the provincial legislature (DRPD I) or district/city council (DPRD II), decrees and circulars are exempted and only require the signature of the local executive. In other words, these informal regulations do not require legislative consent and approval or checks and balances, resting solely on the prerogative of the local executive and bureaucracy. It is thus common for religious power brokers to request and lobby for the passage of these informal regulations. Local executives are often willing to approve these requests in order to ensure electoral support. Most civil servants and bureaucrats also see these as devices to execute the wishes of local executives, thus few are willing to express disagreements for fear of facing retaliatory actions from the executives themselves. Thus a decree or circular to ban people from celebrating Valentine\u2019s Day or holding Christmas Service for example, can be implemented within a short time. Local governments will deny the existence of such regulations as these informal regulations take the form of voluntary compliance (himbauan). On the other hand, these informal decrees and circulars are also more likely to violate national laws. For example, the East Java governor\u2019s decree to limit Ahmadiyah activities in the province violates both the 1945 Indonesian constitution and the Law on Human Rights. Strategies to Protect Religious Minorities and Beliefs While it may seem that the odds are stacked against religious minorities, especially that of indigenous beliefs (kepercayaan) or sects considered deviant (Ahmadis and Shi\u2019a Muslims), there are viable strategies that they can take to protect themselves, depending upon the context. For example, Indonesian Hindus practising their faith openly can opt to identify themselves more as a \u2018cultural group\u2019 (known as aliran kepercayaan) which are perceived as less of a threat by Muslim hardliners. Christians, in a hostile environment, can be more attuned when promoting tolerance, by choosing not to use overtly religious rhetoric or take the approach of addressing more general issues concerning honesty, inequality and injustice that are also of concern to Muslims. While the FKUB may not be a perfect vehicle for all occasions, harmony can oftentimes be achieved in various contexts without recourse to arbitration or legislation if sensitivity is respected. A minority religious group may not have to rely on state apparatuses if a delicate balance of tolerance, depending on the context can be achieved. This means not ruling out innovative strategies or adopting less invasive methods in order to protect the peace."

    "title": "Global Health Security: COVID-19 & Its Impacts Pandemic & Welfare Policies: Doling Out the Digital",
    "author(s)": "By Amalina Anuar",
    "date": "No. 166 \u2013 2 September 2020",
    "content": "COVID-19\u2019s SOCIO-ECONOMIC costs are mounting. Assessing cumulative damage is an ongoing process, but it suffices to say that the economic contractions underway are unprecedented since the 1930\u2019s Great Depression. With the fallout unevenly distributed, economically insecure populations are likely to bear the brunt of pandemic- induced shocks. Taking the edge off this suffering will thus require improving welfare delivery well into an increasingly digital age. How then can countries in the region better deliver social assistance, such as caregiving and medicine, through technology as they accelerate digital transformations in the new normal? Need for Rethinking on Social Safety Nets For one, digital welfare assistance may involve ensuring social wellbeing in hitherto less regulated segments of the digital economy. The gig economy is a prime example. Many workers in this growing sector lack welfare coverage, a gap which can perhaps be plugged using technology. So far, governments have taken to combating potential unemployment with subsidised wages, incentivising businesses to keep employees on their payroll. It is questionable, however, whether layoffs can continue to be kept at bay. Social safety nets contingent on traditional employment models thus need rethinking, especially since recessions are not the only job loss-catalysts on the horizon. The pandemic will end. Trends such as automation still loom large. COVID-19 has thus exposed how unprepared countries are even for anticipated scenarios. ASEAN\u2019s Gig Economy & Social Safety Many countries are in the nascent stages of regulating how gig workers fit into social safety schemes. Across ASEAN, gig workers are unprotected under respective Employment Acts albeit countries such as Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines have rolled out certain provisions to soften the blow of work-related risks and improve worker resilience. Uncertainty underpins this regulatory lag. Gig workers are a catch-all category that covers freelance professionals and low-wage labour with varying degrees of financial literacy and economic security. Debate persists over who qualifies as a gig worker, and hence should receive employment-associated benefits like health insurance or employee fund contributions. Even where governments have agreed to distribute aid to all gig workers during the pandemic, they were often thwarted by missing tax records and their linked bank account details. Certain digital platforms do not provide information on earnings, which makes it difficult for workers to substantiate income loss claims. Elsewhere, gig workers struggle with low financial literacy and awareness of how to file taxes, insufficient digital literacy obstructing access to these programs, and patchy universal internet access. Using Technology for Long-Term Social Protection In the throes of this pandemic, technology could also be deployed more efficiently for social protection purposes to manage its long-run effects on top of immediate health crises. Though data on infections is taking centre-stage, collecting real-time, interoperable datasets on most vulnerable populations could facilitate targeted assistance where urgency is critical. Similarly, this would allow for follow up on the effectiveness of and challenges to fully using distributed aid. Another option is to further harness technology to flatten the emerging post-pandemic mental health curve. Policies availing widespread, online mental health support would complement current telemedicine efforts that more generally address physical ailments. Where mental health issues remain stigmatised, awareness campaigns may prove useful. Going forward then, digital welfare transitions should entail better integration and synergy between online and offline elements. Where absent, universal healthcare coverage would shift risks off economically insecure individuals in the gig economy, while those financially able could choose additional market-based welfare solutions if desired. Allowing self-contributions to employee funds and upskilling courses, as Malaysia and Singapore demonstrate, could be similarly beneficial. Another example is providing work-related insurance, since market actors generally shy away from insuring high-risk individuals in the informal economy. Economic, financial and digital literacy should be better incorporated into education syllabi, whereas data sharing between platforms and governments, meanwhile, could address information gaps vis-\u00e0-vis income claims. Affordable, accessible and quality universal internet access is fundamental, but improving infrastructure takes time and resources. Low-tech solutions should not be shunned in the interim. Offline aid distribution is an inescapable reality where digital connectivity is lacking. ASEAN: Sustaining Welfare Spending Post-Pandemic Where mobile Internet connectivity exceeds broadband penetration across much of ASEAN, governments could roll out aid through singular platforms designed for low speed connections and low spec (low performance) mobile phones, in a similar vein to apps such as Facebook Lite. This could streamline access to patchwork social safety initiatives, which is a problem with non-interoperable datasets such as in Indonesia, while avoiding overlap of welfare coverage. Digitalisation in this context should nonetheless proceed with caution to ensure privacy protection, as well as institutional checks and balances to avoid abuses stemming from data concentration in a single ministry or office. ASEAN countries could further make moves to sustain increased welfare spending post-pandemic. Despite the rise of mental health issues, social spending on that front lags, with mental healthcare belatedly being classified as an essential service in places such as Singapore. For several ASEAN members, financing will be a challenge to delivering on these public goods amidst a global economic environment marked by, inter alia, protectionism and investment uncertainty. ASEAN should, in this manner, continue to pursue economic multilateralism to navigate economic turbulence and leverage collective resilience. Faultlines of Inequality: No Panacea Perhaps more importantly, the social \u2014 and necessarily human \u2014 spirit should not be excised as countries undertake greater digital transformation. There are risks that come with delegating socioeconomic regulation to algorithms and automated systems. Many of these technologies can carry the biases of their creators. Data can be insufficient and incorrect, and models too \u2014 whether technological or socioeconomic. Technology is an enabler, and improving the state of digital welfare can go some way in plugging the gaps of existing socioeconomic systems. Transitioning towards a more socioeconomically just new normal, however, will require more than that. Ultimately, technology is no substitute for remaking the economic systems that, both by misuse and design, exacerbate the faultlines of inequality and social vulnerabilities in the first place."

    "author(s)": "By Muhammad Faizal Abdul Rahman & Gulizar Haciyakupoglu",
    "date": "No. 119 \u2013 12 June 2020",
    "content": "GOVERNMENTS AROUND the globe are launching contact tracing applications in their fight against COVID-19. These contact-tracing applications come with various levels of data collection, data privacy and security practices. Some applications are mandatory while others are voluntary. This global trend engenders concerns about privacy and the potential use of these tools after the pandemic. These concerns emerge as a factor preventing the optimal rate of adoption of applications and branch into debates if they could be better marketed, or whether they work. An Oxford study suggested that contact tracing applications need at least 60% adoption rate to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Contact Tracing Landscape The landscape is diverse as countries design contact-tracing applications with different levels of technical features, and legal frameworks for privacy protection. State policy towards privacy is a significant factor that could affect how entrenched any surveillance technology would be in a country\u2019s social governance. In India, the Aarogya Setu contact tracing application was launched as voluntary but subsequently enforced on \u201ccentral government\u201d employees and staff of some private companies. The application\u2019s privacy policy and terms of service lack transparency on how it \"tracks and stores location data\". India\u2019s proposed Data Protection Bill (2019) has been criticised for \u201coversupply[ing] government intervention and strengthen[ing] the state.\u201d In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides a degree of legal protection against any infringement of data privacy by contact tracing applications. In Singapore, the TraceTogether application is designed with transparency and privacy in mind. The source-code of the TraceTogether is made open-source, and it is available for interested parties to audit. The global research community has begun initiatives to help improve privacy. However, the extent to which governments would go to enhance the privacy and security of their contact-tracing applications remains a question. But how would people feel if they gain nothing from sacrificing more privacy (and face more cyber-attack risks) than they agreed? Contact Tracing Beyond Healthcare? While discussions over privacy continue, another related issue is about expanding the reach of contact tracing applications to people who lack smartphone access. For instance, Singapore is deliberating the distribution of a wearable contact-tracing device to everyone in the country. Singapore has also implemented SafeEntry as a mandatory national check-in/check- out system for high-risk venues such as shopping malls. As countries ease lockdown restrictions, a more extensive reach is crucial to preventing COVID-19 resurgence. The use of multiple contact-tracing tools raises the question of how data from various platforms could be mined for predictive analysis, and inform government policies during and after the pandemic. For instance, could and should the data be used to predict potential future clusters? Would it be in the public interest if governments expand the use of the data beyond healthcare to other aspects of social governance, or not? What would happen if the government leverages the data for forecasting in non-COVID related areas such as crime prevention and social management? Technology & Social Discontent Scenarios Social discontent is set to worsen as COVID-19-related restrictions cause widespread economic disruptions. In the United States, masses have poured to the streets to protest against these restrictions. The ideological leanings of some protest groups are under scrutiny. The World Economic Forum foresees a \"prolonged recession of the global economy\" and social discontent over the next 18 months. Many countries are likely to see a surge in dissatisfaction over livelihood matters. To anticipate plausible dangers, imagine a hypothetical country where citizens demand government interventions in the aftermath of this major crisis. However, the government is running out of resources and scales back on support measures that should be easing socioeconomic pressures. Some citizens resort to petty crime or undesirable activities to mitigate these pressures. These people eschew the use of contact-tracing applications, given the perceived risk of police detection, arrest, and shame. Consequently, they become a vector of undetected community transmission in a new wave of COVID-19. \u2018Sousveillance\u2019: Watching the Watchers In another scenario, some segments of the society are more severely hit by the pandemic. People in low-wage and low-skilled sectors, the gig economy, and the unemployed are in the most precarious state. Economist Guy Standing argues that a person in these circumstances \u201c\u2026 lives in public spaces but is vulnerable to surveillance and undemocratic nudging.\u201d The angrier ones in these groups may find it harder to subjugate their privacy to state surveillance. They embrace \u201csousveillance\u201d such as filming police officers on duty. This counterculture of watching the watchers can be a form of protest. The hypothetical government sees these groups as potential sources of unrest, hence a \u201cthreat\u201d that should be contained. A possible reaction by some governments to \u201csousveillance\u201d is to implement more means of surveillance. This possibility underpins concerns over the uncertainty around the duration of the use of contact-tracing applications. Would some governments repurpose these tools for surveillance to clamp down on potential sources of and actual unrest? While there would be agitators with malicious intent, some may participate in unrest out of social and financial desperation. The questions posed here call for attention to issues that are more complex and go beyond debating human-security. COVID-19 affects national conditions, but more importantly, it affects the welfare of the fundamental elements of a nation \u2013 the individual. As surveillance technology becomes increasingly entrenched in social governance, governments should also use it in an empathetic way and uphold individual rights and privacy."

    "title": "The Biden-Moon Summit: Double Illusions?",
    "author(s)": "By Adam Garfinkle",
    "date": "No. 099 \u2013 25 June 2021",
    "content": "ON 21 MAY 2021, South Korean President Moon Jae-in visited President Joe Biden at the White House, following Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga\u2019s 16 April visit by about five weeks. The unmistakable East Asian accent of the first face-to-face bilateral summits with the recently installed US president clearly ushered in a new era of Sinocentric US foreign policy. That\u2019s where the parallel between the Suga and Moon visits ends, however. The Suga summit was a limited success based on core agreement on essential strategic interests. The Moon visit was \u201cspun\u201d into a manufactured success that skirted persistent if evolving frictions in the bilateral relationship. Moon\u2019s 'Success' President Moon contributed to \u201csuccess\u201d by trimming his ideological sails in hopes of getting a political boost for his unpopular party in the presidential election scheduled for May 2022. He pledged US$40 billion in high-tech US investment and agreed that South Korean and US forces in South Korea should be better integrated into the broader US regional strategy whose focus is deterrence of China. He thus signed on to the US view of deterrence first, diplomacy second, so acknowledged that no Biden-Kim summits are likely before the South Korean election. Moon got what he came for: 550,000 COVID vaccine doses for the South Korean military. Washington also dropped agreed limits in range and payload on South Korean missiles in effect since 1979. Relatedly, the two sides affirmed their intention to progress towards the transfer of operational military command (OPCOM, in alliance lingo) of the 27,500 US troops in South Korea from US to South Korean (ROK) auspices. The US contribution to \u201csuccess\u201d resided in the fact that US officials consider Moon a lame duck president better waited out than accommodated. His approval rating hovers at around 30 percent and polls show key Democratic Party (DP) policy views to be broadly unpopular. The likely election of a rival Peoples Power Party (PPP) government in May 2022, US officials think, will bring ROK policy into line with that of Japan and the US. Differences That Matter Several differences between the current state of the US-Japan and US-South Korea alliances throw light on the two summits\u2019 outcomes, and illustrate the oddities of the US-ROK relationship. Since the neo-totalitarian aspirations of the Xi Jinping regime became clear, Japanese officials have favoured more muscular US deterrence postures. Trump seemed an improvement over the second Obama administration, but Biden\u2019s election raised concern over a regression. The Biden administration\u2019s \u201cextreme competition\u201d posture seemed to have let to some relief in Tokyo. South Korea under Moon has taken the opposite position. Instead of pushing Washington, Seoul has strived to avoid being pushed by it. This leaves it free to essentially appease China in hopes that Beijing would pressure North Korea to accommodate Moon\u2019s denuclearisation and unification line. Moon\u2019s extended \u201cSunshine\u201d policy view, originally promulgated in 1998 by President Kim Dae-jung, could hardly differ more from Japan\u2019s stoic realism. The North Korea Factor Japanese leaders know that North Korea will shed its nuclear weapons under only two conditions: a crisis of unknown provenance that destroys the current regime; and the increasingly remote possibility that the Kim dynasty would trade its ultima ratio for a US security guarantee against China. President Moon, on the other hand, is ideologically committed to the proposition that the North wants to denuclearise, formally end the Korean War and normalise its relations with the US. His intra-Korean reconciliation diplomacy, punctuated by Moon\u2019s repeated urging that US leaders reduce sanctions against North Korea and conduct new US-DPRK summits he can influence \u2500 like the Trump-Kim Summits in Singapore and Hanoi \u2500 is designed to lubricate his vision of denuclearised reunification and earn him the historic-scale political credit he dreams of. So while Japan desires maximally robust US deterrence capabilities nearby, DP leaders hold US military deployments in and around Korea responsible for harming efforts to conciliate with North Korea. Moon has said calming things about the US, but he would dissolve or radically reorient the US-ROK alliance if he could. Since he cannot, he seeks South Korean control over its own military options mainly to ensure that ROK forces are never actually called on to fight. Competing Errors Moon\u2019s view is somewhere between an error and a fantasy, as are his related assumptions that China favours a unified Korea and would countenance the end of the North Korean nuclear programme. But most US analysts believe that the continued presence of US ground troops in South Korea still serves a benign tripwire function despite the end of the Cold War, the rusting of North Korea\u2019s conventional military capabilities, and its presumed ability to strike the continental US with nuclear weapons. That belief, the reification of a decades-old mental habit, also now qualifies as something between error and fantasy. US ground troops in South Korea stoke anti-Americanism, contribute to the polarisation of ROK politics and thus enable DP ideologues to occupy the Blue House. They also make plump targets for North Korean artillery in the event of a major military crisis, so actually hamstring US options in such a crisis. Their presence nevertheless guarantees major US involvement in another war in Korea regardless of whether it serves any vital US national security interest. In sum, they constitute a strategic liability for the US. So the 21 May Biden-Moon Summit was that oddest of birds in statecraft: two sides hewing either obsessively or habitually to conflicting points of view that nevertheless spite their own interests. Needed: A More Flexible US Regional Security Posture The Biden administration should have welcomed Moon\u2019s desire to reconfigure the US- ROK alliance and, indeed, ending the missile limitations and movement toward an OPCOM shift both point that way. Yet the logical conclusion \u2500 remove US ground troops in but maintain the US nuclear umbrella over South Korea \u2500 never occurred. It should also have respected South Korea\u2019s desire not to be made publicly to choose between the US and China. Enhancing South Korea\u2019s military clout and independence serves US aims without need for hanging an anti-China placard around Seoul\u2019s neck. Moreover, Washington\u2019s pointing South Korea at China increases Beijing\u2019s incentive to answer by enabling North Korean nuclear-weapons brinksmanship as a decoupling agent against US alliance relationships throughout the region. US deterrence posture in the Indo-Pacific would benefit from segregating the insoluble mess of Korea from the rest of the region, and building up its regional politico-military footprint elsewhere. Maintaining the US-ROK alliance status quo with mere incremental adjustments harms the prospect. Japanese officials grasp this logic but chafe at the unstable transition it implies. The Biden administration should therefore partner with Tokyo toward a more flexible and robust regional security posture. Had this been thought through five months ago, that effort could have begun on 16 April when Prime Minister Suga was in Washington."

    "title": "Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict: A Religious Strife?",
    "author(s)": "By Mohamed Bin Ali and Chew Si Xing Theresa",
    "date": "No. 183 \u2013 22 October 2020",
    "content": "SINCE THE conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan intensified on 27 September 2020, hundreds of soldiers and civilians have died and thousands of people displaced in the concentrated exchange of firepower. From the beginning of open armed hostility in 1988, the fighting has been portrayed, particularly by the Western media, as a \u201creligious war\u201d between Christian Armenians and Muslim Azerbaijanis. Such a characterisation is imprecise and is disputed. A deeper examination of this strife clearly reveals that politics rather than religion is the primary cause. Following decades of political disputes, there is strong mutual distrust and insecurity. In fact, the absence of religious themes has also been persistently maintained by the leaders of both sides in the conflict. How It Started The bloodshed in Nagorno-Karabakh has been described as an ethnic and territorial conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, two neighbouring states in the South Caucasus region between the Black Sea and Caspian Sea. This region has been described by scholars as the frontier of Europe, Russia, Turkey and Iran. It consists of various traditional homelands inhabited by populations belonging to different ethnic, religious and tribal backgrounds. For example, the original territory of Nagorno- Karabakh was an autonomous area with a Christian Armenian majority, within Soviet Azerbaijan, a predominantly Muslim republic in the then Soviet Union. Previously, the Soviet Union was in complete control. It kept irredentist tendencies and claims for ethnic autonomy in check. With a crumbling Soviet Union, war erupted over Nagorno-Karabakh in 1988. Fighting continued till 1994 when a ceasefire was declared. By then, the Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh (aided by Armenia) had also captured surrounding highlands belonging to Azerbaijan and physically connected Nagorno- Karabakh to Armenia. They proclaimed the establishment of the Republic of Artsakh which survived till today even though it is only recognised by Armenia and almost totally ignored by the international community. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) set up the Minsk Group to seek a peaceful resolution. This is co-chaired by France, Russia and the United States, and participated by Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Finland, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden and Turkey. Since 1992, the Minsk Group is the main forum for negotiations on Nagorno-Karabakh\u2019s future political status. These talks have so far not borne any fruit. Religious Conflict? The lack of peace between Azerbaijan and Armenia has often been described in the media as a \u201creligious conflict\u201d. This convenient portrayal is due to the fact that Azerbaijanis are mainly Muslim whereas Armenians are Christians. Undoubtedly, religion is one of the causes fuelling distrust between both parties. Armenian priests had led anti-Azerbaijani protests in the Armenian capital of Yerevan while echoing demands by Armenians that Nagorno-Karabakh be integrated with Armenia. On the other hand, the Grand Mufti of the Caucasus, Allahshukur Hummat Pashazadeh (based in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan), countered with a strong attack on \u201cthe enemies of Islam\u201d and called for mobilisation of the faithful with Islamic banners and flags during protests. However, the viewpoint that the conflict is religiously motivated in its entirety is inaccurate. In general, the populations of the Muslim republics of the former Soviet Union have remained indifferent. Distinguished Muslim figures like the late Chingiz Aitmatov (from Kyrgyzstan) and the late Rasul Gamzatov (from Russia) had officially denounced the atrocities committed during the fighting as violence committed by individuals in the name of their faith. Likewise, the leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia have come to an agreement that the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh is, in its essence, not caused by religion per se. What is Fuelling the War One needs to look into various primary factors for the prolonged armed clash between both parties. Roy Medvedev and Giuletto Chiesa argued in their book, Time of Change, that then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev could have assisted in the resolution of the conflict if he had been more flexible and far-sighted with constitutional changes for Russia and its former Soviet republics. The present conflict is also often the consequence of nationalism between Azerbaijanis and Armenians. Expressions of nationalism arise in many ways, such as the official commemoration by Armenia on 21 April annually for the victims of the alleged Armenian genocide during the Ottoman period; the Armenians identified the Azerbaijanis with the Turks even though the two are ethnically and traditionally distinct. The evocations of historical remembrance contributed to the constant bitterness of the regional crisis, hence the continued unwillingness by both parties to live in harmony. Causes of Violence Among States However, critics assert that much of the violence is driven by politically-vested interests of individual leaders who utilise the influence of secularism to gain public support. Janet Jakobsen, an expert on secular and religious violence, explains that modern secular states are the source of most of the world\u2019s violence today; hence secularism becomes a more important factor for violence compared to conflicts motivated by religion. Out of the 1700-odd recorded historical conflicts, only 123 or seven per cent had religion as their primary cause. This means that other factors are much more prominent as drivers of violent conflicts, with politics the primary one. Perpetuating the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh is not religion but the political interventions of external players. The involvement of foreign actors has prolonged the conflict as a means to assert economic and political gains in the region. By and large, the international media have played a big role in amplifying conflicts that are fuelled by religious reasons and seemingly diluting the seriousness of acts of violence perpetrated by secular states or other motivators. This leads to the conflation of \u201cviolence\u201d and \u201creligion\u201d. As religious violence expert Mark Juergensmeyer describes, this conflation is \u201cquite misleading\u201d. Indeed, it would be na\u00efve to conclude that all conflicts that involve different religious communities boil down solely to religious differences. It would be useful to identify the political players and those with vested interests in a specific conflict so as to gain a more holistic picture of the origins and propagation of the violence. This might be helpful in the search for conflict resolution or conflict management."

    "title": "Beyond COVID-19: Global Priorities Against Future Contagion",
    "author(s)": "By Jose Montesclaros",
    "date": "No. 030 \u2013 20 February 2020",
    "content": "IN A twist of fate, even as China battles with COVID-19, it has also seen the re- emergence of another disease, the bird flu epidemic also known as H5N1, with more than 17,000 chickens culled as of the beginning of February. Yet, this sequence of events may only be the \u2018tip of the iceberg\u2019, if one considers the findings of the Economist Intelligence Unit\u2019s (EIU) assessment of global health capacities, released five months ago. For instance, India, the world\u2019s second most populous country, had battled with the very same diseases although at a smaller scale, in recent weeks. Ill-prepared World In October 2019, the EIU Global Health Security Index had indicated that \u201c(no) single country in the world is fully prepared to handle an epidemic or pandemic\u201d. Granted, a 100% preparedness level may be hard to achieve. What is surprising, however, is how far countries are from the ideal state: the global average score is 40 out of 100, and even among the richest, high-income countries, the average score is 51.9. Worse still, this comes 15 years since the World Health Organisation (WHO) released its International Health Regulations in 2005, one of the references for the EIU\u2019s index. It recommended \u201cstrengthen(ing) national disease surveillance, prevention, control and response systems\u2026 (and) public health security in travel and transport\u201d. No one can say that the global community had not been forewarned. As early as March 2019, scholars from the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the Chinese Academy of Sciences had already published, presciently. They warned: \u201cIt is highly likely that future SARS- or MERS-like coronavirus outbreaks will originate from bats, and there is an increased probability that this will occur in China.\u201d Overwhelming and Intractable What those Wuhan scholars did not anticipate then though, was that while COVID-19 would not be nearly as deadly as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), it would instead be many times more contagious, closer in fact to the swine influenza, H1N1. The trait of being highly contagious but less (yet still) lethal, has been interpreted previously as the virus\u2019 own evolutionary mechanism to adapt and raise its own probability of survival. Indeed, if COVID-19 had killed off its first victims immediately, then after migrating from animals to man, it would have been less likely to \u2018travel\u2019 abroad too, and situate itself in over 29 countries and a cruise ship, \u201cDiamond Princess\u201d. We do not yet know how its lethal properties may worsen in the long run, as there are still multiple pending cases. This trend of evolution of viruses is making disease diagnosis more time-consuming, almost impossible for any single country, with the global community paying the higher costs of delays in findings. For instance, it took three weeks to confirm COVID-19\u2019s human-to-human transmission (21st January), since the time when the Chinese government reported its \u2018mystery pneumonia-like disease\u2019 (31 December 2019). The exponential spread of the virus within China (with spill-overs abroad), could have been significantly slowed had earlier action been taken. Yet, one cannot blame China, as its investment in infectious disease testing and monitoring far outstrips other countries, at US$1.94 billion, approximately triple that of the next biggest investor, Japan ($640 million), as reflected in the EIU\u2019s recent web briefing on COVID-19. Other countries today are thus more likely than not to have been caught off guard had they faced the same plight. In spite of these, China still saw a preponderance of \u2018false- negatives\u2019 such that its testing accuracy was only at 30-50%. Moreover, it took three days to generate tests results in Beijing, and only seven hospitals were equipped with some genome sequencing capacity for virus diagnosis, the EIU shared. Keeping Watch: Some Lessons WHO data shows that COVID-19\u2019s spread is slowing, having reached the highest number of daily new, lab-confirmed cases (approx. 4,000) on 5 February 2020; by 16 February this number had decreased to close to 1,000. Nonetheless, three key lessons can be gleaned from this experience thus far, if countries are to avoid the same plight. First, early research efforts are needed in preparing for future disease outbreaks, long before wartime conditions occur; in fact, doing so can shift global action from \u2018fire-fighting\u2019 to prevention. Global collaboration, seen today, should have begun with this, rather than in responding to the virus after it became an international phenomenon. Second, inputs from the academic and scientific community need to be given more weight. It is one thing to have faced COVID-19, but it is quite something else to have faced it even after warnings had been given in the previous first quarter in 2019. Third, as the types of novel forms of diseases have virtually multiplied over time, with each branch of the organism giving birth to sub-branches of different levels of contagiousness and lethality, potentially hitting multiple countries at the same time, it is imperative that an equally vigilant and networked approach is taken by the international community. Going Forward: Three Lenses A networked approach to preparing for novel diseases in future would be akin to holding three types of lenses at the same time: wide-lenses to see the full range of diseases as they occur; a microscope to investigate each one of them; and binoculars to foresee how these viruses are transforming far into the future. This is embodied in the Global (genome) Microbial Identifier (GMI) initiative advocated by scientists in 2011. The GMI is a \u201cglobal system to aggregate, share, mine and translate genomic data for microorganisms in real-time\u201d. This could provide \u2018wide- lenses\u2019 through real-time information sharing among scientists, governments and the private sector. For instance, the EIU shared involvement by Singapore\u2019s own Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) in developing new diagnostic tests for COVID- 19; China Mobile in tracking and minimising spread; Alibaba in mitigation; and Glaxosmithkline in designing treatments and vaccines, among others. It also gives \u2018binoculars\u2019, through synergistic research on the rapid evolution of pathogenic micro- organisms. However, it requires capacitating states with super \u2018microscopes\u2019, using whole- genome sequencing (WGS) or next generation genome sequencing (NGS) tools, as a previous RSIS report recommended. These are magnitudes more comprehensive than existing tests known as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests mentioned in the EIU\u2019s website. They require training and sufficient lead time to institutionalise. If anything, this is the type of early action needed today in facing potential contagions of tomorrow."

    "title": "Global Health Security: COVID-19 and Its Impacts Small States and Pandemic: The UAE Approach",
    "author(s)": "By Deep K Datta Ray",
    "date": "No. 152 \u2013 4 August 2020",
    "content": "THE FIRST COVID-19 case in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was a visitor from China\u2019s Wuhan City in late January 2020. As infections spiked, the government responded with more intensive testing, contact-tracing, and lockdown. Preparations are now underway for the post-COVID-19 normal. The avowed aim of the UAE government is \u201cto facilitate recovery faster than any other country\u201d. Testifying to this determination, the UAE successfully launched the Arab world\u2019s first Mars mission on 19 July 2020. The space project is led by a woman and demonstrated the UAE ambition to craft a more equal society spearheading technological innovation. Challenges, however, remain as the UAE has recorded over 340 fatalities from COVID-19. Infections are rising despite one of the best testing regimes in the world. Many foreign workers have left or are leaving. Still, the pandemic has also created opportunities for the leadership to do things differently. Reorganising for the New Normal The UAE\u2019s ministerial consultations resolved the new normal requires a rejig of organisation. That led to a bold restructure of ministerial responsibility, announced on 5 July 2020. For example, the new Ministry of Economy has three ministerial appointees handling economy, business and SMEs, and foreign trade respectively. Sharing of ministerial portfolios is also evident in the other ministries. The new Ministry of Community Development has absorbed the innovative Ministry of Happiness, first established in 2016. Food security has become the responsibility of both the Minister of Food and Water Security as well as the Minister of Environment. There are two new ministries, for Industry and Advanced Technology, and Energy and Infrastructure, but they continue the longstanding aim of digitalising manufacturing and services. A cyber security chief was also named. The sovereign wealth fund of the UAE will now also manage utilities, public transport, and property development. Half of all government service centres will eventually close down as digital services are coming on-line in the next two years. Overall, the ministers are given one year to deliver as their performance will be reviewed by the top rulers of the UAE after 12 months. New Threats, Established Plans New policies to offset COVID-19\u2019s costs have been implemented but a raft of earlier strategies persist, all of which is being implemented by the newly reorganised ministries. It is to be seen if this innovative mix of old and new will be successful in managing the pandemic\u2019s multifarious threats and bolster preparations across diverse sectors, for the new normal. The new policies include US$70 billion for loan relief to curb rising inequality and indebtedness. The high cost of utilities and tourism projects has been curtailed or reduced. Nevertheless, the mainstay of pandemic management are strategies dating back to at least 2015 on Innovation, Blockchain, and Artificial Intelligence. Intending to digitalise the UAE, these strategies have engendered an anti-fraud campaign and the National Computer Emergency Response Team to counter post-pandemic cyber criminality. Pre-pandemic policies also account for the Dubai Paperless Strategy which drove some digitalisation prior to the onslaught of COVID-19. Oyoon, the existing surveillance system was, however, redeployed for contact tracing. Existing, and long delayed, plans for an energy-diverse future continue. From Nuclear Power to Food Security The Barakah nuclear power plant enjoys IAEA approvals and having been successfully fuelled during the pandemic has now been started up. However, calls for a regional nuclear framework have fallen flat. Divergences between supply chains and technology are being negotiated to an extent. An aircraft parts manufacturer switched to making masks. Various UAE manufacturers intend to continue as before but they expect serious labour constraints going forward. The wide-body long-range aircraft of the Emirates fleet has been rendered obsolete by the pandemic and there is competition from neighbouring airlines ready for lower passenger loads flying shorter distances. Existing environmental policies have been enhanced by the pandemic, which has led to the speeding up of land restoration and clean architecture projects. COVID-19 has also renewed food security policies which have had some notable successes. The sustainability of persisting with growing rice in a desert with \u201cextremely high water stress\u201d however remains to be seen. New Friendships, Rising Tensions, Old Conflicts COVID-19 has been innovatively harnessed to renewing friendships, but these may be swamped by what the UAE\u2019s foreign minister calls a \u201chostile confrontation\u201d between the US and China. Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines responded warmly to medical aid from the UAE, which also assisted European, African and South American nations. Aid diplomacy is already realising returns. China received aid but now supports the UAE materially, with research, and is collaborating on a vaccine with considerable commercial potential. Participation in China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) valued at over US$3.4 billion, should not be politicised, said a top UAE official in May 2020. Weeks later a senior US official \u201chighlight(ed) the costs\u201d of America\u2019s partners engaging China. The UAE foreign minister has reiterated that his country\u2019s most significant partnership remains with the US. Yet, China is the UAE\u2019s second largest importer, and business-to-business transactions, including technology companies are expanding. China\u2019s strengthening relations with Iran will also present complications as the UAE, especially Dubai, has extensive trade and social links with neighbouring Iran which is under the \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d sanctions regime imposed by the US. Astute Diplomacy and Savvy Leadership Despite militarily withdrawing from Yemen, the UAE remains influential while the conflict lingers. Yemeni retaliation against UAE assets with drone and missile strikes continue to pose a significant challenge. The conflict in Libya between forces backed by, amongst others, the UAE, seems to be escalating. The blockade of Qatar is set to become a much greater distraction, as the protagonists are taking the case to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). Complicating plans for the new normal is the apparent differences in approach among the seven member emirates comprising the UAE to tackle the pandemic. Abu Dhabi, for instance, sealed itself off, but Dubai remained relatively ready to re-engage the world. For the new cabinet and policies to succeed, leadership will be critical. As a small state in an unstable region, the UAE has managed its vulnerabilities well through its astute diplomacy and savvy worldly leaders. The COVID-19 crisis has disrupted the status quo severely and has thrown up new uncertainties which undermine the UAE economy and society. In response, leadership guile is navigating the long road back to the familiar on the one hand, and through the transforming order on the other. The key to success is unity of purpose and cohesion of citizenry in the UAE."

While acknowledging the sacrifices of the people, he pointed out that \u201cunfortunately, the epidemic has not yet completely come to an end\u201d. Indeed, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), more than 62,000 deaths have resulted from the virus with almost three-and-a-half million cases, the world\u2019s fourth highest. Economy More Positive; Power Consolidation Putin however might be able to take some comfort from encouraging news on the state of the economy. According to the World Bank, Russia\u2019s gross domestic product was expected to shrink by four per cent in 2020; earlier forecasts had estimated contraction between 5.5% and 7%. Growth in 2021 is estimated at 2.6%. Further growth in the economy and the raising of living standards is being placed on the successful implementation of a US$400 billion programme of National Projects by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin. Many analysts see PM Mishustin as a possible successor to Putin. Consolidation of Power With an eye on the future, Putin initiated a package of constitutional amendments that theoretically allow him to run for re-election in 2024 and 2030; were he to emerge victorious in those election years, he could remain in power till 2036; these changes were approved by a referendum in July 2020. As part of the package, a law granting former presidents and their family members immunity from prosecution came into force on 2 January 2021. The law was approved by the State Duma and the Federation Council (Upper House) and signed by Putin in December 2020. An ex-president\u2019s immunity may be revoked only if the State Duma charges him with high treason or serious crimes. However, only if those charges are confirmed by the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court, will the Federation Council vote on whether or not to strip the ex-president of immunity, within three months. If no decision is reached within three months, the charges must be withdrawn. Nevertheless, it is still too early for Putin to rest on his laurels. His popularity ratings reportedly fell from 68% to 65% in November 2020, according to the independent pollster, the Levada Centre. When compared to the ratings of 53% in April 2020, that is an improvement. However, Putin, like most leaders, must be keen on securing and retaining as high a level of popular support as possible. Parliamentary Elections The State Duma elections, scheduled for September 2021, are therefore important to Putin\u2019s political future. Long dominated by the pro-government and pro-Putin United Russia (UR) (with its 238 seats in the 450-seat body), UR faces loyal opposition from the Communist Party, the Liberal Democratic Party and Just Russia Party. However, in the face of growing socio-economic discontent, UR cannot assume maintaining its continued parliamentary dominance will be plain sailing. According to prominent Russian economist, Vladislav Inozemtsev, Russians\u2019 real incomes today are 14.3% lower than they were in 2013. It might not be a pure coincidence that in the spring of 2020, the Russian Justice Ministry registered four new political parties. They might contest the seats in the State Duma elections and in the process, secure two to three per cent of the vote from the current parliamentary opposition, thus splintering protest votes, according to Kommersant, a Russian business daily. Another recent development is the institution of charges of large-scale fraud against Alexei Navalny; he was poisoned in August last year and sent to Germany for treatment. (The European Union and the United Kingdom have alleged that the Russian state was involved in his poisoning and have introduced sanctions against a number of high-level Russian officials; Moscow has rejected the West\u2019s allegations and introduced counter-sanctions as well). Some observers assume that this action is meant to politically neutralise Navalny, who has been critical of the Russian establishment for many years, and is becoming a prominent figure in the non-systemic viz. non-parliamentary opposition. The outcome of the State Duma elections would be an indicator of the electorate\u2019s political mood as it will be the last major political event before the end of President Putin\u2019s current term in 2024. At this stage, however, there is no real danger of UR losing its parliamentary dominance in September, as long as Putin remains overall popular and there is no other viable alternative to UR. Foreign Policy Challenges The US and the West: Putin would not be inclined to devote much energy and attention to relations with the West/US, given the prevailing mood against Russia. However, much will depend on how the Biden administration handles Moscow\u2019s diplomatic moves vis-\u00e0-vis the US/West, and on issues like the renewal of the New START Treaty on arms control, the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, nuclear proliferation, cyber governance, and the Middle East (especially Iran and the JCPOA \u2500 the Iran nuclear deal). China: While bilateral trade has dropped, China remains Russia\u2019s largest trade partner. On the political front, Putin is likely to visit China in 2021, should the pandemic situation allow, according to Andrei Denisov, the Russian Ambassador to China. If the visit does take place, it would reflect Russia\u2019s increased confidence in China\u2019s ability to tackle the pandemic and a signal of their growing relationship. Earlier in October 2020, Putin was quoted as saying there was no need for a Russia-China military alliance, but the possibility should not be ruled out in the future. Turkey: Turkey\u2019s support of Azerbaijan helped secure victory over Armenia in their conflict last year over Nagorno-Karabakh, and its influence in the region has consequently increased. While Russia was instrumental in arranging a ceasefire and ending hostilities and its peacekeepers in the conflict zone act as a check on Turkey\u2019s position, it must still manage Turkey\u2019s growing role in that former Soviet space. Russia and Turkey already compete for influence in Syria and Libya where both parties support opposing sides in the conflicts there. Iran: Russia and Iran maintain military forces in Syria and also compete for influence there. However, Iran\u2019s support of Syria and reportedly of units of Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah has alarmed Israel which view them as a threat. Russia maintains strong links with Israel and would not be keen on seeing a conflict emerge from Syrian soil between Iranian forces and Israel. Moreover, Russia cannot be keen on seeing Syria falling under Iran\u2019s growing influence. This is another challenge for Russian foreign policy in 2021 and beyond. Less Active Foreign Policy in 2021? In the face of the increasing pressure from domestic challenges, Putin will therefore have less inclination to conduct a vigorous foreign policy in 2021. That does not mean, nevertheless, that Russia would forego any attempt to protect and promote its interests, particularly in the former Soviet space, which are crucial to its security."

    "title": "WTO in Limbo: Urgent Need for New Director-General",
    "author(s)": "By Kaewkamol Pitakdumrongkit",
    "date": "No. 203 \u2013 26 November 2020",
    "content": "2020 IS not a good year for the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The institution is struggling to remain important and relevant in global trade governance. Concerning dispute settlement, the Appellate Body has ceased to function since December 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the postponement of the bi-annual Ministerial Conference which could have provided an opportunity for the members to alleviate their tensions and conflicts. Moreover, the rise of trade megadeals namely the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) tempts some observers to believe that trading blocs will eclipse WTO and become new key players advancing global trade. Enter WTO-Plus Blocs: New WTO Chief Needed Entering into force on 30 December 2018, CPTPP is an agreement among 11 parties representing 13.5 per cent of the world\u2019s goods trade. It is dubbed a \u201cWTO-Plus\u201d deal because some rules governing services trade and labour and environmental standards are more advanced than those of the WTO\u2019s. RCEP, which was signed by 15 countries on 15 November 2020, is the world\u2019s biggest trading bloc to date. While critics contend that the pact still awaits ratification from the signatories before being activated, the fact that RCEP covers about 30 per cent of the global GDP and 30 per cent of the world\u2019s population signifies its potential to shape the future landscape of international commerce. Furthermore, the stepping down of the director-general (DG) Roberto Azev\u00eado added another blow to WTO. Such move has made the organisation leaderless. Several nations see a need to elect the next chief soon. For instance, the Global Governance Group (3G) \u2013 an informal grouping of 30 nations convened by Singapore \u2013 released a statement urging all WTO parties \u201cto work together to expeditiously complete the selection and appointment of a new WTO director-general in accordance with the agreed rules and procedures\u201d. Why is a new DG needed? The main reason is that WTO needs a chief to help facilitate trade discussions and negotiations. Hence, the DG\u2019s influence largely emerges from the DG\u2019s soft skills. For instance, his ability to leverage on the networks of experts, businesses, and officials as well as ability to persuade conflicting parties to find a common ground can make or break the negotiation. Also, the chief may have access to certain knowledge such as members\u2019 interests. It can use the information to help members reconcile their different preferences and arrive at an agreed outcome. Additionally, presiding over some major gatherings, the DG can control the meeting\u2019s pace, the framing of issues, and the structure of the debates over certain matters. These elements can also determine whether the talks would ultimately succeed or fail. Challenges Facing Next DG Whoever becomes the next chief will have to use the above skills to tackle the following burning issues: In the areas of trade negotiation and liberalisation, the DG should convince the members to rely on certain FTAs as a template for crafting WTO\u2019s rules. History teaches us that such arrangements can be beneficial to global trade governance. For example, some terms of the North America Free Trade Agreement (now renamed as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement) were later adopted at the WTO and hence shaped the WTO\u2019s rules concerning investment, trade in services, and intellectual property rights. Regarding dispute settlement, the chief should urge the members to adopt the Walker Principles aimed at salvaging the appeal process by directly addressing the US\u2019 concerns. For example, the Principles ensure that facts are not subject to appeals, the Appellate Body makes the verdict within 90 days, and the entity\u2019s decision does not add to the members obligations and strip away their rights as provided by WTO. As far as transparency is concerned, the new DG should play an active role in collaborating with other international organisations especially the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) to come up with an agreed definition of a \u201cdeveloping nation\u201d. Doing so would help address the contentious issue of special and differential treatment (SDT) as some members intentionally self-select their developing country status to take advantage of SDT. The definition will improve transparency, enabling WTO to better monitor member\u2019s compliance and detect non-compliers. Now for Biden\u2019s Move At the time of writing, Singapore, as the 3G\u2019s convener, had been invited to attend the virtual G-20 Summit on 22-23 November which was hosted by Saudi Arabia. Free trade supporters were hoping that the world\u2019s leaders would use this Summit as a venue to convince one another to speed up the selection process. Yet, the world may have to wait until US president-elect Joe Biden is sworn into office in January 2021. As the new American administration is speculated to be more willing to pursue multilateralism and cooperate with partners and allies, the DG selection will likely be finalised not long after the US government is installed. In sum, the WTO members should finish selecting a new DG very soon as many burning issues remain to be tackled. As the world organisation is purposed to advance global trade governance, it cannot afford to be in limbo for long."

    "title": "Coming End of Merkel's Era: Whither Future European Leadership?",
    "author(s)": "By Frederick Kliem",
    "date": "No. 028 \u2013 18 February 2020",
    "content": "IN THE small German State of Th\u00fcringen, a local election recently shook the foundations of Germany\u2019s political landscape and possibly put an end to the Angela Merkel era. The little-known leader of the local FDP, Thomas Kemmerich, was elected Ministerpr\u00e4sident, or \u201cMinister-President\u201d (head of state-government in Germany\u2019s federalist system). The shocking result was brought about by an unofficial quasi- alliance of the centrist parties FDP and CDU with the far-right AfD \u2500 hitherto something unthinkable. Almost immediately, the Th\u00fcringen ballot caused nation-wide uproar. FDP and CDU faced the most furious of criticisms from across the country; Kemmerich was forced to resign, closely followed by no one less than the federal-CDU leader and defence minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the handpicked successor of Chancellor Merkel. Faustian Pact & Its Consequences Merkel herself stretched her authority beyond the acceptable by demanding the resignation of a duly elected Ministerpr\u00e4sident. De jure, the Th\u00fcringen election was democratically sound. As extreme as AfD may be, it is a duly elected party and its parliamentarians free to support any candidate they choose. The de facto taboo lies in the unprecedented election of a government through AfD votes and with the acquiescence of the centrist parties, in violation of the nation-wide consensus to stigmatise the far-right. Worse still, the Th\u00fcringen AfD is the most extreme of all AfD chapters, and their leader, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, espouses strong elements of fascism and racism. Kramp-Karrenbauer failed to discipline the Th\u00fcringen chapter to honour the official CDU consensus against cooperating with any extreme party. Afterwards, she called for new state-elections but lacked the power to enforce such demands. Ultimately, the local refusal to follow federal consensus has serious consequences. Firstly, this farce demonstrated how the rise of small and extremist parties increasingly destabilises Germany\u2019s political system, fragments parliaments and makes the anti- extremist consensus of the established big-tent parties increasingly difficult to sustain. Secondly, it exposed how deeply factionalised Merkel\u2019s CDU is. While some support the liberal path Merkel has taken, others are concerned about what they see as a departure from traditional conservative values. Some even openly toy with the idea of cooperating with the AfD, or at least adopting some of their public policy positions. And thirdly, while Merkel was already on her way out of the German Chancellery, the AfD may just have managed to expedite this process. This would not only be a huge win for the AfD who has always campaigned to achieve Merkel\u2019s ouster. It may also end the hope that for the first time in German history a Chancellor leaves on her own terms and in an orderly fashion. End of Angela Merkel Angela Merkel has never been the same since Europe\u2019s refugee crisis in 2015, which many in Germany and Europe think she badly mishandled. Despite still being popular among Germans, Merkel is the number one target of the intensifying ideological trench-warfare within both country and party. That Merkel was forced to put her foot down in Th\u00fcringen and weigh-in from an overseas trip symbolised just how badly she managed her own power transition. Chancellor Merkel intends to remain in office until the 2021 elections but transferred CDU party leadership to her chosen heir Kramp-Karrenbauer in 2018. This broke with Merkel\u2019s own preference of concentrating leadership of government and party in one person. This made it impossible for Kramp-Karrenbauer to consolidate a power base in the party and gain the authority necessary to maintain party discipline. Power Jostling Begins Several high-ranking CDU politicians will now position themselves to succeed Kramp- Karrenbauer. However, given her experience, it is unlikely that her successor would accept party leadership while Merkel remains Chancellor. At the same time, Merkel herself has given no sign of contemplating resignation, and the CDU coalition partner, SPD, suggested that they will not continue the coalition under any other CDU Chancellor. In other words, either the CDU exhausts itself in a prolonged leadership crisis, or, more likely, the government collapses, precipitating early general elections and the end of the Merkel-era. The Th\u00fcringen debacle already is a huge victory for H\u00f6cke and the AfD. A far-right populist leader of a small parliamentary group in a small state has brought about the ultimate embarrassment for the establishment. They have mocked the Th\u00fcringen parliament, the FDP and the CDU. H\u00f6cke already caused the fall of the CDU leader, and may indirectly trigger Merkel\u2019s political demise, too. The AfD have triggered a national crisis, which will probably further boost their popularity. A European Leadership Crisis? Merkel was widely considered the most powerful actor in Europe and the shining light of EU politics. The longest serving head of government in the EU has proven time and again her steady hand and acquired a reputation for being Europe\u2019s undisputed authority. But Germany has thus far failed to confront the consequences of geopolitical change. There are powerful voices in Germany urging government and country to think strategically, assume global responsibility and leadership, and prepare Germans for the costs of geopolitical change. However, neither the German population nor a lame- duck government is willing or able to heed this advice. Later this year Germany will duly assume the rotating EU Presidency; an important function in the EU that demands German leadership. Supposedly with this in mind, Merkel wants to ride out this crisis. However, with Merkel\u2019s failure to secure an orderly transition, Germany will be looking inwards for some time to come, whether she sits out her term or not. Regardless of how events in Germany unfold, European leadership will be in the hands of Emmanuel Macron. Macron does not have robust domestic support, either, but the French president is full of strategic vision for Europe. And with the end of Merkel, Europe will need French leadership more than ever."

    "title": "Lethal Autonomous Weapons: No Law for LAWS?",
    "author(s)": "By Kelvin Wong",
    "date": "No. 122 \u2013 12 August 2021",
    "content": "ON 2 AUGUST 2021, the international Human Rights Watch (HRW) launched a renewed effort to urge governments to negotiate a treaty that sets binding regulations \u2013 or even an outright ban \u2013 on the use of lethal autonomous weapons (LAWS). The NGO released a 17-page report, entitled \u201cAreas of Alignment: Common Visions for a Killer Robots Treaty\u201d. It describes how dozens of countries have stated their objections to \u201cdelegating life-and-death decisions to machines\u201d during the Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW) last held in September 2020. The report also came a day before representatives from 50 countries were expected to consider the matter in Geneva following the months-long hiatus. Military Utility of LAWS Many military systems and weapons in use today are already semi-autonomous in nature because they rely on autonomy for certain parts of their system; but they retain a physical or communications link to a human operator who will make the ultimate decision on any action. One example would be integrated air defence systems that can automatically identify, track, and calculate optimal responses to multiple incoming threats. Another example: unmanned vehicles that are able to self-navigate and execute a range of actions using pre-determined directives set by an operator. In both instances, the command to employ lethal force \u2013 such as launching a surface- to-air missile or an unmanned aircraft\u2019s onboard weapons \u2013 firmly remain under the sole province of human control. In contrast, autonomous weapon systems can identify, select and engage a target with lethal force without an operator\u2019s intervention, would independently respond to a dynamic environment, and determine the optimal course of action to achieve its pre- programmed goals. Advantages of LAWS As autonomous weapons do not require constant interaction with one or more human operators these systems would offer military forces several advantages. These include reduced cognitive load on personnel and much shorter sensor-to- shooter cycles, and even immunity to traditional countermeasures such as jamming. It could also mean that large numbers of these weapons can be deployed simultaneously; this is because human operators with their limited cognitive capacities are no longer needed to direct them. Indeed, notwithstanding the ongoing debate and growing alarm over LAWS, military forces across the world have demonstrated a growing interest in procuring unmanned aerial, ground, and maritime vehicles that are often highly automated and capable of carrying weapons. While these unmanned vehicles remain largely in human control, there are serious concerns that the line between present-day platforms and LAWS will become blurred over time as military forces continue to seek and field increasingly advanced systems. Moreover, the emerging breed of unmanned combat systems being developed to fight alongside or replace crewed platforms across the air, land, and maritime domains in future battlefields will necessarily feature high levels of autonomy not only to be able to operate in spectrum-contested environments but also to independently assess and react to fluid situations during battle. Paradigm Shift Into the Unknown? The proliferation of such weapon systems could result in a paradigm shift in the conduct of military operations. Some observers believe that LAWS present an opportunity to make combat more humane by reducing the number of civilian and military casualties on the battlefield. Others are concerned about unintended escalation and potential global instability, as well as the risks of having such potentially deadly weapons fall into the hands of non- state actors. Among the main concerns of international watchdogs and countries demanding tight control or a total ban on LAWS is that the use of such systems is incompatible with international humanitarian law. There are to be observed fundamental rules of distinction and proportionality; human qualities that serve as checks and balances; and compel most actors to apply force only in the most limited range of situations. Another pressing concern about the use of autonomous weapons is how little data or understanding that we currently possess about such systems. For example, the AI that underpin autonomous weapons must be trained, tested, and validated to ensure that they function as expected. But such efforts are presently carried out within controlled environments such as laboratories and are hardly representative of rapidly changing and often highly ambiguous real-world environments. Without such rigorous testing, the risk of unintended and disastrous results are very real possibilities. Moreover, while individual operators and military commanders can be held responsible for breaching international treaties such as the Geneva Conventions, it would be legally challenging and morally questionable to bring charges against such individuals for the unintended or unforeseeable actions of an autonomous weapon system. Most of these groups believe that an unambiguous and total ban on LAWS is necessary as opposed to current approaches that essentially centre on attempts to implement a set of guiding principles and best practices, or worse, non-binding political declarations. Banning LAWS: An Unlikely Prospect? According to HRW, there are presently 31 countries calling for a ban on LAWS: Algeria, Argentina, Austria, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Djibouti, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Ghana, Guatemala, the Holy See, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Namibia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, the State of Palestine, Uganda, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe. The outlier is China, which surprisingly called upon other governments in April 2018 \u201cto negotiate and conclude a succinct protocol to ban the use of fully autonomous weapons systems\u201d. China was the first permanent member of the UN Security Council and the 26th country to call for a ban on LAWS. However, it appears that Beijing\u2019s stated intent has little substance given that its military apparatus continues to engage in the development of such systems today. Despite a growing pool of international voices supporting this motion, it is clear that prospects for a legally binding instrument on LAWS remain dim for the foreseeable future for several reasons. First, CCW discussions on the matter have remained largely impotent thus far because of excessive consensus building that slows the process, often resulting in lowest- common-denominator decisions. Second, it is also clear that most countries supporting a ban on LAWS are typically unable to pursue indigenous development of these systems while countries that possess the financial and technical wherewithal to do otherwise remain opposed to such limitations. For instance, leading military powers such as Russia and the United States have consistently rejected proposals for a treaty, calling such moves \u201cpremature\u201d."

    "title": "China\u2019s Artificial Islands in South China Sea: Extended Forward Presence",
    "author(s)": "By Olli Pekka Suorsa",
    "date": "No. 042 \u2013 19 March 2020",
    "content": "MUCH HAS been written about China\u2019s artificial islands in the Spratlys, South China Sea. A lot of the debate has focused on the outposts\u2019 potential military value. The actual military potential in any near-peer military confrontation would prove more of a hindrance than an asset for Beijing. The United States military still holds more options to degrade or stop Chinese military operations from those outposts in a conflict. The real value those outposts bring to Beijing, however, is not in their potential wartime uses but in the value they offer right now, during peacetime. China has placed significant air and surface surveillance and intelligence gathering capabilities on all of its seven holdings in the Spratlys. The surveillance capability provided by these systems allow China to effectively monitor all air and sea traffic \u2014 civilian and military \u2014 entering or departing the South China Sea. This ability supports both Chinese civilian and military functions in the South China Sea. Sustained Presence Even more critically, China\u2019s Spratly outposts \u2014 in particular the three largest islets: the Fiery Cross Reef, Mischief Reef and Subi Reef \u2014 have seen frequent refuel and resupply visits from China Coast Guard (CCG) and sheltered other paramilitary forces vessels like the People\u2019s Armed Forces\u2019 Maritime Militia (PAFMM). The ability to refuel and resupply in the artificial island outposts in the Spratlys has greatly expanded both CCG and PAFFM reach and helped sustain prolonged presence in the disputed waters. The Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI) has mapped the movements of Chinese CCG and fishing trawlers broadcasting AIS (Automatic Identification System) signal. The gathered AIS data, tracking Chinese vessels, shows several CCG ships operating in the South China Sea making frequent supply-runs to and operating from the three largest artificial islands. The AMTI recorded several ships, likely based at Hainan, sustaining weeks- and months-long presence in the disputed waters, facilitated by intermittent resupply visits to the artificial islands in the Spratlys. Harassment of Other Claimants\u2019 Operations During the most recent period of heightened tensions, from May 2019 until January 2020, CCG ships harassed Malaysian and Vietnamese oil/gas exploration and survey activities, and extended operations to Philippines and Indonesian EEZs. In May, a CCG ship harassed Shell chartered drilling rig Sapura Esperanza, near the Luconia Shoal (Block SK 308), over the period of two weeks. Chinese ships have maintained frequent presence around the Luconia Breakers since 2013. Following a brief resupply visit in Hainan, the ship moved on to Vietnamese EEZ on 16 June 2019, causing tense standoff between Vietnamese and Chinese vessels lasting from mid-June till early July. This was the most intense standoff between the two claimants since the 2014 HYSY981 oil rig incident that unleashed anti-China protests in Vietnam. Another vessel, a Chinese survey ship, HD-8, crossed into Vietnamese EEZ a few weeks later, on 3 July 2019, to collect seismic data near Vanguard Bank (Block 06- 01), supported by three CCG vessels. Any Vietnam Coast Guard attempts to intercept the survey ship were met with CCG ships shooing the Vietnamese away. Significantly, the HD-8 was recorded to refuel and resupply at the Fiery Cross Reef at least once before returning to its survey station in Vietnam\u2019s EEZ. After finishing their missions there, several CCG ships, having called port at the artificial islands, entered Indonesia\u2019s EEZ, at the North Natuna Sea, in January 2020. Upon departing Indonesia\u2019s waters, the vessels returned to the Fiery Cross Reef for resupply. Elsewhere, Mischief Reef has supported CCG activity toward the Scarborough Shoal, a maritime feature China took control over after a brief spat with the Philippines in 2012. The third of the \u2018big three\u2019\u2014 the Subi Reef \u2014 has received CCG vessels and maritime militia boats on their operations near the Philippines\u2019 Thitu Island, which lies just over 12 nautical miles from the Subi Reef outpost. China\u2019s Extended Forward Presence Previously, CCG ships would have had to make supply-runs to Hainan, some 550 nautical miles north from the Spratlys. The sheer distance limited ships\u2019 operational range and on-station time significantly. The new \u2018forward bases\u2019 in the Spratlys have thus greatly benefitted the CCG in extending endurance and reach. Conducting refuel and resupply runs to the Fiery Cross Reef, Mischief Reef and Subi Reef has facilitated the CCG longer loitering times and help vessels reach further into"

    "title": "State of the World Economy Democracy & Digital Governance: Help or Hindrance?",
    "author(s)": "By Amalina Anuar",
    "date": "No. 070 \u2013 27 April 2021",
    "content": "IN A hyper-connected world rocked by the Sino-US competition in 5G formats and allegations of digital snooping by Chinese and US tech companies, the Biden administration seems to think that democracy and democratisation unto cyberspace is the solution. However, all is not so clear cut. For one, doubling down on the reinforcement of democracy at home and abroad avoids a reassessment of how and to what extent democracy in its current \u2014 usually Western \u2014 form is and is not fit for purpose in a digital age. Problematic Principles Whether in the United States, European Union (EU), or elsewhere, key data policy practices are modelled on democratic principles. Data sharing and mobility within or across borders often hinges upon mechanisms of transparency and the protection of privacy as an individual right. Entities seeking access to data are legally obligated to provide notice of what data is collected and how it is used to garner consent. Legal redress of violated data rights is generally contingent upon individuals proving harm or injury towards their persons. But these approaches may not afford adequate data-related social protection, which is key to enabling trust. First, the gold standard of consent shifts the responsibility of data protection onto individuals, despite mounting evidence that such deputisation is a tall order. It is doubtful that the average person can keep track of all data exchanged, consent meaningfully when faced with complex legal language, or fully comprehend the workings of algorithms, for instance, even where simpler explanations are available. This insufficiency of transparency or openness may be especially problematic where populations have only recently come online or have lower data literacy. Second, data rights are individual rights but groups are increasingly harmed in the digital political economy. Policies backed by big data and algorithms are applied to groups for security and development purposes, such as racially discriminatory predictive policing (or analysing data to identify potential criminal activity). However, even if an entire collective is affected, it is generally harder for individuals to seek remedy for collective harm because they must prove that all members of that group suffered actual injury. Global Digital Governance: Different Models The global digital economy may be increasingly split across different data governance models, with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) being most sensitive to digital protection. But leadership on these issues even across democracies can be flatfooted, if not lagging. The US still lacks a national privacy law and has ceded leadership in data policymaking, even if its companies are at the forefront of the digital revolution. This is to say nothing, moreover, of the anti-democratic global surveillance undertaken by the Five Eyes Intelligence Network and company. The EU, meanwhile, has attempted to finetune mechanisms of notice and consent, most recently via mandating fiduciary duties so data controllers act in an individual\u2019s best interests when handling their data. But when ill-defined and left in broad-brush terms, as in the case of last year\u2019s Digital Markets Act that seeks to govern online platforms, these can be broad concepts that leave wriggle room for abuse. Need for Inclusivity Data governance issues such as the aforementioned could be taken up within a close- knit circle of democratic allies, as the Biden administration\u2019s National Security Strategic Guidance seems to suggest. But it is questionable whether such discussions, though founded upon discourses such as transparency, should be held exclusively. Therein lies another shortcoming. Putting aside complications in sorting the world into democratic versus non-democratic classes, many countries are grappling with digital and technology regulation. While fundamental differences between data governance models exist, there are dimensions of convergence. China\u2019s 2020 draft privacy bill borrows noticeable elements from the GDPR. Consent too is a global best practice, and one that may not be future-proof in addition to providing inadequate data protection. Much consent is generated through screening texts, for instance, but this raises questions of operability in a world moving towards a screen-less Internet of Things. These are shared realities. Way Forward: Global Data Governance Body? There is thus space to establish an international institution dedicated to digital and data governance. Existing institutions like the World Trade Organisation, while dabbling in digital governance, ultimately touch upon specific disciplines such as e- commerce rather than broader rules on consent and rights underpinning the digital sphere. A new multilateral establishment would need the backing of economic heavyweights such as the US, China and the G20. However, it may be better served by highlighting leadership from more cyber-savvy small and middle powers such as Estonia and Singapore, rather than major powers per se. This would provide a forum for best practice sharing, though it will remain to be seen whether such multi-stakeholder talks will succour an appetite for tackling bigger obstacles to data sharing and accessibility. This includes the power asymmetries between state-society-market actors, which lie behind movements to contaminate the very data needed to harness technology effectively. Moreover, it could hold space for conversations on what the digital economy and data, as well as regulatory tools such as antitrust laws and data trusts, can and cannot do \u2014 and importantly, communicate that to the public. This would help manage expectations of what a gilded age of technology can and should reasonably deliver globally, thereby pre-empting disenchantment and trust deficits in governing institutions. For instance, antitrust suits, while on the upswing, may not fundamentally shift business models of data rent seeking even if it breaks up oligopolies. Urgency in Post-Pandemic World These conversations are more urgent in a post-pandemic world where a reliance on technology co-exists with various concerns over how it is used and to what end. There is, for instance, lingering angst over privacy, concentration of power in Big Tech, and the need to contextualise Western technology for non-Western contexts. An inclusive multilateral approach will not necessarily reverse all trends towards international regulatory divergence. Still, it could keep a channel of communication open for standard-setting cooperation amidst a sea of otherwise competitive and adversarial technology issues \u2014 something that a democracy-only approach cannot do. In the spirit of democracy, it would also show that Washington is listening to the majority of countries \u2014 allies included \u2014 who baulk at choosing sides and seek a less polarised world, even as they find themselves at odds with different systems of governance."

    "title": "US Afghan Withdrawal: Enter China and Taliban?",
    "author(s)": "By Loro Horta",
    "date": "No. 120 \u2013 10 August 2021",
    "content": "DURING THE US intervention in Afghanistan, China kept a low profile. Sharing a border with Afghanistan, Beijing has always watched closely developments across. Notwithstanding its low profile, China had not been passive. While avoiding involvement in Afghanistan\u2019s politics, Beijing had focussed instead on economic opportunities. As the US and NATO provided security, Chinese companies have been making inroads into the troubled country. As of 2020 China was the biggest foreign investor in Afghanistan, investing mainly in mining and infrastructure. In 2011 two Chinese state- owned companies signed an agreement with the Afghan government to invest US$3.5 billion in an iron ore mine near the capital Kabul. In the same year China\u2019s state-owned oil company, CNPC, began oil extraction in the Amu Darya basin, a $700 million investment. Afghanistan also has significant deposits of rare earth minerals. Rare Earths & Beijing\u2019s Strategic Concerns The country\u2019s rare earth minerals reserves are estimated at one million metric tonnes. Rare earth minerals are used in computers, smart, phones, digital cameras and other advanced electronic equipment. They are also vital for the military industry. China currently possesses the largest reserves of such minerals and has aggressively sought mining concessions throughout the world. With a China-friendly regime, Afghanistan could play an important role in China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative {BRI}. Afghanistan borders two important Chinese allies, Pakistan and Iran. Beijing hopes to connect these two countries via railroad through Afghanistan. An oil and gas pipeline from Iran passing through Afghanistan, Pakistan and into China has also been discussed. Such a pipeline would reduce China\u2019s dependence on maritime sea lanes currently dominated by the US navy, including the Straits of Malacca and Singapore. While China economic interests have grown in Afghanistan, Beijing\u2019s motivation is not profit. China\u2019s main interests in Afghanistan are of a strategic and political nature. With the American troop withdrawal from Afghanistan to be completed by 31 August this year, most observers are predicting the rapid collapse of the Afghan government. In the aftermath, the Taliban is expected to take control of most of the country. China fears that instability in Afghanistan could spill over the border to its restive province of Xinjiang where Beijing is facing Uighur separatists, an ethnic Turkic Muslim people. Many Uighurs were captured by the US military while fighting in Afghanistan among the ranks of Al Qaeda and IS. Chinese authorities fear that Al Qaeda and IS could infiltrate the Taliban and assist Uighur separatists. Therefore, China is determined to build close ties with the Taliban and assist in the consolidation of its power. Beijing\u2019s quiet diplomacy seems to be working. Security Considerations In early July the Taliban announced that it saw China as a friend and an important partner in the reconstruction of Afghanistan. The Taliban pledged not to allow Uighur militants to use its territory to target China. China seems to be securing its main objective: stability along its border and the containment of Uighur militants. Why would the Taliban, a movement whose goal is to create an Islamic republic in Afghanistan ruled by Sharia law, cooperate with a secular communist state? Afghanistan has been devastated by decades of war and it is among the poorest nations in the world. The Taliban will need significant assistance to rebuild the country. Western countries and financial institutions are unlikely to assist. China, with its massive reserves of capital and close proximity to Afghanistan, can play a supporting role in the survival of a future Taliban government. The country with the most influence over the Taliban is arguably Pakistan. Several US intelligence organisations and senior officials have for years linked Pakistan to the Taliban. Some claimed that without Islamabad\u2019s support, the Taliban could not have become as strong as they are today. Pakistan is said to have been providing money and training to the Taliban. More vital for the Taliban and its associates, Pakistan has provided sanctuary. Filling in the Vacuum Pakistan is China\u2019s closest and most reliable ally. Both sides describe their alliance as an \u201call weather relationship\u201d. China counts on its loyal ally to keep the Taliban friendly towards China. Some Western observers have suggested that China's engagement with a movement with a questionable human rights record is motivated by a desire to protect Beijing's strategic interests. The fact of the matter is that China and its ally Pakistan could contribute to stabilising Afghanistan and moderating the Taliban. Al Qaeda and IS in particular have gained ground in Afghanistan and are trying to infiltrate the Taliban. The Taliban are the strongest force in Afghanistan today and are quite likely to take control of the country in the near future. These are the facts on the ground. China has chosen to face them without any hypocritical moral sermons. After all President Trump did invite the Taliban to the White House. Ironically, if China fills the vacuum left by the US, it is to the benefit of all, including the US and its allies."

    "title": "Global Health Security: COVID-19 and Its Impact Impetus for SAARC Revival?",
    "author(s)": "By Nazia Hussain",
    "date": "No. 076 \u2013 24 April 2020",
    "content": "WHEN INDIAN Prime Minister Narendra Modi took to Twitter urging SAARC heads of states meet for a video conference to address the COVID-19 crisis, speculation was rife whether the moribund South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) was poised for a comeback. The impromptu virtual summit on 15 March 2020 was the first high-level meeting since India pulled out of the 2016 SAARC Summit that was to take place in Islamabad. India has been keeping SAARC at arm\u2019s length in the wake of the 2016 cross-border terrorist incidents at Uri and Pathankot as tensions heightened between New Delhi and Islamabad. PM Modi\u2019s latest initiative surprised many India watchers. Unprecedented Move Modi reached out to the eight-nation grouping \u2014 Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Pakistan \u2014 at a time when SAARC had been ticked off as defunct since its last Summit in 2014. Described as a \u201cslow boat to nowhere\u201d, SAARC is internally fraught being hostage to India-Pakistan rivalry. Moreover, changing geopolitical realities with Beijing\u2019s expanding footprints in the neighbourhood and beyond is shifting the traditional boundaries of a largely continental South Asia to a maritime one, rendering SAARC somewhat obsolete. New Delhi had instead turned its focus on sub-regional groupings such as the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), the Bangladesh-Bhutan-India-Nepal (BBIN) initiative, and the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) as alternatives to deliver on connectivity, development and counter-terrorism efforts. While these groupings are considered ideal platforms to enhance regional cooperation without any major rivalries amongst their members, some SAARC member states such as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal still hold on to the promise of SAARC as the older and bigger regional organisation. The virtual conference was attended by all SAARC heads of states, except for Pakistan which was represented by the Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health. The event was thus touted as the sign of a resurrected SAARC. SAARC Response to COVID-19 While the dormant SAARC could barely address its structural challenges, the grouping has performed surprisingly well in swift implementation of collective measures to tackle the pandemic. In fact, relatively successful and better equipped regional groupings such as the European Union and ASEAN have had muted response and is yet to deliver action on collectively tackling the COVID-19 pandemic. At the video-conference, PM Modi announced the creation of a COVID-19 Emergency Fund and pledged US$10 million; subsequently all SAARC member states voluntarily pitched in. India also proposed a shared electronic platform for all SAARC nations to help in training of emergency personnel, disease surveillance and joint research. Furthermore, existing mechanisms like the SAARC Disaster Management Centre (SDMC) and the SAARC Development Fund (SDF) has been activated for coordinated response. The SDMC has set up a COVID-19 website with daily updates of confirmed cases throughout South Asia and actions that each country is taking. Meanwhile, the SDF has allocated $5 million to soften the blow of financial losses and severe socio- economic impact from the pandemic. Leadership and political will is critical for substantial joint response and SAARC leaders proposed collective ways to combat COVID-19. Afghanistan suggested that SAARC adopt a shared telemedicine framework to provide health care to the remotest parts of the region. Maldives called for closer cooperation between countries\u2019 respective health emergency agencies and a long-term economic recovery plan for the region. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh emphasised the need for the deliberations to continue at the ministerial level as well as among health experts. Pakistan offered to hold a SAARC health ministers\u2019 video-conference and proposed establishing a working group of national authorities to exchange health information, data and coordination in real time. Revival of SAARC? While SAARC countries coming together for issue-based cooperation is significant to reigniting the regional bloc, it might be premature to herald the emergence of a SAARC 2.0. For starters, the inherent issue of Indo-Pak rivalry still simmers below the surface. The virtual summit did not see Pakistan\u2019s participation at the leaders-level and the country utilised the SAARC COVID-19 forum to raise the Kashmir issue. New Delhi and Islamabad also disagreed on how the emergency funds are to be managed. Pakistan pushed for the funds to be administered by the SAARC secretariat. India responded by saying that it was for each SAARC member state to decide on the timing, manner and implementation of their contributions. Pakistan then skipped a video conference of senior SAARC trade officials since the SAARC secretariat was not involved in organising it. These proceedings do not bode well for a possible resurrection of SAARC. The SAARC Charter requires unanimity in the decision-making process and unless the nature of the relationship between the South Asian neighbours changes, the best SAARC can expect is interim issue-based cooperation. Multipronged Regionalism If indeed SAARC makes a comeback as the regional grouping of choice in South Asia, it does not necessarily mean that the recently invigorated BIMSTEC will return to the back-burner. While inherent problems within SAARC remain, BIMSTEC has much higher coherence among member states. SAARC includes Pakistan and Afghanistan without which it is hard to imagine a South Asian neighbourhood. BIMSTEC not only caters to the wider concept of the \u2018Indo-Pacific\u2019, it also includes two ASEAN member states (Myanmar and Thailand) in its ranks, which broadens the scope of regional cooperation. Moreover, where SAARC has fallen behind providing regional connectivity, BIMSTEC strives to fill in \u2013 the BIMSTEC Connectivity Master Plan is a $50 billion project which would have 167 connectivity-related components linking India up to the east coast of Vietnam through extension of the Trilateral Highway involving India, Myanmar and Thailand. As Beijing extensively engages South and Southeast Asian countries through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), both in land and maritime domains, the strategic geography and regional architecture have been rapidly evolving. A multi-pronged approach to advancing South Asian regionalism could be the way forward with SAARC as well as sub-regional groupings such as BIMSTEC playing their respective roles rather than being portrayed as competing entities."

    "title": "Global Health Security: COVID-19 and Its Impact EU and ASEAN: In Common Disunity",
    "author(s)": "By Alan Chong and Frederick Kliem",
    "date": "No. 077 \u2013 27 April 2020",
    "content": "ON 16 APRIL 2020, The Guardian newspaper in the United Kingdom published a remarkable story that lauded Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s dispassionate, scientific explanation of how Germany could flatten the curve of COVID-19 infections if it continued to strictly enforce social distancing and lock down the economy. In the midst of rampant uncertainty about when normality could return to public life across the European Union and the lack of an EU anti-COVID-19 action plan, Merkel\u2019s message and presence received far warmer treatment outside her country than at home. She was not speaking as a prominent EU politician; it was plain and simple national leadership from the pedestal of one of the EU\u2019s largest and wealthiest members. ASEAN and EU Responses Compared In Southeast Asian and international media, ASEAN is seen as generally immaterial in the fight against COVID-19 despite its reputation of being in the driver\u2019s seat of regional cooperation and community-building processes. ASEAN\u2019s chair country for 2020, Vietnam, has been celebrated domestically and across Southeast Asia for its proactive measures to lock down early on any commune or district that contained a single COVID-19 infected resident. Contact tracing was widely deployed and the national guidance given to its population was to re-enact the spirit of resistance against a foreign invader. This securitisation legitimised collective sacrifices of consumer convenience, school closures and the shutdown of daily commuting in locked-down zones. Hanoi too imposed travel bans and mandatory 14-day quarantine of all foreign arrivals just like its ASEAN neighbours. By mid-April it boasted no more than 268 cases and no fatality while also declaring that all patients were steadily recovering. This prompted a number of commentators to argue that Hanoi could now enjoy diplomatic momentum to flesh out ASEAN\u2019s \u2018model\u2019 of pandemic containment. The problem is that, aside from a vaguely worded commitment by ASEAN leaders and their Plus Three counterparts from China, Japan and South Korea to set up a joint aid fund for supporting economically weaker ASEAN member states facing the pandemic, there remains no substantial region-wide plan to combat COVID-19. What then has hobbled the respective regional leaderships in the EU and ASEAN in tackling the deadly virus? Nations Going it Alone COVID-19 is turning into one of the greatest global challenges of our lifetime, and it is testing the international resolve to cooperate. Both China and the United States have hitherto failed to provide global leadership. While concerted global action is always difficult to achieve, it is the geographical regions where collective COVID-19 governance could have been expected most. And nowhere more so than in Europe and East Asia where the EU and ASEAN are generally regarded as the two most advanced regional organisations. Yet, the EU and ASEAN are struggling with nationalistic instincts and unilateral knee-jerk reactions. In both regions, integration is based on and accelerated by geographical proximity and human and economic connectivity. Ironically, as the spread of COVID-19 intensifies, it appears that these two acknowledged pillars of integration are fumbling with needed actions to deal with the crisis. Even where previously agreed measures for crisis management at the bureaucratic levels were activated, parochial considerations took precedence and any modicum of joint response was absent. Instead of cooperating to uphold intra-regional connectedness, many governments unilaterally abandoned achievements of regional integration as countries shut borders, broke supply chains and fought over medical supplies. In the nerve centre of the EU, the European Commission in Brussels did little to warrant its reputation for institutional cooperation and legalism. When some EU members went into full nationalist gear and curtailed the precious freedom of movement of goods and people, the much vaunted single market place and borderless Schengen area in Europe were de facto abandoned. When Italy asked its EU \u201cfriends\u201d for solidarity in the form of medical equipment as well as commonly guaranteed sovereign debt, other EU capitals decreed export bans on such goods, forsaking the EU single market, and issued a clear \u201cno\u201d to common Eurobonds. Like EU, ASEAN Faced Pandemic with Fear Likewise in Southeast Asia, the pandemic aroused public fear that played into the national security mindsets of elected and authoritarian leaders alike. The instant reaction was framed in terms of COVID-19 needing a domestic lock-down solution. Multilateral cooperation came to a standstill as borders were closed and travel restricted unilaterally. Despite being the most logical platform to manage a common transboundary challenge, the leaders of ASEAN and their Plus Three partners from China, Japan and South Korea came together for a teleconference only several months into the pandemic. Even then, some leaders continued to speak of the need to protect supply chains, and after reducing the numbers of fatalities, to create mutual health protocols for ensuring the safety of air passengers commuting between one another\u2019s cities. The average ASEAN citizens do not know what is the take-away for them and their families in the face of the viral contagion and economic hardship arising from the massive lock down situations. It also became painstakingly obvious how the capacity of each ASEAN member state to manage the pandemic differs. Brunei and Singapore are regarded as having the resources to do testing, contact tracing and treating infected individuals. Vietnam impressed with its no-nonsense whole-of-society approach while it is impossible to do wide-scale testing in Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines and Thailand. Laos and Cambodia appear to be relying on third parties, particularly China, to address any nation-wide contagion due to inadequate healthcare systems and a lack of physicians and equipment. All Not Lost; But Too Little Too Late? Amidst the nationalist turns in tackling COVID-19, there are nonetheless signs that all is not lost. Both the EU and ASEAN have agreed to set up common funds to tackle the economic consequences in the hope that throwing money at the inevitable post-COVID-19 economic slump will rescue both the regional economies and the belief in regionalism itself. Leaders from ASEAN member states, China, Japan and South Korea have agreed to ensure the flow of commodities, food and medical supplies across their borders. There are also attempts to better coordinate procurement and stockpiling of medical equipment across the respective regions. And in the EU, some members have begun treating EU patients instead of just their own citizens to alleviate the pressure on their respective home healthcare systems. Both the EU and ASEAN find that there is a need to coordinate the incremental lifting of restrictive measures and the implementation of such measures for future pandemics so as to minimise the negative impact on supply chains for food, medicine and medical equipment, and manufactured goods. While such efforts and pronouncements are useful going forward, the fact is that they seem too little too late. While ASEAN regionalism will probably emerge relatively unscathed from COVID-19, simply because ASEAN has never had a strong record for coordinating against pandemics and the ASEAN Community is still a nascent work-in- progress, the EU may have suffered serious damage. With 200-times more staff than the ASEAN institutions and a 430-times larger administration budget, expectations on the EU bodies are much higher. That the most integrated organisation the world has ever known has done so little to prove its more sophisticated reputation has undermined its image and credibility."

    "title": "Global Health Security COVID-19: Its Impact on Food Sufficiency",
    "author(s)": "By Paul Teng",
    "date": "No. 048 \u2013 25 March 2020",
    "content": "FOOD IS an existential need for Singapore. That this has always been so was brought home to many Singaporeans when Malaysia\u2019s recent nationwide lockdown on travel massively affected the vital supplies of food to the country via land. While the immediate impact has abated, this has affirmed what is already known \u2013 that Singapore is vulnerable to supply disruptions and its citizens need to be prepared for future shocks to avoid the panic buying that was seen. Singapore\u2019s handling of the COVID-19 threat and its spread has been cited as a model for others. So can Singapore\u2019s response to managing food insecurity similarly become a model for others to replicate? The \u201cPerfect Storm\u201d In January 2020 I wrote an Opinion Piece for the South China Morning Post in which I warned of impending price spikes in food due to a convergence of events in 2019 going into 2020: the African Swine Fever epidemic; the Fall Armyworm eating up large areas of maize; the prolonged drought in Australia reducing exports like wheat; and bushfires destroying rangelands and livestock in Australia. And this was before COVID-19 became recognised as a pandemic. And before food exporting countries started to put into place measures that restricted people movement, and implicitly, movement of people needed in the food supply chain. Production, harvesting, processing and transport of food have been affected in countries which saw infection spikes. Fortunately, governments like China have taken measures to ensure that the planting of new crops and growing of new animals can take place by allowing \u201cgreen channels\u201d to deliver inputs like fertiliser and feed to farming communities, and Singapore has activated alternative supply chains. Forthcoming are threats from swarms of locusts originating from Western and South Asia, and Avian flu. Also not felt as yet has been the impact of reduced food and feed shipments from the Americas to East and Southeast Asia. All these suggest that the coming months will be critical in determining if there will be more supply shocks. The Singapore Food Story Recognising its vulnerability to external events, Singapore launched its \u201cSingapore Food Story\u201d in March 2019, which set a target to produce 30% of Singapore\u2019s nutrition needs by 2030, thereby reducing some of the vulnerability. This represents a 300% increase from the current target of 10%, and builds on the small number of technology- enabled vegetable, egg and fish farms. Since March 2019, there has been a flurry of activities by two lead agencies, namely the Singapore Food Agency and the A*STAR. This has further been accompanied by increased activity in the startup community associated with conventional as well as novel food like \u201cclean meat\u201d and \u201cplant-based protein\u201d. All these augur well to increase the amount and quality of certain food items and also to create the capacity to develop exportable agri-food technologies. But the reality is that any ramp-up in local food production will not be immediately felt and there remains the important need to assure supplies of the other 90 % of Singapore\u2019s current food needs. Addressing the other 90% Singapore imports food from over 170 countries as part of its source diversification strategy. Supply disruptions from one country or group of countries in the same region may be counter-balanced by increasing supplies from other source countries. In principle, this is very sound. In practice, as we saw with the Malaysian lockdown, dependence on any country for a large share of any food item poses both real and perceptual threats. With about 40% of its fresh vegetables and 37% of chicken coming from Malaysia, any lockdown gives rise to the perception of shortage and leads to panic buying. It was only after high-level reassurances of adequate stock and alternative supplies, and visuals of food trucks crossing from Malaysia into Singapore, that the public was re-assured. A lesson learnt is that it may be prudent to ensure that not more than a third of any food item comes from one country, and that there are other countries capable of replacing the amounts of undersupply at short notice. Looking to 2030, even with the 30% target met, attention will have to continue on the other 70%, especially with regards to food which does not make sense to produce in Singapore, such as grains which require much land (like rice) or animals which are highly polluting to grow (like hogs). It is not too early to augment the current diversified sourcing approach with added criteria like a country\u2019s \u201cramp-up\u201d capability to produce more, and its capacity to export under food emergency situations. In this respect, countries with proven regular surpluses of production over domestic consumption for any food item are good candidates. Food Security & Nutrition Security With COVID-19, assuring sufficient food has to be accompanied by adequate nutrition to meet the body\u2019s needs for vitamins, minerals, etc. The longer any mobility lockdown lasts, the higher the risk of unbalanced nutrition occurring. Also, in times of crisis, getting more community participation to deal with the crisis is important. One under-utilised area which can be ramped up in weeks, in anticipation of import limits, is to expand the number of community gardens and allow them to sell their excess produce. This will require the mobilisation of technical resources, inputs and a change in regulations. But vegetables, especially locally adapted and indigenous vegetables are relatively easy to grow and maintain, and most have high nutritive value. Unused urban space in housing estates could also be converted into tastefully landscaped vegetable gardens. Pilot facilities like that announced by Life3Biotech to create Integrated Agri-Food hubs in different parts of the island will also be important to get ownership by the community into growing and valuing food, especially vegetables. While no estimates are available, multiple efforts like these, together with small-scale vegetable growing in the backyards of landed and non-landed properties, when combined with rooftop vegetable growing (common in Seoul, Korea) will do much in the short term to increase the supply of nutritious vegetables."

    "author(s)": "By David Martin",
    "date": "No. 020 \u2013 3 February 2020",
    "content": "\u2018SINGAPORE ON the Thames\u2019 has become an unfortunate shorthand for what many Brexiteers laud as a model for Britain\u2019s economy, now that it has formally left the European Union on 31 January 2020. Unfortunate for Singapore because it promotes a flawed view of its economic success and an international image it could do without. Unfortunate for the United Kingdom because the version of the Singapore model it promotes is both undeliverable and certain to make any trade deal with the EU more difficult, if not impossible, to deliver. Singapore\u2019s Image in Britain The image of Singapore being promoted is that of a low tax (even tax haven), unregulated, small government laissez faire paradise. The advocates of \u2018Singapore on the Thames\u2019 either ignore or are ignorant of the fact that on top of a relatively low tax rate the Central Provident Fund compels workers and employers to contribute 37% of wages and salaries. It ignores the fact the Singapore Government is a major stakeholder in domestic industries from banking to telecommunications. Perhaps above all it ignores the inconvenient truth that a key reason for Singapore\u2019s economic success is its role as a major regional trading hub, most of whose domestic goods exports go to the rest of Asia, and its tight linkages with the cross-border supply chains that are the arteries of modern manufacturing. Brexit, in contrast, threatens to cramp Britain\u2019s trade by impeding businesses\u2019 access to the large single market on its doorstep and disrupting or severing their vital supply chains. If Singapore\u2019s British admirers were promoting its achievements of efficient modern infrastructure, quality education, stable government and rule of law and a business- friendly environment then Singapore could sit back and accept the compliment. But the vision being promoted damages Singapore\u2019s reputation. Low Tax Strategy, or High Investment? In a world where more and more voices (as diverse as Donald Trump and Angela Merkel) are being raised against \u2018unfair competition\u2019, to be perceived as obtaining economic advantage through an inequitable tax regime or weak regulatory standards is extremely damaging. Indeed, the Singapore-EU Free Trade Agreement (FTA) was almost derailed in the European Parliament where false and inaccurate statements were made about Singapore being a tax haven and having draconian anti-labour laws."

    "author(s)": "By Dipinder S Randhawa",
    "date": "No. 030 \u2013 17 February 2021",
    "content": "ON 5 FEBRUARY 2020, President Joe Biden lifted the objections placed by the Trump administration to the appointment of Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala as the new director- general (DG) of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). After an extended search and selection process, Okonjo-Iweala was elected as DG in November 2020, but the Trump administration withheld confirmation at the last-minute contending that she did not have sufficient experience. The selection of a new leader requires a consensus among all WTO members. Born in 1954 in Nigeria, Okonjo-Iweala studied at Harvard University, and earned a PhD at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She worked at the World Bank for 25 years, rising to be the position of managing director, second only to the president of the Bank. She was twice Nigeria\u2019s finance minister and briefly served as foreign minister. Okonjo-Iweala also sits on the boards of Twitter, Standard Chartered Bank and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI). Manifold-Challenges Ahead The cornerstone of the multilateral rules-based global trading system, the WTO currently has 164 members accounting for 98 per cent of global trade. Entrusted with a mandate for free and non-discriminatory trade, the organisation has been without a DG over some of the most turbulent times for the global economy since the early departure of Brazil\u2019s Roberto Azevedo in August 2020. The Biden administration\u2019s embrace of multilateralism has ended the endemic uncertainty engendered by the inimical approach towards multilateral institutions of the previous US administration. An effective WTO holds out great promise for ASEAN as it recovers from the pandemic. The challenges facing Okonjo-Iweala, however, are manifold: The WTO is in crisis. Aside from coping with protectionist moves during the pandemic it is experiencing fundamental challenges to its mandate as well as emerging challenges stemming from technological change and geopolitical tensions. The near paralysis in decision-making has led regional groupings like ASEAN to forge mega free trade agreements (FTA), such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Vaccine Distribution The immediate challenge that the new DG needs to confront is the distribution of vaccines. Developed economies have adopted a me-first approach by using advanced purchase agreements and export bans that could indefinitely delay access to the vaccine for developing countries resulting in extending the pandemic, recurring border controls and the risks of further mutations and economic slowdown. In comparison the costs of global immunisation are minimal. The WTO needs to consider this emerging area of contention. Its existing powers, however, are weak with no clear rules governing the supply chains for medicines, vaccines and medical equipment. Developing countries let by South Africa and India have sought waivers on related patents to allow countries to manufacture the vaccines themselves. Thus far, under pressure from the pharmaceutical companies, developed countries have refused to accede. Most developing economies are yet to secure contracts for vaccines and are dependent on the COVAX programme led by GAVI. Problems Within the WTO The WTO was created in 1995 as a successor to the GATT to serve three main functions: 1. offer a forum for negotiations to liberalise trade and formulate new trade rules to adapt to the changing structure of the global economy; 2. monitor these trade rules; and 3. provide a framework for resolution of trade disputes among members. Since the mid-nineties the three functions of the WTO have been in urgent need of reform. 1 Negotiation Function Despite changes in the global trading landscape, the WTO has failed to revise trade rules to adapt to contentious issues including intellectual property rights, subsidies, non-market economies, and address concerns revolving around labour rights and the environment. Its members are far from formulating rules on digital trade and the use of new technologies. 2 Monitoring Function The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the existing trend of the failure to notify imposition of non-tariff as well as tariff barriers, necessary to ensure transparency and predictability of trading rules. This has engendered a trust deficit and an escalation of disputes. 3 Dispute Settlement System The most visible failure is the near collapse of the dispute settlement mechanism. Several developed countries, led by the United States, contend that the WTO\u2019s appellate body has gone beyond its brief, formulating rules without seeking a consensus and applying them inappropriately to non-market economies. Since December 2019 the US has withheld appointments to the tribunal, effectively precluding a quorum. Concurring with this perspective, Okonjo-Iweala has identified reform of the dispute settlement process as one of her main priorities. Looking Ahead Through the multilateral trading system manifest in the GATT and now the WTO, international trade has been an important engine of employment, productivity, innovation, growth and development across the world, and quite vividly in Southeast Asia. However with the rise of the Internet, e-commerce, servicification of manufacturing, growing inequalities and escalating geopolitical tensions, the WTO is confronted with serious challenges to its mandate. There is a pressing need to clearly define what constitutes a \u2018developing\u2019 or a \u2018developed\u2019 economy; to restore transparency; and trust to member\u2019s actions and establish clear rules on how to deal with departures from market economies. Until multilateral negotiations at the WTO achieve progress, pro-trade members, such as ASEAN, will find recourse in a plurilateral approach, manifest in the creation of RCEP. The new WTO DG faces an immensely difficult task, with the pandemic compounding existing divisions and tensions in the international trading system. Comprehensive reforms and bold initiatives at the WTO offer the best path forward towards an open, inclusive and sustainable regime for global trade."

    "title": "Global Health Security: COVID-19 & Its Impacts Pandemic Fatigue: Re-Examining Re-Opening\u2019s Logic",
    "author(s)": "By Jose M.L. Montesclaros and Mely Caballero-Anthony",
    "date": "No. 149 \u2013 22 July 2020",
    "content": "MAJORITY OF the world\u2019s economies have been on countrywide lockdown since March 2020, when the COVID-19 virus was declared a global pandemic. After months of economic standstill and strict restrictions on movements of people, some economies have started to re-open. In some countries in Europe, malls, restaurants, cafes and schools are slowly getting back to business. In East Asia, we also see relaxation in countries like South Korea, Japan, and Vietnam, albeit calibrated in some like Malaysia and Singapore. The decision to re-open is often a matter of weighing the costs and benefits of doing so. But how decisions are arrived at, drawing on the kinds of costs and benefits involved, can be contentious. Lives vs Livelihoods? A recent article published in the Straits Times, provides an interesting perspective on the so-called \u201clives vs livelihoods\u201d debate. The writers argued that while lives are by virtue \u201cinfinitely priced\u201d, one can actually put a \u201cprice\u201d on life depending on certain situations. The writers posit that lockdowns help save lives but cost livelihoods/incomes; therefore, countries should re-open when the value of the lives saved, falls below the cost of livelihoods lost. Such line of thinking, however, is flawed and simplistic. We argue that it may not be so much a matter of trading lives for livelihoods, as it is about protecting lives and ensuring safety through effective and adequate public healthcare capacity. By putting more efforts in strengthening public healthcare systems, one prevents the binary of having to choose one over the other. Infection Not a Death Knell One would do well to note that a COVID-19 infection does not automatically result in death. In the absence of vaccines, much depends on the capacity of hospitals to support those who suffer from its symptoms, and government\u2019s fiscal capacity to subsidise hospitalisation expenses. In this sense, what spells death is not the number of infections per se. Rather, it is the number of active cases relative to the maximum capacity of the health care system. The case of Singapore is instructive. It expanded its healthcare capacity partly by creating new venues (\u201ccommunity facilities\u201d) to house active COVID-19 patients, while freeing up hospital beds and intensive care for critical patients. For instance, several halls of the Singapore Expo convention/exhibition centre were converted into wards. Each patient was provided with self-help kits to monitor and log vital indicators like oxygen levels, blood pressure and temperature three times a day. Concurrently, the government has supported total in-patient hospitalisation expenses in public hospitals. As a result, Singapore suffered only 26 fatalities out of 46,283 infections as of 13 July 2020, representing a death rate of 5.6 for every 10,000 infected cases. This is very low in contrast to other countries which have reported non-zero fatalities, such as the United States (416.6 deaths for every 10,000) and China (543 deaths for every 10,000 infected), based on Worldometer data the same day. The worst countries included the United Kingdom, Belgium, and France, ranging from 1,500 to 1,900 deaths for every 10,000 infected. Healthcare Capacity as Benchmark What is remarkable about Singapore\u2019s approach to achieving its low COVID-19 death rate, is its cautious and graduated approach to re-opening. It can be observed that its timing of re-opening has consistently been preceded by a declining number of active cases relative to its healthcare system\u2019s maximum physical and fiscal capacity. Daily government updates show Singapore\u2019s active COVID-19 cases (excluding discharged cases and fatalities) peaked at 20,799 on 12 May 2020, providing an indication of the historical maximum number of cases that Singapore\u2019s health care system can accommodate. When Singapore announced its phased re-opening on 28 May, there were 14,932 active cases (71.8% of maximum capacity). On 2 June, when Phase One of re-opening began (e.g., some businesses permitted, primary and secondary graduating cohorts returning to school, and household visits limited to two children/grandchildren), there were 12,637 active cases (60.8% of maximum capacity). On 19 June when Singapore proceeded with Phase Two (e.g., restaurant dine-ins, retail outlets, gyms and schools following safe management measures permitted; social gatherings up to five people allowed), there were 8,130 active cases (40% of maximum capacity). And on 2 July, as more relaxation measures were introduced in the extended Phase Two (some entertainment centres and places of worship permitted), there were only 5,035 active cases or 24.3% of maximum capacity. Steady progress could be observed 11 days after (13 July) with only 3,716 active cases (17.9% of maximum capacity). Key Takeaway: Strengthening Healthcare Systems Relative to Singapore and other countries, the Philippines appears to be a moderate case, with 280.5 deaths for every 10,000 infected, so far (1,599 deaths out of a total of 57,007 infections as of 13 July, based on the Philippines\u2019 Department of Health). It can be argued, however, that the Philippines\u2019 current state of re-opening, is premature. The country was among the earliest to lockdown on 16 March (island-wide strict movement control across Luzon island). At that time, World Health Organisation data reflected less than 150 confirmed active cases, countrywide. Active cases ballooned to 7,109 cases on 1 May. By 2 June, a day after the government began lifting some sanctions, there were 13,968 active cases, practically double that in May. By end-June, this figure nearly doubled again to 26,015 active cases. The extent of government support has also been limited: compared to a Php1.3 million (S$36,600) bill for 15-day confinement of a \u201clevel 3 (severe pneumonia)\u201d patient, the Philippine government had since mid-April capped its support to patients with identical conditions to Php333,000 (S$9,640). The key takeaway from these examples of bringing economies back to life after lockdowns is the importance of strong health care systems. Deciding when to re-open should be contingent on the ability and capacity of a country\u2019s hospitals and other healthcare facilities. It should also depend on its government\u2019s fiscal capacity \u2500 to accommodate, manage and support the numbers of infection cases in their communities."

    "title": "Myanmar: Time for New Regional Diplomacy",
    "author(s)": "By Alistair D. B. Cook",
    "date": "No. 031 \u2013 18 February 2021",
    "content": "THE DETENTION and arrest of elected politicians, officials, community leaders along with a full military takeover of government in Myanmar on 1 February 2021 has demonstrated the fragility of the supposed transition to democracy. Responses from the international community have so far generated toothless statements of concern with some pursuing sanctions. Only New Zealand has suspended diplomatic relations. The international community needs to reflect on its limited actions to date and recognise the changed dynamics in Myanmar, all within the context of a fractured multilateral world. Regional Focus Since the military takeover, countries around the world have delivered a series of statements ranging from condemnation to comments about these developments being an internal affair. There is nothing new here about which countries fell on what side of that debate. One of the first statements was delivered on 1 February by Brunei, the ASEAN Chair for 2021, referencing the ASEAN Charter, the need for political stability and the pursuit of dialogue. Within ASEAN, individual statements calling for a return to normalcy came from Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore in contrast to the notable positions of Cambodia, Philippines and Thailand asserting it as a matter of Myanmar\u2019s internal affairs. While the ASEAN Charter is legally-binding, enforcement needs the collective support of the 10 member states. Within the ASEAN Charter there are provisions for the activation of the good offices of the Secretary-General to engage member states such as that of Surin Pitsuwan in the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis in 2008. We have also witnessed shuttle diplomacy of regional political figures in past political crises. While ASEAN member states have the process to facilitate action, the diversity of opinion within the regional grouping means a more bespoke approach is required. International Interests As many observers have noted, the military removal of the elected government in Myanmar has implications beyond ASEAN. China is deemed a key supporter of Myanmar and Beijing has enjoyed a relatively productive and stable relationship with the National League for Democracy (NLD) government under the leadership of Aung San Suu Kyi. Russia has emerged as a key security partner over the past decade for major arms imports and military training to the Myanmar military as reported in the media. The reliance on Moscow\u2019s support and engagement is perceived as a calculated move by the Myanmar military to counter rising dependence on China as a result of deteriorating relations with the United States and other international players. The US under the new Biden administration has announced sanctions against Myanmar\u2019s military leaders, family members and their business interests. These targeted sanctions reflect a calibrated response as it weighs US options and interests regarding its relations and leadership in the wider Indo-Pacific region. The US may well look to regional partners and allies to provide a more collective, or at least coordinated, response. Japan has invested significantly in Myanmar, and more so under the partially civilian government led by the NLD. Tokyo wants peace and stability in the country. The Japanese government has displayed a keen interest in mediation in Myanmar in previous crises. Australia has recently signed a large aid package and increased its engagement with ASEAN. Canberra will be keen to activate its role as a regional player to support a peaceful resolution of the political turmoil and transition to democracy in Myanmar. Immediate neighbour India has issued a broad statement supporting the democratic transition in Myanmar. New Delhi has been cautiously watching developments in Myanmar and avoiding saying more since the two countries\u2019 military forces are delicately negotiating more security along their common borders. Regional Diplomacy: ASEAN+ Model for Reconciliation? Australia, China, India, Japan, Russia and the US are all important partners for Southeast Asian economic development and regional security. While each of them has diverging interests, it is in their common interest to support the peaceful resolution of the political turmoil in Myanmar. With Japan and Australia as likely partners, efforts to coordinate an effective response may lie in Jakarta. Indonesia is the largest country in ASEAN, has evolved from its own authoritarian past, and is an essential part of the envisioned ASEAN Community. The Indonesian experience was studiously examined by the Myanmar military leaders in their own democratisation process. With its substantial bilateral relationship with Australia and successful partnership with Japan, the Indonesians can activate a diplomatic coalition with ASEAN characteristics to pave the way for dialogue, peaceful resolution and avoid more bloodshed. It behooves ASEAN member states as well as other regional countries to encourage such an initiative for reconciliation and unity. Reimagined Myanmar? A practical coalition of willing ASEAN member states and regional partners presents a pathway to support the people in Myanmar and promote greater stability across the region. Will it be enough to reconcile the opposing forces and continue the transition to democracy in Myanmar? The answer lies in what the alternative is. The fact is an entire generation of young people in Myanmar has come of age since the 2008 constitution. They are internet-savvy and energetic. Their quenchless desire for change and a viable future cannot be dismissed any longer. At the international level, the COVID-19 pandemic is still raging and the world order is under stress from a multitude of structural issues and geopolitical dilemmas. The challenges faced by Myanmar and ASEAN cannot be attended to in a half-hearted way with worn-out ideas and pessimism. It is time for substantive and creative regional diplomacy if the region is to move from a subdued interval to a sustainable future that delivers people-centered peace and security."

    "title": "Global Health Security Coronabonds: Backdoor to Collective Debt?",
    "author(s)": "By Frederick Kliem",
    "date": "No. 070 \u2013 14 April 2020",
    "content": "THE DEBATE about debt pooling among the Eurozone has haunted the single currency ever since it was first conceived. In 1998, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a champion of the Euro, promised a sceptical German public that a common currency would not lead to German liabilities for other economies\u2019 sovereign debt. But as the COVID-19 crisis hits, some southern European governments demand precisely such trans-national liabilities. The Euro was always a political rather than an economic project, and as such, it always had two major flaws. The Euro\u2019s Birth Defect Firstly, the Eurozone is monetary without fiscal union. Monetary policy for the Eurozone is set by the European Central Bank (ECB), while economic and fiscal policy is set on the national level. Such disunion is not sustainable in the long-term without endless redistribution of wealth. This is particularly true if the difference in economic performance and fiscal discipline is as great as that in the Eurozone. Although a clear ruleset and monitoring mechanism exists to maintain the stability of the Euro exists, called the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), those rules are regularly broken by most members (including Germany). And even the most rigorous of European Union (EU) rules, such as its competition law and part of the SGP, were jettisoned immediately as COVID-19 hit Europe. Secondly, the Eurozone is an exclusive club within the EU. Not all EU members use the Euro, creating a two-tier organisation, and Eurozone members recurrently hold EU processes hostage to their monetary quarrels. From \u201cEurobonds\u201d to \u201cCoronabonds\u201d During the Eurozone debt crisis, highly indebted EU countries demanded \u201csolidarity\u201d in the form of collectivising all Eurozone sovereign debt by issuing so-called Eurobonds. Quite rightly, Germany and other fiscally conservative Eurozone members responded with a clear \u201cNein\u201d, no chance. The idea behind Eurobonds is quite simple: All Eurozone countries pool their debt and raise bonds on the markets to borrow at much lower rates than highly indebted individual countries could do unilaterally. The entire Eurozone, therefore, guarantees all Eurozone debt. This was supposed to stabilise the sovereign debt spiral in countries such as Portugal and Greece. The catch for fiscally more disciplined countries is that they would be liable should other governments default on their debt and would have to pick up the bill should others go bankrupt. Wisely, Eurobonds were rejected then, and monies from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the specifically created bailout mechanism, were used instead \u2013 with severe austerity strings attached so that fiscally unsound countries would get excessive national spending in order and debt under control. Eurobonds 2.0 Make no mistake, the sovereign debt crisis never went away entirely and is about to return with a vengeance. Unfortunately, COVID-19 has hit Italy, the Eurozone\u2019s third- largest economy, particularly hard. Italy\u2019s sovereign debt already is at a staggering 135% of GDP, and if Italy struggles, the entire Eurozone struggles. The Euro and banking crisis could return more severe than ever before. On the back of COVID-19, Italy and others raise the issue of Eurobonds once again, only for them to be dubbed Coronabonds. Despite high moral pressure on less indebted countries to accept liability, governments must stand firm and refute any such attempt. Undoubtedly, the Eurozone will have to dig deep to bail out the post-COVID-19 economy if they want to save the Euro (and there is no doubt on that front). But Coronabonds are not necessary. Alternative Ways Out of the Crisis Europe\u2019s financial systems are currently in much better shape than their healthcare systems. Italian and Spanish government debt is high but stable, and bond yields have come down to acceptable levels since 2015, and neither currently have disruptive financial problems. Especially in times of \u201cbearish\u201d stock-markets, government bonds are in demand. The only sound argument in favour of Eurozone bonds is forcing ever deeper European integration, and COVID-19 must not be misused to push such integration through the backdoor. The rise of populist parties was fed by the Eurozone crisis, and Eurobonds will add substantial momentum to those movements in net-contributor countries like Germany and the Netherlands. Moreover, it is unforeseeable how these countries themselves will weather the storm, and how much debt they will have to raise to stabilise their own economies. In Germany, additional COVID-19 spending is some 40% of its entire annual budget; wholly credit-financed and jettisoning Berlin\u2019s sacred \u201cBlack-Zero\u201d, its balanced budget. There is no question that financial help for the Eurozone will come in huge quantity; the only question is by what instruments. Indeed, after several rounds of negotiations, Eurobond-sceptic governments initially prevailed as EU ministers agreed on an EU COVID-19 bailout package, including ESM credits but not Coronabonds. Rome refuses to permanently accept that compromise for now, and fiercely rejects accepting the substantial ESM creditline rightfully available to Italy under the agreement. Although this time ESM-bailouts are unconditional, Rome prefers not to be seen as accepting favours, further contributing to the already strong anti-EU sentiment in the country. So far, EU northerners are resisting debt collectivisation, and one can only hope that their resolve lasts. With Coronabonds the cure is worse than the disease. Contagious Eurozone debt-spirals are not unlikely, and the lasting consequences of a collective debt precedent are unpredictable, including a substantial increase in support for populist parties."

    "title": "Global Health Security: COVID-19 & Its Impacts Pandemic Conundrum: To Control or to Trust?",
    "author(s)": "By Yasmine Wong",
    "date": "No. 132 \u2013 26 June 2020",
    "content": "COVID-19 HAS made salient how individual decisions \u2500 whether relating to movement, personal hygiene, and consumer behaviour \u2500 can profoundly impact others. This interconnectedness renders the private publicly relevant and thus exposes private life to public scrutiny. The effects of this social environment may wear down social trust and social capital within the community. As individual actions come under scrutiny during COVID-19, mutual surveillance has flourished. At the community level, individuals report on one another to the authorities, at times turning to social media to berate socially irresponsible behaviour which includes not wearing a mask in public and flouting safe distancing rules, amongst others. As the world eases into a new normal and society is faced with the reality that safe distancing measures will persist  in some form, the use of mutual surveillance needs to be reconsidered vis-\u00e0-vis its effects on social trust. COVID-19 and the Panopticon The intensified state of mutual surveillance creates a social environment best described as panoptic. The Panopticon was conceived by the English reformer Jeremy Bentham as a social control mechanism. It describes a prison designed to make prisoners aware of the possibility of being under constant watch. With such a prison, prisoners self-police out of fear of consequences. This idea was expanded by the French philosopher Michel Foucault to criticise the modern society disciplined through surveillance. The Panopticon has since been used as a on surveillance and control in everyday life, for example, the new embeddedness of digital surveillance in society. The Panopticon aptly describes lived reality during the pandemic, where the encouragement of mutual surveillance cultivates a panoptic social environment. COVID-19 may prompt suspicion and distrust; this forms part of our \u2018behavioural immune system\u2019. It consists of behavioural and psychological adaptations we undergo to reduce the likelihood of contact with the virus. However, because of this, life during COVID-19 is one exposed to observation and judgment from others. Individuals become more conformist and morally vigilant during a pandemic, resulting in paranoia and harsh condemnation of those who do not similarly abide by safe distancing rules. The Utility and Disutility of the Panopticon In the era of COVID-19, channelling these insecurities to enforce safe distancing rules appear to be a productive way to capitalise on pandemic anxieties. A seemingly convincing utilitarian argument supports mutual surveillance and the cultivation of the panopticon: we are currently in times of unprecedented crisis, and the urgent need to curb the spread of the virus appears to outweigh concerns of privacy. After all, conformity increases when surveillance increases. Governments are also seen to capitalise on mutual surveillance to steer the public towards safe distancing practices. In Singapore, the expansion of the government app and portal, OneServiceApp, allows the population to report cases where safe distancing is breached. Some police forces in England and Wales have also introduced similar reporting platforms. Unfortunately, the community-level, mutual surveillance can prominently manifest in pandemic vigilantism, which encompasses \u201cpandemic snitching\u201d and \u201cpandemic shaming\u201d. In Europe, there were concerns of neighbours turning on each other at the height of pandemic paranoia. The rise of pandemic snitching in Germany has sparked uncomfortable comparisons to its Stasi past, and residents in Toronto and the UK flooded emergency and police lines with reports of safe distancing breaches. Here in Singapore, the rise of pandemic vigilantism culminated in the creation of the \u201cSG Covidiot\u201d Facebook page which shows videos of individuals flouting safe distancing measures. It has gained both traction and notoriety, with many concerned about its legality and ethics due to the prevalence of doxxing and shaming on the page. Trust as a Resource However, the defence of mutual surveillance as a matter of utility obscures its long- term negative social impacts. The mutual surveillance that has emerged during the pandemic occurs through the alienation of individuals seen to flout safe distancing rules, potentially encouraging bullying at the expense of empathy; its risks fuelling social divisions. As surveillance academic Kirstie Ball notes, the conformity that emerges from such surveillance damages the quality of social relations, as it is founded on mutual suspicions and distrust. Social trust is the foundation underlying social relationships. In an ideal society, people exercise trust when interacting with others, expecting others to behave and respond in a certain way. Without trust, uncertainties and friction emerging from daily interactions erode the foundation of community and society. As characterised by political scientist Robert D. Putnam, social trust is indicative of social capital \u2500 a resource that facilitates relationships amongst individuals and enables cooperation and collaboration within society. The presence of social capital indicates that there are networks and norms of reciprocity and trust in society, that individuals are cohesive and have meaningful social engagements. The gravity of declining social capital is especially worrying during a pandemic as social capital is cardinal to resilience and long-term recovery. Social capital, accounting for the bonds which tie communities and citizens together, enables the mobilisation of community efforts and invention of new solutions born of grassroots efforts. Likening recovery from a crisis to recovery from a disease, American academic Daniel Aldrich states that it has more to do with the quality of the host than the nature of the disease. The relationship between social capital and recovery partially explains why places like New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina did not witness a vibrant recovery seen in Kobe after the Great Hanshin earthquake in 1995. The Need to Factor Trust Despite the utility of crowdsourced surveillance to clamp down on the violation of safe distancing laws, it is also crucial to recognise how a social panopticon may negatively affect trust and social capital. As Foucault argued, the effects of surveillance are permanent, and declining social capital is a cause for concern as it cannot be rebuilt overnight, requiring a longer-term approach. The recovery from COVID-19 is a lengthy process. As countries adjust to the new normal and establish new norms to navigate a post-COVID-19 reality, it is important to weigh the short-term gain of constructing a panoptic society with the long-term impacts of its blow on social capital. By trying to save many, we may jeopardise all."

    "title": "Global Health Security: COVID-19 & Its Impacts Indonesia\u2019s Islamic Charities: Plugging Gaps in Economic Relief",
    "author(s)": "By Alexander R Arifianto and Jonathan Chen",
    "date": "No. 126 \u2013 19 June 2020",
    "content": "AS AN emerging economy, Indonesia has made significant progress alleviating poverty within the past four decades. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, however, has not only engendered a massive public health crisis in the country but also dealt a heavy blow to the economic well-being of millions of Indonesians who have lost their jobs and income. Surveys conducted showed that half of Indonesian workers had stopped working as a result of the pandemic. The SMERU Research Institute, a Jakarta-based public policy think-tank, has estimated in a working paper that if the Indonesian economy contracted by 3.2 percent by the end of 2020, it would have resulted in a 9.7 percent increase in the poverty rate. In the worst-case scenario, the poverty rate would increase by 12.4 percent. In real numbers, this translates into 8.5 million more Indonesians becoming poor, virtually wiping out Indonesia\u2019s progress in reducing poverty achieved within the past decade. Limitations of Government Aid The Indonesian government has recently announced a new stimulus package worth 677 trillion Indonesian rupiahs (IDR) (US$47.6 billion). Of this, IDR204 trillion (US$14.3 billion) has been allocated to provide a social safety net for poor citizens affected by the ongoing pandemic. However, observers were concerned that the data of poor Indonesian households who are eligible to receive the stimulus package was based on the last national survey on poverty, conducted in 2014. This means that many affected households would have been bypassed in such an exercise as they are not categorised as poor. The problem is especially chronic among the informal sector workers, who often do not possess a national identity card issued by the city in which they live and work, thus not properly recorded by the census. Bureaucratic red tape has also delayed distribution of the government\u2019s social assistance schemes, particularly in the outer island regions. Filling the Gaps: Islamic Charities Islamic charitable organisations have provided assistance to millions of poor Indonesians since the pandemic was declared as a national emergency in March 2020. These faith-based charities have lately benefitted from significant middle-class support. It is estimated that up to IDR286 trillion (US$20 billion) is collected annually from zakat (obligatory religious alms) and other related contributions. During the pandemic, several organisations have distinguished themselves by providing food, protective health equipment, and other forms of assistance to families in need. Fundraising efforts for COVID-19 and zakat were combined during the Ramadan month of fasting as the number of COVID-19 cases peaked during April and May. Most charities reported a massive increase in donations \u2500 mostly collected online \u2500 as compared to 2019. Foremost amongst them are Lazismu (affiliated with Muhammadiyah, Indonesia\u2019s second largest Islamic organisation) and NU Care- Lazisnu (affiliated with Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesia\u2019s largest Islamic organisation) with a 90 percent increase in donations. COVID-19 disaster relief donations are classified as social funds for humanity (dana sosial kemanusiaan) according to Islamic principles, thus donations in-cash and kind can be distributed to all Indonesian citizens regardless of sectarian preferences. Muhammadiyah and NU Charities For Lazismu, Muhammadiyah\u2019s charity arm, philanthropic efforts are centralised under the newly established Muhammadiyah COVID-19 Command Centre (MCCC). By the first week of June 2020, Lazismu had raised a total of IDR154.8 billion (US$10.9 million) in donations for its pandemic relief, and distributed aid to approximately 3.2 million Indonesians. Muhammadiyah also relies on its 77 hospitals and approximately 300 health clinics located throughout Indonesia \u2013 now designated as referral centres for COVID-19 cases. Due to the decentralised nature of NU, its charity wing Lazisnu (NU Care), depends largely upon its nearly 29,000 pesantrens (Islamic boarding schools) throughout Indonesia to raise charitable funds. A major source of proceeds for Lazisnu came from donations from the Javanese folk singer Didi Kempot\u2019s live-streamed charity concert in April, before his untimely death in May. Lazisnu also raises funds from third-party donations \u2013 mainly funds donated by private companies and state-owned enterprises. However, not all Islamic charities have achieved an uptick in donations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With large-scale social restrictions (Pembatasan Sosial Berskala Besar or PSBB) in place, charities that do not have a significant online presence and still rely heavily on cash donations suffered a significant decline in donations, especially during the month of Ramadan when mosques were shut down due to the nation-wide restrictions. Towards a \u201cNew Normal\u201d It remains to be seen whether the \u201cNew Normal\u201d protocols announced by the Jokowi administration with effect 1 June, represent a boon or bane for Islamic charities in general. Both Lazismu and Lazisnu representatives state that the funds they raised so far only meet a small portion of the total needed by poor Indonesians and the state has a major role to play in alleviating poverty caused by the pandemic. Faith-based philanthrophic bodies have often been seen as a band aid solution to the economic problems faced by the Indonesian state. Realistically, however, Islamic charities also largely depend on the health of the economy and the financial capacity of their donors. While they have contributed significantly to aid poor Indonesians during the ongoing crisis, they need to work together with the state to ensure their poverty alleviation efforts effectively reached those who need it the most. Nonetheless, it is clear that the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic thus far has shown that charities perform a crucial role in plugging the gaps where the authorities may have overlooked or discounted. More importantly, it has forced charities to rethink how they can better source for donations and deliver services under lock-down conditions, either through greater digitalisation for the former and stronger synchronisation for the latter."

    "content": "THE FIFTH anniversary of the death of Singapore\u2019s founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew passed quietly on 23 March 2020. The uneventful day was hardly surprising in a world brought almost to a standstill by the ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is a time of unprecedented crisis, testing the mettle of leadership in every country and the resilience of its people. If he were alive, Mr Lee would have quite a bit to say about leaders and their people in such trying times. He had experienced many such periods in his 35 years as prime minister. What lessons can Singaporeans draw from the way he faced those challenges that might be relevant today? I can think of three. #1: Singapore\u2019s Vulnerability: Myth or Reality? First, was his clear-eyed, unsentimental view of Singapore\u2019s vulnerability: A small island with a multi-racial people with no natural resources completely dependent on the outside world for trade and investments. For him, this was not just an existential fact but one that shaped the policies he developed to ensure Singapore\u2019s survival and success, including the building up of the armed forces, opening the economy to foreign multi-national companies and inducting the best and brightest into government. Years later he worried that a younger generation, raised amid peace and plenty, took success for granted and was increasingly sceptical about the idea that Singapore was vulnerable. Was Mr Lee\u2019s view just an excuse for continuing to keep a tight rein on the city state especially its politics, many wondered. Their scepticism made him decide to work with a group of journalists which I led to write the book Hard Truths published in 2011. In the foreword to the book, he wrote: \u201cI have lived through many economic and political crises in the region and the world. These have crystallised some fundamental truths for me that we forget or ignore at our peril. Without a strong economy, there can be no strong defence. Without a strong defence, there will be no Singapore. It will become a satellite, cowed and intimidated by its neighbours.\" \u201cTo maintain a strong economy and a strong defence all on a narrow base of a small island with over four million people, the government must be led by the ablest, most dedicated and toughest. The task will become more complex as a more educated and"

    "title": "Global Health Security: COVID-19 & Its Impacts Pandemic Response: The Women, Peace and Security Agenda",
    "author(s)": "By Tamara Nair",
    "date": "No. 114 \u2013 8 June 2020",
    "content": "UNDOUBTEDLY, COVID-19 has a disproportionate impact on people, especially as a result of their positions in society and decision-making processes as well as numerous intersectionalities that compound inequalities; that of genders, disabilities, ethnicities, socio-economic class, race and even age. In addition, how these play out in complex emergencies: COVID-19 spreading in refugee camps or communities having to deal with natural hazards and the spread of the virus. These scenarios should also be of great concern to leaders. When it comes to differentiated impacts, UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325: The Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda, with its prevention, participation, protection and role in relief and recovery principles, provides an excellent framework for response strategy for COVID-19. This is certainly a good way to realise ASEAN\u2019s shared commitment to the agenda. WPS Framework and Pandemic Response There might be many who question the relevance of the WPS framework in a global pandemic. After all, the provenance of the agenda lies in the Bosnian war and the Rwandan genocide; both revealed the inadequacies of existing international peace and security systems to address emerging military and civilian transgressions against vulnerable groups, especially against women and girls. At the same time, the recognition of climate-induced struggles, the occurrence of devastating epidemics and the largest mass exodus of people, among other \u2018non- traditional threats\u2019 were looming beyond the horizon. The WPS framework is a transformative one. It hopes for change and as I have suggested elsewhere, the agenda can in fact be used to address the plight of women in the aftermath of natural hazards and in issues of women\u2019s economic insecurities as well. UNSCR 1325 did not conceptualise the WPS agenda with these specific details and the contents of the resolution do not articulate particular events. Despite this, UNSCR 1325 speaks of a people-centric approach and a gendered understanding of human security, creating a shift in thinking and framing contemporary global security issues that lead to inclusive response strategies. What UNSCR 1325 outlines then, is of extreme relevance to response to COVID-19. WPS in Southeast Asia ASEAN already has a strong commitment towards the Women, Peace and Security agenda as outlined in its joint statement in 2017 on promoting women, peace and security in the region. Key in this statement is the \u201cpledge to promote gender equality and reduce social inequalities between men and women in our societies as a way to contribute to longstanding peace and prosperity\u201d and to protect women from \u201c\u2026discrimination and social exclusion.\u201d This will require governments, donors, NGOs and civil societies to work together to reaffirm the region\u2019s commitments to the WPS agenda and gender equality and how these commitments can not only be sustained but be brought to the fore in this time. ASEAN has already taken the right step in establishing, under the aegis of the ASEAN Institute of Peace and Reconciliation, the ASEAN Women for Peace Registry. This studies the WPS agenda in the region among other areas. The registry has representatives from all ASEAN member states. But more can be done. All regional commitments on gender equality and women\u2019s and girls\u2019 rights should be upheld during COVID-19 as well. The principles of the ASEAN\u2019s WPS agenda and other international gender equality standards must fully apply during this pandemic. How can the WPS Agenda Help? The question remains as to how the WPS agenda might be operationalised during COVID-19. How can the four pillars of prevention, participation, protection and the role of women in relief and recovery form a framework for pandemic response for member states in ASEAN or form the backbone for a future regional pandemic response? The answers to these questions lie in how much we listen to and discuss what ground- up evidence-based research tells us about the disproportionate impacts any kind of global crises has on women, be it climate, food, financial or in current times, health crises. How much legitimate space is dedicated to these conversations? Women are affected in a number of ways in these times under COVID-19: from reduced incomes or no incomes, limited movement and healthcare as migrant workers, limited acknowledgment of their value and service as cleaners, canteen operators and even pre-school teachers to carers in homes as well as nurses in hospitals. Men in these jobs are affected as well but much of these jobs in this region, and in fact around the world, are mostly done by women. The majority of food stall owners, carers, cleaners, teachers and frontline healthcare workers around the world are women. Women also form the bulk of informal labour; such work has almost disappeared in this pandemic with lockdowns and closures globally. This has resulted in placing several, especially women, in dire financial situations. Operationalising the Four Pillars of WPS The operationalising of the four pillars of the WPS agenda: prevention of suffering for women; participation of women in planning and implementation of policies; protection of women from economic, psychological or physical violence; and the sustained role of women in relief and recovery processes; integrated within response strategies now can address the gender impacts of COVID-19 that creates disparate levels of suffering between men and women. But how can this happen? There should be more regional conversations happening around how the WPS agenda can help in responding to COVID-19 if we are intent on creating an inclusive response strategy to fight this disease. One such opportunity is being presented by the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. The webinar: COVID-19 and its impacts on the Women of Southeast Asia, hosted by the school, aims to bring together a panel of experts from the region to discuss how the WPS agenda can assist in response strategies for member states during COVID- 19. It will also highlight how such an approach might place ASEAN in a unique leadership position in having adopted this strategy."

    "author(s)": "By Kaewkamol Karen Pitakdumrongkit",
    "date": "No. 034 \u2013 3 March 2020",
    "content": "THE OUTBREAK of the novel Coronavirus or COVID-19 reportedly started in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, China. On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared it as a \u201cPublic Health Emergency of International Concern.\u201d While its fatality rate is around 2%, which is much lower than that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), COVID-19 has been more infectious than SARS. At the time of this writing, WHO reports more than 87,000 confirmed cases and almost 3,000 deaths. Economic Fallout The Chinese economy has been hit hard by COVID-19. One expert at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated that the virus would cost China as much as $196 billion from January to February 2020. The economic fallout has also been felt by other countries, especially those relying on foreign demand and are well-integrated into the global supply chains. For example, there is a reported 25-30% decline of tourists and business travels in Singapore. The Ministry of Trade and Industry cut Singapore\u2019s growth outlook from between 0.5 and 2.5% to minus 0.5 to 1.5%, suggesting that its economy risks heading towards a recession. Bank of Thailand cut down this year\u2019s growth from 3.3% to 2.8% amidst the virus scare. South Korea, the country which has been experiencing a rapid surge of cases to more than 800, reported a decline in domestic consumption and exports to China. Seoul is bracing for more impacts as the infection in the country worsens. As for Japan, the world\u2019s third-largest economy already weakened by the sales tax hike last year, several experts predicted that its GDP would plunge 0.25% this quarter, increasing the risk of a recession. So far, no world leader or international body has issued effective reassurances. For instance, the IMF head Kristalina Georgieva remarked at the recent G-20 Meeting in Saudi Arabia that the outbreak slashed about 0.1 percentage points from the world\u2019s economic growth. Although the Fund anticipated a V-shaped recovery, the IMF chief warned governments that they should \u201cprepare for more adverse scenarios.\u201d Government Responses As COVID-19 has already afflicted several economies across the globe, and the end is still unknown, one pressing economic question stands out front and centre: \u201cHow would countries cope?\u201d Central banks in some Asian countries are seeking to loosen their monetary policy while several governments rolled out their fiscal stimulus packages to prop up their economies. For example, the Bank of Thailand lowered the benchmark rate by 25 basis points to make the historically low rate of 1%. Malaysia announced its fiscal stimulus on 27 February 2020 and expected to unveil a RM20 billion (US$6.6 billion) package to mitigate the adverse effects of COVID-19 on its economy. Likewise, the Singapore authorities announced that they have set aside $4 billion to be injected into the economy to manage the impact of COVID-19 on businesses and households. As for Indonesia, Southeast Asia\u2019s biggest economy, several ministries are on their way to implementing fiscal stimulus following President Joko Widodo\u2019s earlier call to cushion the economy from the effects of COVID-19. Political Economy of Fiscal Policymaking Going forward, many countries will tend to rely more on fiscal policy rather than the monetary one. Although loosening monetary policy is necessary as it sends clear signals to the market that the government is striving to make the economy buoyant, such decreased interest rates alone will likely be insufficient to boost business confidence or convince companies to invest again. It is because this global contagion has exacerbated uncertainties in the world economy, tempting investors to reassess risks and companies to adopt a wait-and- see approach. Therefore, hopes are on the effects of fiscal stimulus on the economy. These policies can be tailored to help specific sectors such as retail, tourism, or other segments which are hard hit by the COVID-19 outbreak. In short, Asia will soon witness increased fiscal expansion. If the crisis escalates, larger such packages are most likely. It is too soon to gauge exactly the details of these fiscal stimulus policies. Yet, the study of Political Economy can be a useful tool to help us think about how the packages will look like. Since several ways exist to design policies to stimulate the economy, Political Economy reminds us that politics largely determine policy outcomes. As policies usually generate different impacts on different segments in the economy, such distribution effects beget losers and winners. These players in turn lobby the authorities to craft policy measures to fulfill their needs and interests. The Logic of Fiscal Stimulus These same logics can be applied to the fiscal stimulus packages coined or about to be coined by Asian governments. Expect fierce lobbying from different firms and sectors as they bid for limited resources. For instance, tourism companies may press the governments to help them find other markets for tourists beyond China. Some manufacturing firms scrambling to adjust their supply chains to be less reliant on Beijing may knock on the authorities\u2019 doors and plead for their assistance. Import-competing industries see the virus situation as an excellent opportunity for them to convince their governments to strengthen the industrial policy to support them instead of exporters. In some countries, small and medium enterprises may collectively persuade the governments to help them as they are the backbone of the economy and contribute to the significant portion of domestic employment. Now is a crucial time to observe how the governments would respond via fiscal policies which could consequently shape the future development of international trade and investment ties. While it is too early to predict these matters in precise terms, the discipline of Political Economy can help us roughly assess how policies will likely turn out to be."

    "date": "No. 012 \u2013 21 January 2021",
    "content": "THE DIPLOMATIC conflict between Australia and China seems to be worsening since it started in 2018. It began when Australia barred Huawei from providing 5G network services in Australia because of security concerns. In February 2020, the Australian Dumping Commission initiated or continued anti-dumping duties on various Chinese steel and aluminium products. And in April 2020, Australia pushed for an international inquiry into the origins of Coronavirus and gathered substantial support among other WHO member countries. It was a move which the Chinese Deputy Ambassador to Canberra termed \u201cshocking\u201d. China retaliated in May and the following months with import suspensions or import delays of Australian beef, barley, cotton, thermal coal, timber, copper, beer and lobster on the basis of \u2018health or consumer protection issues\u2019 or of \u2018quota restrictions\u2019. It also imposed higher tariffs on many other Australian goods such as wines and issued Australia travel warnings for Chinese tourists and students. In May, the Australian government decided to continue imposing anti-dumping duties on Chinese imports. In turn, Australia introduced stricter rules for foreign investments in sensitive assets in June. It also suspended in July its extradition treaty with Hongkong in response to China\u2019s introduction of security legislation in Hongkong. Demand for Apology Which Never Came In December, Australian Prime Minister Morrison directly responded to an image on the Chinese foreign affairs spokesman twitter account depicting a (likely) fake image of an Australian soldier holding a knife to an Afghani child. PM Morrison demanded an apology from China which never came. In an additional step-up of disputes, Australia in mid-December lodged an official appeal with WTO against China\u2019s anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties imposed on Australian barley in May. The Australian Parliament recently also passed a law giving the federal government the power to veto any agreement made by Australian states or universities with foreign countries. This move was widely seen as directed at alleged Chinese interference in Australian politics and economic infrastructure and was possibly another trigger for bilateral relations to further deteriorate. China remains Australia\u2019s largest trading partner, largest export destination and largest source of imports. China remained Australia\u2019s largest two-way goods and services trading partner in 2018\u201319, accounting for around 26 per cent (A$235 billion) of total trade. (Second was Japan at 10% of total trade, or $89 billion). According to Austrade, China was Australia\u2019s largest export destination (33 per cent of Australia\u2019s total exports or $153 billion) as well as import source ($82 billion or 19 per cent of Australia\u2019s import bill or $82 billion). China\u2019s blacklisting of a wide range of Australian commodities and food products has posed serious problems for the affected Australia\u2019s exporters. The government has promised to look into assistance for exporters and also encouraged them to diversify to other markets. This will not be an easy task in the short run considering Australia\u2019s \u201casymmetrical trade with China\u201d in a number of goods with few alternative destinations. Political and Economic Dilemma Australia\u2019s and New Zealand\u2019s trade dependence on China (as well their dependance on China in the tourism and education sector) has created a political and economic dilemma at a time when security and military ties with the US have been intensified under the Trump administration. Verbal mudslinging, blame games and accusations have increased the temperature in the bilateral spat. China has become increasingly vocal and has blamed Australia for deteriorating relations. Chinese diplomats have also shown a more confrontational and nationalistic approach in their public pronouncements on the various escalations on the Australian side. Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhao said: \u201cCertain people in Australia have clung to a Cold War mentality and ideological biases\u2026\u201d. The same sharpness goes for many remarks of Australian politicians. PM Morrison insisted in mid-November \u201cAustralia is a liberal democracy and will not back down\u2026\u201d. For almost a year, there has not been any direct contact between Australian and Chinese government ministers. The downturn in Australia-China relations is also directly related to Australia\u2019s continued strong and close relationship with the US, especially during the Trump administration. At a time of an increasingly hostile geopolitical tug of war between China and the US, Australia, a regional Pacific middle power, is concerned about growing tensions in the Asia Pacific region. It has, therefore, recently shored up its relations with its other old Quad partners, Japan and India and US. Signs of this increased cooperation are the visit to Japan by PM Morrison in December and Australia\u2019s first-time participation since 2007 in the India-led maritime exercise \u2018Malabar\u2019 together with the US and Japan in November - moves that must have irked China. Time for Quiet Diplomacy? The China policy of the Australian centre-right coalition government (Liberal Party and National Party) seems to have played increasingly to a home audience. A number of the government\u2019s parliamentarians belong to a vocal anti-China group. A growing anti- China mood in the Australian political establishment has also been largely supported by a predominantly conservative media landscape belonging to the Rupert Murdoch press conglomerate. It is interesting to note that Liberal Party MP Andrew Hastie, who has become known since 2019 for his acidic criticism of China, was appointed Assistant Defence Minister in PM Morrison\u2019s cabinet reshuffle in December 2020. Critical voices question Australia\u2019s diplomatic strategy and term it short-sighted. The Labour opposition, especially foreign affairs spokeswoman Penny Wong, has criticised the government\u2019s China policy as being inconsistent and demanded to put bilateral relations back on a more normal track. What might be needed now is quiet diplomacy and a reduction in nationalistic and assertive statements. Former Australian foreign minister Gareth Evans stressed the importance of lowering the temperature and going back to a more balanced relationship. Interestingly, the new New Zealand foreign minister Nanaia Mahuta already offered that New Zealand might help negotiate a truce between Australia and China. A renewed dialogue between Australia and China would require less play to home audiences in both countries, less nationalistic grand-standing, greater cooperation on pressing international issues (Gareth Evans called for \u201cworking together on global public goods\u201d) and some quiet discussions behind closed doors. That might just be the right path to make diplomacy work again. An even slightly improved US-China relationship under US President Biden would also be paramount to create a more conducive geopolitical framework. But it will certainly take a lot of effort to restore confidence between China and Australia."

    "title": "Hybrid Threats and Hybrid Warfare: Time for a Comprehensive Approach?",
    "author(s)": "By Mikael Weissmann, Niklas Nilsson, and Bjorn Palmertz",
    "date": "No. 094 \u2013 14 June 2021",
    "content": "DESPITE THE attention and a growing body of studies on specific issues focusing on hybrid threats and hybrid warfare (HT&HW), there is a lack of research that would provide a comprehensive approach towards identifying, analysing, and countering HT&HW challenges. Helping to fill this gap is a recently published volume on hybrid warfare by the Swedish Defence University which outlines key observations on the varying threats as well as the tools and means to counter them, along with a number of real-world case studies. Strategic Challenge HT&HW refer to the strategic blending of conventional and unconventional means of power and influence. This terminology has rapidly gained traction in the Western public and political debates, where it has evolved into an all-encompassing view, particularly reflecting Russia\u2019s international behaviour at the strategic, operational and tactical levels. Strategies involving HT&HW have been enacted out of a perceived necessity to challenge Western military supremacy by other means and to describe the varying asymmetric ways of waging conflicts by Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, and certain non-state actors, particularly ISIS and Hezbollah. Iran, for example, has devised a strategy of guerrilla warfare performed largely by proxy forces in areas outside Iran\u2019s territory amid perceived existential threat posed by the United States. The diffusion of varying hybrid threats essentially challenges the Western binary thinking on war and peace as well as conventional and unconventional warfare. Hence, there is a need for a more comprehensive understanding of how adversaries may innovatively combine a range of foreign policy tools to target the particular vulnerabilities of Western societies and circumvent their existing defensive structures. The Western Response The Western response to these threats fundamentally boils down to the question of the capacity of its national and international institutions to confront HT&HW by understanding the particular vulnerabilities in their societies, addressing them, and devising responses to hostile measures by external actors. Open societies built on the normative foundations of the rule of law, human rights and democracy, protective of the freedoms of speech, association, and the press, need to devise solutions that preserve these fundamental freedoms and draw on their particular strengths. This work is well underway, in the form of numerous entities tasked with analysing and addressing the problem. Key actors such as NATO and the European Union have devised a series of detection and response mechanisms focused on providing early warning and attribution of aggressive actions, as well as deterrence and retaliation. These reactions reflect a common realisation of previously unidentified weaknesses in Western societies and joint efforts to close these gaps. There are also successful examples of countermeasures against HT&HW. For example, Ukraine has, in the midst of an armed but covert attack against the country, proved capable of combining a conventional military response with a sustained informational campaign. This has, despite the severe losses incurred, served to expose Russia as the aggressor and consolidated domestic cohesion as well as international support for the country. Forging a Comprehensive Approach There is no single response to HT&HW, nor to building resilience. Nor can any single actor or structure succeed in this endeavour. Governments must accept reality, while adapting and re-adapting along with the varying opponents and threats. So how do we address these challenges in practice? There is a need for pragmatism, flexibility and inclusiveness of actors, sectors and levels \u2013 within and between countries. Hybrid measures will be unexpected by design, and when countermeasures are successful, the opponent will change patterns of attack. This calls for a strategic approach inclusive of all relevant actors and short- and long-term perspectives. resilient societies will enhance These cannot be separated; long-term vulnerabilities are the target for hybrid warfare, responses and and countermeasures. The development of total- or comprehensive defence capabilities provides a potentially successful model. the effectiveness of It is also crucial that key international and regional organisations cooperate with various partners both within and outside their usual area of engagement. Moreover, dedicated organisations such as the Hybrid CoE and the different NATO centres of excellence are key platforms. While part of NATO and many of the dedicated centres, the United States is a key power capable to protect Western democracies against HT&HW. Multi-dimensional Collaboration It is also essential to collaborate across sectors and levels and to reduce obstacles posed by traditional borders. When countering HT&HW, vulnerabilities tend to exist precisely in the seams between sectors and levels, making them potential targets. One key answer can therefore be found in the collaboration between the military, political, economic, civilian and informational spheres \u2500 evolving across the public and private sectors, and between local and regional levels, through the national to the international level. Combining various skillsets and perspectives is critical when building analytical capability, societal awareness and resilience or directly countering HT&HW. Cross- sector collaboration does not only increase the possibility of early warning, a wider field of view and greater contextual knowledge. It also affords decisionmakers a more precise brief regarding the proactive or reactive measures at hand, and how they can be combined. There is no single correct approach on how to counter and respond to HT&HW threats, nor how to build resilience. Therefore, we have to take it for what it is, build on our strengths, limit access to our vulnerabilities and always adapt as threats, opponents and methodologies evolve and take new shapes."

    "date": "No. 124 \u2013 17 August 2021",
    "content": "EUROPE SEEMS to be resetting its relations with Muslims and Muslim societies in parts of the continent. Despite denials, targetted police actions against certain groups like Muslim Brotherhood (MB) and Hamas in Austria and proposed legislations to regulate religious and cultural practices of Muslims in France, for example, betray attempts to avenge terrorist attacks in many European cities. Riding on an increasing wave of Islamophobia in Europe characterised by the emergence of anti-Islam groups and anti-Islamic narratives, official assertions that investigations and raids were \"not targetted at Muslims or Islam as a religious community\" but rather to protect them, do not instil confidence among the targetted community. The government rhetoric has all the appearance of conflating identities and what Umit Vural, the president of the Islamic Religious Community in Austria said, blending violent extremism with \u201creligious orthodoxy\u201d. Response or Over-Reaction? To be sure, Europeans have reasons to be wary of increasing violence by disparate extremists, particularly at the behest of ISIS. The group is lashing out to retain its credibility after the collapse of its caliphate project in Syria and Iraq. However, reacting to attacks by a small group of ISIS loyalists with extreme punitive measures and social and cultural segregation can surely be counterproductive. Ultimately, these would give rise to right-wing extremism and result in the emergence of divided and dangerous societies. On 2 November 2020 a lone gunman of Albanian ethnicity and a suspected ISIS sympathiser went on a shooting spree in Vienna, Austria that left four dead and 30 injured. Following the attack, Austrian authorities conducted large-scale operations against more than 70 individuals and several organisations linked to MB and Hamas in the country, targeting the bulk of their infrastructure including their finances and logistical support networks. Using the public angst against the attack, the Chancellor Sebastian Kurz declared that he would criminalise \u201cpolitical Islam\u201d. The July 2021 anti-terror law mandated regulation of all religious activities in the country. This advanced Chancellor Kurz\u2019s 2018 crusade against \u201cIslamgesetz\u201d, a Habsburg-era law regulating relations between the state and its Muslim citizens including rights and freedoms of Muslims in the Habsburg empire. At the same time Austrian police launched operation \u201cLuxor\u201d against alleged terrorist networks raiding homes, businesses and associations and arresting dozens of people. Brotherhood in Europe Despite its contested past, MB rose to power after the Arab Spring. Its leader Muhammad Mursi, who was elected as head of the government in Egypt, became a darling of many Western countries, including the United States, even though they had adored the autocratic Hosni Mubarak before him. Mursi\u2019s mediations in the Palestine issue at the time were welcome, even as Hamas was running part of the show. When Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi came to power in Egypt on the back of a counter-coup against the Arab Spring, MB again became a pariah for the same Western actors. Now it is an organisation that is banned in its own country. The group is selective in its membership in Europe and have been quite successful in influencing sections of the Muslim communities in some countries. Its alliances with Hamas and Hezbollah have reinforced its militant side. Even with the ban in Egypt and despite immense pressure from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries, MB has not been designated a terrorist organisation by all countries, including the United Kingdom. Lobbying against the organisation in the US also did not succeed. In Europe, Austria and France have been at the forefront of targeting the MB. Emmanuel Macron introduced the \u201cLaw Reinforcing Respect of the Principles of the Republic\u201d to empower the government to permanently close houses of worship and dissolve religious organisations, without court order, if it finds that any of their members are provoking violence or inciting hatred. Far-right Islamophobic organisations like EDL (English Defence League) and Stop Islamisation of Europe have embraced Austria\u2019s strong-arm tactics to prevent Europe turning into a \u201cNew Mecca\u201d. Many others see this as an opportunity to take further steps to gag Islamic practices and even, highly controversially, ban the Quran. All Not the Same Mainstream Muslims are discomforted by the move of the Austrian government despite them not supporting extremist organisations. Many believe that the Austrian or French measures are affronts to the Muslim culture and religion, not purely security imperatives as claimed. The Austrian and French measures have led to existential anxieties in the Muslim communities across Europe. Earlier, Austria, Hungary and the Czech Republic were criticised by European Muslims for publicly voicing support for Israel\u2019s operations against Hamas in Gaza during May 2021 Sheikh Jarrah tensions in Jerusalem. There are allegations that the US Jewish Lobby is indirectly funding and backing these governments to counter the spread of Islam in Europe. Others like Spain, Belgium, Sweden and Denmark are increasingly wary of the presence of a significant number of refugees and ex-fighters from Syria and other war- torn countries in Africa. Tensions between secular Europe and a growing radical Muslim milieu allegedly under the influence of the \u201cinflammatory rhetoric\u201d of foreign-born imams is driving a small number to launch attacks across Europe. It is in this context that Charles Michel, President of the European Council, called for establishing an \u201cinstitute to train imams in Europe\" to regulate the Internet. While the targets of Austrian and French actions are, arguably, the terrorists, their governments\u2019 public narratives have made these look anti-community. While MB and its backers \u2013 Turkey and Qatar \u2013 wonder if other European countries would follow suit, it appears that, for better or for worse, Europe\u2019s relations with Muslims may be evolving."

    "title": "Jokowi\u2019s Sixth Reshuffle: Securing His Legacy?",
    "author(s)": "By Alexander R Arifianto",
    "date": "No. 073 \u2013 30 April 2021",
    "content": "ON 28 April 2021, Indonesian president Joko Widodo (\u2018Jokowi\u2019) conducted the sixth reshuffle of his cabinet since he first assumed the presidency in October 2014. The latest round of reshuffle was triggered driven by the administration\u2019s decision to transform the Investment Coordination Board (BKPM) into a cabinet-level Ministry of Investment. It is also motivated by the decision to merge the Ministry of Research and Technology with the Ministry of Education and Culture. Probably most key was Jokowi\u2019s promotion of the current BKPM head Bahlil Lahladalia as the new Minister of Investment. Prior to this, Bahlil was an entrepreneur and chair of the Indonesian Young Businesspeople Association (HIPMI). Bahlil is expected to transform the investment ministry as the primary institution to raise funds for the development of Indonesia\u2019s new capital, located in the New Paser Regency in East Kalimantan. New Investment Ministry and Its Importance The capital project \u2013 scheduled to be completed when Jokowi leaves office in 2024 \u2013 is estimated to cost 467 trillion Indonesian Rupiah (S$42.8 billion), of which 90 percent would be raised from private foreign direct and portfolio investment. While Jokowi has created several new institutions which would support the development of the new capital, including the country\u2019s newly inaugurated Sovereign Wealth Fund, so far new investment pledges obtained from prospective investors to finance the capital is still far below target. Hence, in his new ministerial portfolio, Bahlil is tasked to significantly raise new foreign investment commitments to Indonesia over the next few years \u2013 much of it would go to financing the construction of the new capital. He is also expected to assist the promotion of the newly enacted Indonesia\u2019s Omnibus Law for Job Creation and on its numerous fiscal and tax incentive schemes offered to firms seeking to invest in Indonesia. Promoting Education Reform In the mini-reshuffle, Jokowi reconfirmed the appointment Nadiem Makarim as the Ministry of Education and Culture, despite rumours in the Indonesian media that he was about to be replaced. A technocratic businessman who founded Gojek \u2013 one of Indonesia\u2019s largest information technology company, Nadiem\u2019s tenure as minister over the past two years has been marked by several controversies. One in particular surrounds Nadiem\u2019s proposal to reform  the national education curriculum to fast-track Indonesia to become one of the world\u2019s leading high- technology innovation nation by the time Indonesia celebrates its 100th anniversary as an independent nation in 2045. The reform proposal has come under criticism because it seemingly ignores the poor performance of Indonesian primary and secondary school students in their reading, writing, and arithmetic scores compared to their international peers, casting doubts on the feasibility of the reform plan. By letting Nadiem to remain in the education portfolio, Jokowi also reaffirmed his commitment to Nadiem\u2019s ambitious reform agenda. However, he also denied the aspiration of some activists from Muhammadiyah \u2013 Indonesia\u2019s second largest Islamic organisation \u2013 and the National Mandate Party (PAN), its affiliated political party, to have Nadiem replaced by one of their cadres. Since Indonesia\u2019s democratic transition in 1998, the Education and Culture Ministry has traditionally been held by a Muhammadiyah-affiliated minister, while the Religious Affairs Ministry is held by a minister affiliated with Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) \u2013 Indonesia\u2019s largest Islamic organisation \u2013 currently Yaqut Cholil Qoumas, the former head of NU youth wing. This tradition was broken when Jokowi first assumed the presidency in 2014. Two out of three education ministers under his administration \u2013 including Nadiem \u2013 are from a non-Muhammadiyah background. By keeping Nadiem in his position, Jokowi signalled that he preferred the ministry to be led by a professional technocrat instead of a political appointee which would unnecessarily increase the size of his already large political coalition. New Research and Innovation Agency Finally, Jokowi appointed Laksana Tri Handoko, the current head of the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) \u2013 the government\u2019s official research think-tank, as the head of the newly created National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN). This agency is expected to merge all existing research and technology agencies within the Indonesian civil service. This includes LIPI, the Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) \u2013 which is responsible to promote the application of new technological innovations, and the in-house research institutes located inside various Indonesian ministries. Nonetheless, by appointing Laksana as the new BRIN head, Jokowi signalled that LIPI will become the lead government agency which promote research, technological development, and knowledge dissemination in Indonesia. The new agency is also expected to implement the National Research and Technology Law enacted in August 2019. This law authorises it to issue regulations and award research grants for scientific research in Indonesia\u2019s higher education institutions. BRIN is also expected to be the agency which will implement a new research permit scheme for international scholars and researchers who wish to do research in Indonesia. Three Priorities in His Last Three Years With this latest cabinet reshuffle, Jokowi seems to be settling on the mix of political parties, technocrats, and businesspeople within his cabinet. Given this stability, he sees no need to expand his coalition further to accommodate additional parties or interest groups. If anything, the reshuffle has strengthened the role of professional technocrats and businesspeople as chief executives of key ministries such as Investment and Education. The reshuffle also revealed Jokowi\u2019s three priorities during the final three years of his presidency, respectively: to secure investment commitments to develop Indonesia\u2019s new capital \u2013 his primary presidential legacy; to reform the nation\u2019s education system; and to encourage more scientific research and innovation to realise Indonesia\u2019s potential as one of the leading economic and information technology powerhouses in the world by the middle of the 21st century."

    "title": "Rampage at the US Capitol: Historic Second Impeachment",
    "author(s)": "By Irm Haleem",
    "date": "No. 008 \u2013 15 January 2021",
    "content": "THE RAMPAGE at the US Capitol by a mob, which significantly represented all socio- economic sectors of the population, has been popularly labelled as an insurrection. Historically, insurrections have implied revolutions and rebellions against injustices and oppression. However, the right-leaning mob that stormed the Capitol was motivated instead by fascistic and neo-Nazi sentiments that favour intimidation, terror, and the perpetuation of inequalities in the name of racial and ethnic superiority of one group over the others. For a country that has historically presented itself as a secular, liberal democracy, the audacity of the storming of a US government building by such a mob not only shatters the image of America as the custodian of liberal democracy worldwide but presents itself as a kind of an American \u2018blasphemy\u2019. An American \u2018Blasphemy\u2019 I suggest that the storming of the US Capitol by a right-leaning mob represents itself as an American \u2018blasphemy\u2019 for three distinct reasons: First, the regalia of the mob that stormed the Capitol involved painted declarations of unconscionable statements such as \u2018Camp Auschwitz\u2019, or \u20186MWE\u2019 \u2500 translated as \u20186 million weren\u2019t enough\u2019, a reference to the Jewish victims of Nazi Germany \u2500 that stand as a stark irony for a country that is Israel\u2019s \u2018best friend\u2019. Second, the chanting of \u201cthis is my America\u201d while storming the Capitol have been decrypted as a rejection of liberal, multiracial democracy, which is grounded in an unapologetic support for the dominance of the \u2018majority\u2019 over the \u2018minority\u2019, and not a rejection of injustices and oppression. And third, the carrying of the Confederate flag into the Capitol building, historically a symbol of slavery, has been interpreted as the mob\u2019s support for racial inequalities. I propose that acts of \u2018blasphemy\u2019 can be explained with reference to philosophical notions and their particular manifestation in contemporary America. Tyranny of the Majority What has now been dubbed the \u2018mob rule in the Capitol\u2019 is strikingly similar to the predictions of Alexis de Tocqueville (1805-1859), the French philosopher who wrote the prophetic book, Democracy in America (1835), after his travels through America in 1831. Tocqueville considered the tyranny of the majority to be a central feature of American democracy, characterised by the domination of the majority group over the minority group; the propensity towards populist demagogues that justify such domination as patriotism; and the subsequent \u2018patriotic fervour\u2019 that becomes instilled in the \u2018majority\u2019 by such demagoguery, which leads to the creation of militias that dominate and intimidate the minority population with impunity. In contemporary America, we have witnessed this demagoguery in the personification of Trump\u2019s presidency and his rallies that have demonised the non-white immigrant and racial minorities as the reasons for the economic miseries of the white middle class. Such demagoguery has served to embolden and radicalise the disgruntled populace that has come to view political empowerment as an entitlement that can be expressed through violence. The storming of the Capitol by a right-leaning mob with impunity is a stark illustration. The Libertarian Factor In essence, American democracy is founded on libertarian principles of limited government and individual rights. Libertarianism was popularised by John Locke, the British philosopher who is regarded as the \u2018father of liberalism\u2019 and the inspiration behind the American constitution. Libertarianism in contemporary America has morphed into two distinct varieties: right- libertarianism and left-libertarianism. The critical significance of right-libertarianism is that the right-wing and far-right groups and movements in America have come to justify their militancy, hate, and violence in terms of their individual rights to action at best, and their perceived \u2018sovereign citizenship\u2019 at worst. This attitude regards all other citizens as merely fake Americans against whom all actions are considered legitimate and indeed necessary, even that of violence and terrorism. This leads to impunity in actions in cases of political militancy, and absurdity in other cases such as the rejection of mask-wearing during the COVID-19 pandemic on ground of individual rights, despite the tragedy of unprecedented levels of pandemic-related deaths in America. In politics, right-libertarianism has also meant a support for individual, private ownership of military-grade weaponry; an unapologetic display of hateful views in public while adorning such weaponry; a rejection of mainstream libertarianism and liberal notions of equal rights and justice for all; and the ironic relegation of any political opposition as a threat to the authenticity of America. The storming of the Capitol by right-leaning mobs is then just one manifestation of a mindset which is grounded in a sense of unaccountability that is justified with reference to unqualified individual rights. Paradox of Tolerance The paradox of tolerance essentially states that unlimited tolerance can lead to intolerance because it would allow violent, intolerant groups to fester and destroy an open society. The complexities of a democratic society are that freedom will invariably be understood in various ways. Hate groups understand their freedom in terms of their right to reject and use violence against whom they consider as outsiders; they do this under the guise of their freedom and agency, and their belief that their intolerance should be tolerated in a democratic society. The storming of the Capitol by an emboldened right-leaning mob starkly illustrates this paradox. In his book, The Open Society and its Enemies, Karl Popper (1902-1994) argues that while the mere utterance of intolerant views is not incompatible with an open society, the advocacy of violence is. Violent groups must thus be suppressed through judicial processes to preserve an open, liberal democracy. This applies to the case of the right-leaning mob that stormed the Capitol building, but it also ought to apply to President Trump for his incitements to violence. Historicism and Dangers of Second Impeachment Richard Falk, an American professor emeritus of international law at Princeton University, describes Trump\u2019s incitement to \u2018militant and violent demonstrations at the US Capitol\u2019 as having \u2018shaken the foundation of American constitutionalism, symbolically and substantively\u2019. Others, including Capitol Hill journalists, have referred to Trump\u2019s incitements as a sedition in all its accurate senses."

    "title": "Malaysia\u2019s Political System: End of Permanent Coalitions?",
    "author(s)": "By Wong Chin Huat",
    "date": "No. 076 \u2013 5 May 2021",
    "content": "IN THE latest survey results released by pollster Invoke, 51% of Malaysians polled in February 2021 were not sure which party to vote for if the election was called then, while another 17% declined to answer. Of the remaining 32%, half (16%) chose Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin\u2019s Perikatan Nasional (PN) while Barisan Nasional (BN), Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) and Pakatan Harapan (PH) enjoyed pathetic support of 8%, 4% and 3% respectively. The low support for all parties reflects voters\u2019 disillusion and frustration with the rapid political changes that have taken place since 2015, peaked in 2018 with the ouster of BN followed by the collapse of the PH government 22 months later. Malaysia\u2019s Permanent Coalitions: Fading Out? When Muhyiddin assumed power in March 2021, PN then was meant to be a grand coalition of Malay and native parties including his Malaysian United Indigenous Party (Bersatu), United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), PAS and the ex-BN Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS). Now mainly the pact of Bersatu and PAS, PN would be challenged by both PH, the official opposition, and an UMNO-led BN in the next election. UMNO sets its goals to annihilate Bersatu, its splinter formed in 2016 and home to UMNO\u2019s 15 defected parliamentarians. At the heart of realignments is the fading out of permanent coalitions, the only way of multi-ethnic, multiparty power-sharing that Malaysians have known since independence. In countries where no one party can win a simple majority in the parliament, coalitions are commonly formed to ensure political inclusion and stability. But most of these coalitions are formed after election, negotiated based on seat strength and meant to last for only the parliament\u2019s term. Coalition partners are to contest against each other in the next election and which parties would form the next coalition government depends on parties\u2019 new parliamentary strength. Political Inclusion and Stability In permanent coalitions, parties stick to each other before, during and after elections. Not only do they not contest against each other, they try to pool support for each other. Parties in permanent coalitions are akin to formalised factions in parties, except that they maintain separate organisation structure, leadership and party label to appeal to different social constituencies. The idea of permanent coalition was introduced in Malaysia by circumstance. In 1952, UMNO faced a crucial challenge by its multi-ethnic splinter Independence of Malaya Party (IMP) led by its founder president Dato\u2019 Onn Jaafar in Kuala Lumpur\u2019s inaugural municipal election. An ad-hoc and local electoral pact between UMNO and the then Malayan Chinese Association (MCA) was rewarded with a landslide, soon giving birth to the Alliance which was subsequently joined by the then Malayan Indian Congress (MIC). Against the background of a Chinese-dominant communist insurgency, a permanent coalition with parties representing different ethnic groups was seen by both the British and Malayans as the only guarantee of political inclusion and stability. The Alliance model was so dominant that it was copied in Sabah and Sarawak by the local parties on the eve of Malaysia\u2019s formation. To reduce political competition, Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak merged the three regional Alliance and co-opted opposition parties including PAS into the enlarged coalition of BN in 1974. This idea was eventually copied by the opposition in 1990 after UMNO\u2019s schism between Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and his former finance minister Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah. His splinter party, Semangat 46 (S46), brought together PAS and the Chinese-dominant and secular Democratic Action Party (DAP) to form the \u201csecond\u201d multiethnic coalition as BN\u2019s alternative. A Two-Coalition System? Modelling on the British two-party system, a system of two multi-ethnic and centrist permanent coalitions was seen as the only way to dislodge UMNO-BN. Instead of PAS and DAP attacking BN from the ethnic flanks accusing UMNO and MCA as sell-outs of their respective community, an opposition united front induced their moderation with the prospect of winning power. The \u201ctwo-coalition system\u201d, however, had a friend and foe in the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) electoral system. While it encouraged parties to pool votes to win ethnically mixed constituencies, it also overly weakened the loser between the two permanent coalitions that their communal components were tempted to return to their ethnic or regional flanks. This resulted in the collapse of Razaleigh\u2019s united front, followed by Barisan Alternatif (BA), Pakatan Rakyat (PR) and ultimately BN after its ousters in 2018. In the first three episodes, PAS\u2019 push for harsh Hudud punishments in PAS-administered states prompted DAP to break ties. The two-coalition project was rescued by UMNO\u2019s successive schisms, first between Mahathir Mohamad and his deputy Anwar Ibrahim who led BA and PR, then between Prime Minister Najib Razak and Mahathir since 2015. Najib successfully drew PAS out and changed the opposition coalitions\u2019 formula of an UMNO splinter \u2014 S46 and subsequently PKR \u2014 leading PAS and DAP. The 2018 election was fought between BN, PAS and PH which contained two UMNO splinter parties \u2014 PKR and Bersatu \u2014 and DAP and PAS\u2019 splinter Amanah. When BN disintegrated within months after its defeat due to exodus of East Malaysian parties and defection of UMNO parliamentarians, UMNO and PAS formalised their pact to take on the then Mahathir-led, multiethnic PH, which they accused of betraying the Malays. End of the Two-Coalition Project? The fading out of permanent coalitions spells the end of the two-coalition project. While it has successfully dislodged UMNO, it cannot sustain a stable and multi-ethnic permanent coalition in the opposition, not until power is decentralised, incumbency advantages are reduced and a healthy non-communal divide is found between the government and the opposition. With the current power struggle between UMNO, Bersatu and PAS, even a permanent coalition in government is not possible. The next election is likely to deliver a hung parliament and another post-election coalition, with East Malaysians as guaranteed kingmakers. Even if UMNO and DAP were to team up in the event of a PKR defeat, the deal would likely be one-term at a time for both because UMNO cannot defragmentise Malay politics to restore its hegemony and DAP will not want to be an MCA 2.0. The end of permanent coalitions need not be bad news for political inclusion and stability in Malaysia. With proper reforms, post-election coalitions may give Malaysia real stability in competitive politics."

    "title": "The Evolving Role of Malaysia\u2019s Royalty",
    "author(s)": "By Piya Sukhani",
    "date": "No. 107 \u2013 12 July 2021",
    "content": "PRIME MINISTER Muhyiddin Yassin has agreed to reopen the country\u2019s suspended parliament for a five-day sitting from 26 July 2021. This comes after the Malaysian King called on 16 June for parliament to be reconvened as soon as possible. This was a contradiction of Muhyiddin\u2019s previously proposed timeline for reopening the House by September at the earliest. The rulers have held a largely symbolic position since Malaysia\u2019s Independence, but their role in national politics has become increasingly prominent and critical, particularly since 2020, when political fragmentation reached the point where no coalition had a clear and substantive parliamentary majority. Royalty in Politics Following Mahathir Mohamad\u2019s abrupt resignation as premier in February 2020, King Sultan Abdullah took centre stage in seeking to resolve a week-long impasse by interviewing each of Malaysia\u2019s 222 Members of Parliament (MPs) to determine who enjoyed a majority in parliament. The monarch then announced that Muhyiddin had the support of most legislators and swore him in as prime minister on 1 March 2020. While this majority was not proven in parliament, the King\u2019s move was within his constitutional rights. However, challenges to the legitimacy of Muhyiddin\u2019s administration continued. Reports were rife of backroom horse-trading between Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim and the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) \u2500 the largest party supporting the governing coalition \u2500 to unseat Muhyiddin. In October 2020, Anwar met the King claiming to have secured a formidable majority though this was not immediately endorsed by the monarch. That in effect, affirmed the Muhyiddin administration. Complexity of Emergency Rule In the same month, the King and his fellow rulers rejected Muhyiddin\u2019s request to declare an emergency ostensibly meant to enable the government to control the COVID-19 outbreak. In January 2021, Muhyiddin appealed again for emergency rule. The King\u2019s assent this time was widely seen as Muhyiddin\u2019s political lifeline, allowing him to suspend parliament and enact laws without legislative approval. Muhyiddin\u2019s hold on a parliamentary majority had come into serious question. The state of emergency was imposed immediately after two UMNO lawmakers withdrew support from the Perikatan Nasional (PN) government. Critics argue that Muhyiddin has abused the vast powers of the emergency rule to shield himself from a no- confidence vote. The King\u2019s initial decision to reject the request for the emergency was seemingly aligned with public sentiment since there was broad support for his position. However, his inability to reject Muhyiddin the second time demonstrated the limits of the royalty\u2019s constitutional power vis-\u00e0-vis the prime minister. As COVID-19 cases rise and the economy falters, the PN government has faced an intense public backlash over the last few months. The public implored the royalty, with its moral authority, to intervene and check the government. The royalty also came under strong criticism on social media platforms, especially from younger ethnic Malays. Confronted by unprecedented pressure from Opposition camps and civil society, the King and his fellow rulers publicly called for a return to the legislative process. In a special statement on 16 June, the monarch urged parliament to reconvene \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. Significance of Monarchy\u2019s Recent Statements In Malaysia\u2019s constitutional monarchy system, nine Malay state rulers rotate to serve as king for five-year terms. The monarchy holds the constitutionally enshrined status as protectors of the Malay culture and Islam in Malaysia. The 16 June statement from the national palace calling on parliament to reconvene with haste came after the King hosted a special Conference of Rulers\u2019 meeting with the eight Malay state rulers. The outcome of the King\u2019s initiative to call the meeting had buoyed public confidence in the royalty. Following the special meeting, a separate statement was issued by the brother rulers advising against the extension of the nationwide state of emergency, due to expire on 1 August. While both the statements emphasised the urgent sitting of parliament, the statement by the rulers was more incisively phrased than the King\u2019s. The monarch\u2019s statement kept mum on the matter of extending the state of emergency. This was notable because it is only the King who can assent or reject the government\u2019s advice on the emergency. Royal Pushback While acknowledging the royal statements, Muhyiddin had initially been unclear on when exactly parliament would be reconvened. Without oversight from parliament, the PN government, under the National Recovery Plan, was planning to tap into Malaysia\u2019s RM17 billion National Trust Fund, largely generated from petroleum revenue, to pay for vaccinations and related expenses. On 30 June, the King followed through with an urgent meeting with the Speakers of the Lower and Upper Houses. Following the meeting, the monarch reiterated his call for parliament to reconvene, to debate two bills on the emergency before 1 August. Opposition politicians were quick to assert that any excuse to delay the reconvening of parliament would be an affront to the monarch and would \u201cbesmirch the nobility and wisdom of the royal institution\u201d. The recent statements by Malaysian royalty have shattered conventions and served to put Muhyiddin in check. Soon enough, the premier reversed his previous timeline to reconvene parliament and yielded to open the federal legislature in July instead. While constitutionally, it is the prime minister\u2019s prerogative to advise the King on when parliament ought to be reconvened, the assertions of the Malaysian royalty carry a certain gravitas that had the embattled prime minister defied it, he would have borne a colossal political cost. Repercussions for Muhyiddin PN has been more insecure than ever after the president of UMNO, the backbone of PN, announced the party\u2019s withdrawal of support for Muhyiddin and called for his resignation on 8 July. MPs within UMNO appear split on the Supreme Council decision and some may choose to continue supporting Muhyiddin along with other MPs not from the coalition. But with two seats in the 222-strong parliament vacant, only four UMNO lawmakers need to desert Muhyiddin for the current coalition to fall. UMNO has 38 MPs. Still, the premier may lead a minority government if no other candidate has majority support. Until recently, Muhyiddin had managed to leverage the fragmentation of Malaysia's Opposition and his coalition partner, UMNO, to his advantage. Despite navigating a global pandemic with a precarious government, Muhyiddin has so far managed to maintain power. Whether the weakened PM remains in office or he is replaced by a compromise candidate from UMNO or from the Opposition, Malaysian politics is likely to remain unstable and the King will be forced time and again to assert his position within the country\u2019s political life. The monarchy is expected to be apolitical, and the King is obliged to abide by the government\u2019s advice in executing most of his constitutional duties. Given that the prime minister\u2019s parliamentary majority in the past had always been clear, the King\u2019s role had largely been ceremonial. This is no longer the case. The King is being called upon by partisans to take their side, and by the public to return a modicum of stability to Malaysian politics. He walks a tightrope: he has to make political judgements, consider public sentiment and his brother rulers\u2019 views, and must make monumental decisions within the bounds of the constitution."

    "title": "Global Health Security: COVID-19 & Its Impacts Nationalism and Cosmopolitanism: A Post-Pandemic Balance?",
    "author(s)": "By Terri-Anne Teo",
    "date": "No. 096 \u2013 18 May 2020",
    "content": "IT IS opportune to consider what we envision as our guiding societal framework, whether in or beyond times of crisis. While the nation is an imagined political community, as Benedict Anderson puts it, nationalism has a historic role in constructing Singapore\u2019s identity through narratives of multiracialism and a shared past. This said, it is timely to look at how ideas of inclusion may be widened to encompass those who appear foreign, transient and unfamiliar. This pandemic has seen a global resurgence of racism and xenophobia, and Singapore is no exception. At the same time, reactions to COVID-19 include ground-up initiatives that signal a will to help those in need, within and beyond national borders. Nationalism and Cosmopolitanism To make sense of this discordance, it is useful to revisit notions of nationalism and cosmopolitanism as distinct yet complementary ways of thinking about inclusion. As we move forward, what forms of solidarity do we want to take with us, and what should we leave behind in order to build a better society? While nationalism as a concept and lived reality has contested definitions, it has at its core the binding of an 'us' through the creation of an \u2018Other\u2019. This demarcation between members and non-members may take the form of difference based on citizenship status, ethno-cultural and/or ideological perspectives. Hence, while nationalism has unifying potentials, this pandemic demonstrates the insidious side of nationalism. First, protectionist policies inhibit the export of medical supplies and other essential needs. This approach disrupts access to resources, free flowing exchanges and mobilities. Borders are fortified, with the export of protective medical equipment and travel restricted. These practices of economic nationalism, while understandably reactionary, undermine the need for cooperation in times of crisis. E.B. White, novelist and essayist, forewarned that nationalism presupposes local self-sufficiency, and entitlement based on belonging. The pandemic has pulled this curtain back. Signs point toward a renewed awareness of how interconnected and interdependent we are, with resources, knowledge and national economies contingent on the survival of the international community. Pandemic and Xenophobia Second, nationalism explains how the pandemic has exacerbated xenophobia and racism. In the context of pandemics, the connection between disease and foreignness is not new. US intellectual Susan Sontag points out that syphilis in the 15th century was termed the \u2018French pox\u2019 by the English, \u2018morbus Germanicus\u2019 by the Parisians, and the \u2018Chinese disease\u2019 by the Japanese. In today\u2019s context, this same logic manifests in exclusionary political rhetoric and racism towards individuals identified as Chinese, specifically because they were seen as a key vector of COVID-19. Such incidents affect those close to home, including Singaporean-Chinese migrants who endured COVID-19-related attacks in Australia and the United Kingdom. Unfortunately, these exclusionary sentiments are also present in Singapore. With the caveat that xenophobia and racism precede COVID-19, the pandemic triggered more Sinophobic sentiments in Singapore, with calls to ban travellers from China. More recently, transient migrant workers were critiqued for being responsible for the spread of COVID-19, particularly those of South Asian descent who are already subject to stigmas of poor hygiene and posing threats to public order. That nationalism is not necessarily divisive should be noted. Political scientist Yael Tamir argues that 'xenophobic nationalism [is] an expression of valuable ideas gone astray\u2019 and isolationist practices are far from the norm. Nationalism can be a salve in times of crisis, and there is perhaps no better time for national unity than the present. It is however necessary to acknowledge and remedy the toxic effects of nationalism on social cohesion. Moral Cosmopolitanism? Cosmopolitanism provides a foil to nationalism through the idea that all humans are members of a single community. Some proponents of economic cosmopolitanism advocate for a single global economy and limited state intervention. However, the mobilisation of grassroots aid efforts toward rectifying inequalities during this pandemic is not one that appears driven by economic logic. Instead, it speaks to moral cosmopolitanism, which calls for an ethical responsibility to extend concern for the individual beyond borders and to all of humanity. This ethos of moral cosmopolitanism resonates with efforts not motivated by an ethics of outcome but an ethics of right action. For moral cosmopolitans, decisions are made based on whether they are deemed right or wrong, regardless of their consequences. To illustrate, countries are providing resources and refuge for those stranded at sea, donations are made across borders to healthcare workers through personal protective equipment, and communities are rallying together to form support networks for the poor, differently-abled and marginalised, regardless of nationality. Unconditional Goodwill to Migrant Workers Aiding others beyond the national \u2018us\u2019 is also evident on a local level. Here, Singaporean citizens and residents are offering their homes to Malaysians affected by the lockdown, while coordinating food and clothing donations. When the government distributed Solidarity Payments to Singaporeans, donations were made to NGOs and charities, including those dedicated to migrant workers. There are also numerous ground-up initiatives seeking to ease the plight of migrant workers by raising funds, distributing essential needs and raising morale. Such moments of unconditional goodwill are promising, suggesting the need and potential for continuity. A duty of care forms the foundation of these movements. Beyond national bonds is a moral commitment to help those in need regardless of nationality, as a matter of justice and human rights. This rationality, and the acts they entail, counter the oft-held presumption that attachments to fellow citizens should be exclusive and privileged. A Key Language While a general ethos of moral cosmopolitanism can have positive effects on a community, it should not be treated as a replacement for nationalism. Where nationalism has its exclusionary properties, it is also necessary for social cohesion. As this crisis shows, moral cosmopolitanism and nationalism are not fundamentally opposed but are effectively two sides of a coin. More than ever, we are reminded of societal complexities as xenophobia is juxtaposed with acts of compassion toward migrants, and as nations both compete and cooperate for resources and knowledge to overcome this pandemic. Nationalism\u2019s collective spirit and cosmopolitanism\u2019s duty to others beyond our own should both be harnessed. Taking a balanced stance is particularly salient in Singapore, where economic and social progress hinges on both national solidarity and an openness to diversity. Developing a good society may well be the remedy for fractiousness and antagonisms whether in exceptional or unexceptional times. Looking forward, this period reinforces the necessity of leaving behind old habits of exclusivity and taking with us compassion toward strangers in our midst."

    "title": "Time for An ASEAN Digital Currency?",
    "author(s)": "By Dylan MH Loh",
    "date": "No. 185 \u2013 26 October 2020",
    "content": "CHINA MADE waves recently in financial circles when it trialled its Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) \u2013 a digital renminbi \u2013 across four cities in April 2020. The trial was expanded when the People\u2019s Bank of China announced that the city of Shenzhen will distribute RMB10 million (around S$2 million), for free, in a lottery system to residents, which they can spend the e-renminbi in selected merchants and in their city\u2019s metro system. The lottery was oversubscribed with two million registrants vying for 50,000 digital \u2018red packets\u2019, each worth 200 Chinese yuan. The Chinese experience catalysed a wave of discussions by central banks around the world \u2013 how best to harness and implement a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), and what good will it bring to the state? It is worth bearing in mind that CBDCs are not the sole remit of nation states as regional groupings are showing keen interest as well. Regional Interests & ASEAN Digital Currency? The European Union, for example, has accelerated its efforts into studying how a digital euro could be initiated and public consultations have taken place since 12 October this year. While the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) recently introduced a single currency (the eco), crypto-enthusiasts pointed out how this was a missed opportunity to digitalise the currency on blockchain technology. It is timely, then, for ASEAN to kickstart discussions on the possibility of a CDBC and how such an \u2018ASEAN Coin\u2019 might look like. The most obvious benefit of an ASEAN digital currency is that it would dramatically lower cross-border transactions and payments. Where a company would previously exchange currency to pay for cross-border goods or services, an ASEAN digital currency promises to cut out middleman costs for currency exchanges and make payments instantaneously. Plugged in with the latest developments in the sphere of \u2018decentralised finance\u2019 and \u2018smart contracts\u2019, it has the potential to be radically transformative. This would also be synergistic with existing ASEAN projects such as the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), ASEAN Investment Area (AIA) and the ASEAN Connectivity 2025 roadmap. An ASEAN Coin can certainly be catalytic to the emphasis on establishing ASEAN as a \u201csingle market and production base\u201d and having a \u201cfree and open investment regime\u201d. Second, a 2019 Bain report suggests that seven out of 10 Southeast Asians are underbanked or unbanked, having \u201cno access to credit cards or have no long-term savings product\u201d or \u201cwithout access to a basic bank account\u201d. An ASEAN digital currency can bring financial inclusion to the millions of unbanked and underbanked ASEAN citizens and small businesses. For example, a fisherman in Indonesia could theoretically be plugged into the ASEAN financial ecosystem with a smartphone \u2013 and do business directly with other ASEAN companies and end consumers - without holding a bank account. Promoting ASEAN Financial & Political Centrality Third, an ASEAN digital currency can help the bloc preserve its financial and political centrality. Given the maturity of the Chinese e-renminbi, it is only a matter of time before it gets rolled out nationally. When that happens, the next natural step is to blend the e-renminbi into its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and regional diplomatic efforts. It is reported that merchants in Seoul\u2019s Myeongdong District (which sees substantial Chinese tourists) are open to transacting in the e-renminbi. Given that Alipay and WeChat are already common payment options in much of Southeast Asia, it would be rather frictionless to transit into the e-Renminbi system. In any event, having an ASEAN CBDC could bolster the regional group\u2019s financial autonomy \u2013 ensuring that it does not have to rely on any major power for financial inclusion or be overly dependent on extra-mural forces for its fintech architecture. To be sure, ASEAN countries are already at various stages of developing their own CBDCs. Singapore and Thailand\u2019s experimentations with CBDCs are at a very mature stage and could see pilot implementations shortly. Other ASEAN countries such as the Philippines are considering introducing a CBDC. In that way, technical know-how and expert knowledge already exist at the ASEAN level to get things going. Vision of ASEAN Coin & Its Challenges Notwithstanding the potential for ASEAN countries to create an ASEAN Coin, there remain considerable challenges to realising this vision. First, digital infrastructures differ significantly. A few countries are substantially ahead of others in having robust and technically sound digital eco-systems. Singapore, for instance, ranks fourth worldwide in the global connectivity index and has a mobile penetration rate of around 150 per cent. This is far higher than Laos, which saw its mobile penetration rates reach only 54 per cent in 2017, while Internet penetration rates stood at 43 per cent in January 2020. Next, and perhaps the biggest challenge is to convince political leaders that an ASEAN digital currency do not necessarily have to entail a pooling of sovereignty nor having a single monetary system. An ASEAN wide digital currency could model itself after Facebook\u2019s Libra template \u2013 pegging it to a basket of ASEAN currencies \u2013 thus ensuring price stability and without the need for countries to give up their national currencies. The central banks of member states must then ensure that this ASEAN coin is liquid and easily exchangeable to respective national currencies. In any event, previous infrastructural, financial, and economic disparities have not prevented ASEAN from setting ambitious goals such as the realisation of an ASEAN Economic Community. Unintended Consequences As with any novel ideas, the prospects of unintended consequences remain. An ASEAN Coin, could, foreseeably throw the national monetary policies of ASEAN countries out of whack. Even so, adoption could take a staggered approach where it is trialled with selected ASEAN industries before being rolled out to other sectors. Implementation could also be fraught and questions over money laundering with such a regional currency must also be confronted. Nevertheless, the pandemic has shown in very stark terms how cookie-cutter solutions that have worked for so long, needs serious re-thinking. While it may be some way off before an ASEAN-wide digital currency becomes a reality, it is imperative that ASEAN member states start thinking about this possibility in a post-physical currency world. As various political actors around the globe advance their CBDC projects, the defining inequity of the near future may not be financial inequality but technological inequality. As such, conversations about an ASEAN currency, centered on financial inclusion with ASEAN know-how, should start now."

    "title": "Environment & the Singapore Story: What Next?",
    "author(s)": "By Choo Ruizhi",
    "date": "No. 053 \u2013 29 March 2021",
    "content": "ON 1 FEBRUARY 2021, the Singapore parliament formally declared climate change a global emergency, signalling the government\u2019s growing willingness to act on environmental issues of global consequence. Public awareness and civic activism have also dovetailed with the state\u2019s direction, as evidenced by recent outcries over the zoning of Dover Forest for residential use, and the accidental clearing of the Kranji woodland. Two decades earlier, in May 1997, then-Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong launched the National Education programme, an initiative aimed at instilling a sense of national identity amongst younger Singaporeans. Its central tenets were anchored in what is commonly known today as \u2018the Singapore Story\u2019, a national narrative developed around key episodes in the nation\u2019s past. The Singapore Story & Environmental History \u2018The Singapore Story\u2019 has since been regularly updated to reflect the country\u2019s evolving aspirations. The Story\u2019s most recent update was the Bicentennial Commemorations of 2019, charting the island\u2019s various transformations, from a geographically strategic seaport to a modern city-state. The \u2018Singapore Story\u2019 has thus come to reflect the city-state\u2019s changing perspectives and priorities. As PM Lee observed in 2019, \u201cwe should treat climate change defences like we treat the SAF \u2013 with utmost seriousness\u2026both the SAF and climate change defences are existential for Singapore. These are life and death matters\u201d. This being so, it is perhaps time to think more deeply about how this multi-faceted adversary fits into Singapore\u2019s Story. It is time for us to seriously consider Singapore\u2019s environmental history, and how the natural environment has influenced the making of this nation. History is not just about great men. While political histories may study how treaties and leaders affected empires, environmental history primarily explores how environmental factors (like plantations, pathogens or the climate) shaped civilisations. Environmental history thus also sits at the intersection of numerous disciplines like history, ecology, and economics, a quality which allows it to potentially yield fresh insights from even well-trodden topics. In Singaporean history, the environment has figured largely as a footnote: whether in mentions of our geographically \u201cstrategic location\u201d, or how land was reclaimed for industrialisation. Little has been said, however, about how these environmental factors interacted with Singaporean society. Environmental issues in Singapore, moreover, have largely been appreciated through the lenses of more contemporary disciplines. It is time historians join these conversations with their analytical toolkits, because we are emerging into a historical moment where the environmental is becoming exigent; existential. Singaporeans themselves have expressed a growing willingness to act. Surveys conducted in 2019 by the National Climate Change Secretariat indicate that a large majority of Singaporeans are willing to bear additional costs to reduce their carbon signature; over 95% supported Singapore\u2019s shift to a low-carbon economy. A deeper awareness of our historical relationships with nature will help Singaporeans better contextualise the sacrifices they may have to make, and to better navigate tomorrow\u2019s environmental emergencies. Why Environmental History is Useful Infusing environmental history into the Singapore Story can help to connect contemporary issues of environmental salience with the deeper Singaporean past. Deforestation, drought, food insecurity, floods \u2013 these modern issues have numerous historical precedents locally, reminding us that these things have happened, and can happen again."

    "title": "AI Governance in Military Affairs AI Ethical Principles: Implementing US Military\u2019s Framework",
    "author(s)": "By Megan Lamberth",
    "date": "No. 186 \u2013 28 October 2020",
    "content": "THE US DEFENCE Department is still in the early stages of determining how best to ensure the development and deployment of AI that is ethical, reliable, and secure. Earlier this year, the DoD formally adopted a set of AI ethical principles that are meant to guide the Department\u2019s development, adoption, and use of AI-enabled systems. The DoD, and in particular, the Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre (JAIC), is in the midst of transforming those principles into actionable guidance for DoD personnel. For the principles to be meaningful and enduring, the JAIC will need additional authority and resources; the DoD will also need to work hand-in-hand with allies and partners who are also tackling the challenge of ensuring safe, secure, and ethical AI. What can others learn from the US experience? Adopting and Implementing AI Principles Over the last two years, the DoD has taken a number of steps to lay the groundwork for AI adoption. In June 2018, the DoD established the JAIC to serve as the synchronising body for AI activities across the entire Department, including the military services. Eight months later, the DoD\u2019s first AI strategy called for the development of \u201cresilient, robust, reliable, and secure\u201d AI systems and vowed to articulate a set of principles to ensure AI capabilities were used in a \u201clawful and ethical manner\u201d. The task of formulating those ethical principles fell to the Defence Innovation Board (DIB), a federal advisory committee of tech experts and private industry leaders that counsel senior Defence Department leaders on emerging technology. The DIB released their proposed AI principles in October 2019, and three months later, the DOD formally adopted them. In short, the Defence Department vows to develop and deploy AI systems that are: 1. Responsible. Responsibility for the \u201cdevelopment, deployment, and use\u201d of AI- enabled systems rests with the human operator. 2. Equitable. The DoD will work to \u201cminimise unintended bias\u201d in its AI capabilities. 3. Traceable. DoD personnel involved in the lifecycle of an AI system will have an \u201cappropriate understanding\u201d of the technology, its development, and its operational use. 4. Reliable. The DoD will ensure its AI systems have \u201cexplicit, well-defined uses\u201d and that these systems will undergo testing and evaluation through its entire operational lifecycle. 5. Governable. AI systems will have the capability to \u201cdetect and avoid unintended consequences\u201d and \u201cdisengage or deactivate deployed systems that demonstrate unintended behavior.\u201d Signal to US Allies The adoption of these AI principles was a notable success for the Defence Department. The principles serve as a signal to private tech companies and US allies that the DoD cares not only about the adoption of new AI capabilities, but how those capabilities are used. The principles are broad and to a certain extent vague, but this was done intentionally. AI is an enabling technology with potential use cases across warfighting, command and control, logistics, maintenance, and more. The principles had to be broad enough to encompass future AI use, as well as AI applications that are already in widespread use throughout the Defence Department. As former director of the JAIC, Lt. General Shanahan explained: \u201cTech advances, tech evolves\u2026the last thing we wanted to do was put handcuffs on the department to say what we could and could not do.\u201d The JAIC\u2019s job now is to transform these principles into actionable guidance that is malleable enough to address a variety of applications, but concrete enough to facilitate meaningful action across the Department. The JAIC has launched two new initiatives that are working to develop frameworks for ethical AI and a \u201cshared vocabulary\u201d for all DoD personnel working on AI. The Responsible AI Subcommittee \u2014 part of the DoD\u2019s broader working group on AI \u2014 is an interdisciplinary group composed of DoD representatives working to establish the necessary ethical frameworks for the acquisition and implementation of AI. The Responsible AI Champions pilot, a programme designed to train DoD personnel on the importance of ethics in AI, is exploring how the Department\u2019s ethical principles can be actualised across the lifecycle of an AI system. Way Forward Despite these important strides, the JAIC still faces headwinds in its attempt to implement the Department\u2019s guidance on AI ethics. The JAIC\u2019s foremost challenge is reconciling the imbalance of its extensive mandate with its current level of authority and resources. As a RAND report from December 2019 found, the JAIC \u201cdoes not have directive or budget authorities, and that critically limits its ability to synchronise and coordinate DoD-wide AI activities to enact change\u201d. To fulfill its mission, the JAIC needs additional resources \u2014 both budgetary and personnel \u2014 and greater authority. While the JAIC\u2019s staff has steadily increased since its founding in 2018, it must continue growing in order to successfully manage the Department\u2019s integration of AI. The JAIC also needs its own acquisition authority to hasten the process of acquiring and testing new AI capabilities. A House version of the draft fiscal year 2021 National Defence Authorisation Act (NDAA) calls for this change in authorities. The same NDAA draft would move the JAIC up in the chain-of-command by placing it directly under the deputy secretary of defence, a necessary change that would give the JAIC increased visibility across the Department. Bringing in Like-Minded Countries In addition to increasing the JAIC\u2019s authorities and resources, the DoD should continue seeking buy-in and participation from allied and partner countries, many of whom are wrestling with similar challenges of incorporating ethics into AI development. The JAIC\u2019s partnership with Singapore\u2019s Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) is illustrative of the benefits of collaboration on AI development. Last year, the two countries held a multi-day series of exchanges centered on the use of AI for disaster and humanitarian relief. Earlier this year, the JAIC announced the first \u201cAI Partnership for Defence\u201d \u2014 an initiative aimed at bringing like-minded countries together to share best practices on incorporating ethics into AI systems. These kinds of partnerships are critical, particularly as the geostrategic competition between the US and China continues to evolve. Close collaborations, like the partnership between the JAIC and DSTA or the AI Partnership for Defence, allow for greater interoperability between militaries, access to global datasets, and the sharing of best practices to ensure the development and fielding of responsible AI. Ultimately, these partnerships will benefit the security of not only the US and allied countries in the Indo-Pacific region, but countries around the globe. Challenges Ahead The obstacles obstructing the process of implementation will not be resolved overnight. The Defence Department will continue to reckon with how to ensure the security and reliability of its AI systems as it continues to develop and field new capabilities. At the same time, as my colleague Martijn Rasser and I wrote earlier this year, the DoD will have to overcome the institutional and bureaucratic barriers that stifle its ability to adopt and widely deploy AI capabilities. The JAIC\u2019s mission for now is to make sure the Department\u2019s guidance on ethics and AI is clear and widely understood, so that DoD personnel from logistics to warfighting to intelligence know not only what ethical AI is, but how it should be applied."

    "title": "Human Rights: ASEAN\u2019s Changing Perspectives",
    "author(s)": "By Barry Desker",
    "date": "No. 174 \u2013 22 September 2020",
    "content": "ASEAN\u2019S VIEW on human rights is changing \u2500 as seen in the last ASEAN Foreign Ministers Meeting hosted virtually by Vietnam from 9-12 September 2020. This could be detected in the paragraphs of the joint communique discussing the crisis in Rakhine state in Myanmar. Human rights as an issue has drawn ASEAN attention especially since 2017 when 700,000 Muslim Rohingya fled from Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine state to Bangladesh after a brutal Myanmar military crackdown against the Rohingya allegedly following attacks by Rohingya insurgents. It represents the clearest case of a violation of human rights by an ASEAN country today. ASEAN\u2019s Evolving Position on Human Rights While the foreign ministers did not explicitly refer to the expulsion of the Rohingya population, they stressed the importance of \u201cMyanmar\u2019s commitment to ensure safety and security for all communities in Rakhine State as effectively as possible and facilitate the voluntary return of displaced persons in a safe, secure, and dignified manner\u201d. Indonesian foreign minister Retno Marsudi went further to urge Myanmar to resolve the root of the issue \u2500 the need for the safe, voluntary, dignified and sustainable repatriation of Rohingya refugees to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In its early years, ASEAN emphasised the sovereignty of states and voiced its commitment for non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of states. ASEAN\u2019s approach shifted with the adoption of the ASEAN Charter in Singapore in November 2007 which explicitly called on member states to act in \u201crespect for fundamental freedom, the promotion and protection of human rights, and the promotion of social justice\u201d. This led to the establishment of the ASEAN Inter-Governmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR) in Thailand in October 2009 and adoption of the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration in Cambodia in November 2012. The Declaration, however, did not satisfy some Western observers who felt that it fell short of existing human rights standards. Notwithstanding the ASEAN consensus on the inter-governmental nature of the Commission, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia appointed civil society activists and non-governmental organisation (NGO) leaders as their representatives. These representatives pushed for responses to voices from civil society, the participation of NGOs in AICHR meetings and outreach by AICHR to the global human rights community. On the other hand, there was strong resistance from Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia to moving from the promotion of human rights to active protection of human rights. While off the record exchanges occurred on issues such as the disappearance of prominent Laotian activist Sombath Somphone and the massive refugee crisis arising from the eviction of Rohingya from Rakhine in Myanmar, the affected states blocked formal discussions on such issues. Progress, Limits and Prospects Nevertheless, ASEAN moved beyond looking at human rights only through a foreign ministry lens. Dialogues have occurred on issues including the rights of women, children and persons with disabilities, trafficking in persons, the right to education, corporate social responsibility, and environmental protection. This led several Singapore civil society organisations to participate in AICHR events. The Singapore Council of Women\u2019s Organisations (SCWO), MARUAH (Working Group for an ASEAN Human Rights Mechanism) and MINDS (Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore) have so far been accredited by AICHR. The establishment of AICHR led to pressures to ratify or accede to the nine core UN Human Rights Instruments as the accession record of member states is discussed at AICHR meetings. Singapore is party to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD). It is ironic that Singapore has yet to accede to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) \u2500 a product of the Cold War that is long over. Early accession to ICESCR would reflect Singapore\u2019s emphasis on the need for a balanced approach to human rights which weighed individual rights against social obligations and the interests of the community. Singapore activists have drawn attention to Malaysia\u2019s handling of human rights issues, which they viewed positively. Despite Malaysia taking a high profile, especially on the rights of Palestinians and Rohingya refugees, it has moved even more slowly on accession to UN Human Rights Conventions. With at least 2.2 million documented foreign workers and another 3-4 million undocumented illegal workers, Malaysia, like Singapore, is unlikely to accede to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (ICRMW). This was an issue raised within the AICHR by the representatives of Indonesia and the Philippines, which are Malaysia\u2019s leading sources of migrant workers. More To Go A second example is Malaysia\u2019s lack of action on the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD). Although accession to ICERD was a campaign pledge of the Pakatan Harapan coalition, domestic pressure from Malays concerned that accession would undermine Malay special rights resulted in the cabinet reversing its position. The current Perikatan Nasional coalition is even more unlikely to change this decision. Cambodia has acceded to all the nine core instruments except for the ICRMW. However, it continues to be in the news for forced disappearances, arbitrary arrests and detention, allegations of torture and as a haven for child prostitution and child pornography. While Thailand has played an active role in widening and deepening coverage of human rights issues in AICHR, severe penalties for l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 offences and disappearances of junta critics remain the practice in Bangkok. The same is true of Indonesia, which has witnessed a decline in the protection of religious minorities including Shia, Ahmadiyya and Christians in the post-Suharto era as well as the torture, extra-judicial killings and forced disappearances of West Papuan dissidents. Similarly, while the Philippines has been a leading voice on civil and political rights issues in AICHR and the UN, there has been a sharp upward trend in summary executions of alleged drug dealers and criminals in the country. Human Rights in Pandemic Era The debate within ASEAN on human rights issues was also influenced by developments in the international geopolitical environment. With the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the collapse of the Soviet Union, Western values were in the ascendancy resulting in a culture-bound definition of human rights, which highlighted the personal rights and interests of the individual. This explained the criticisms of Western human rights groups of AICHR processes and ASEAN\u2019s commitment to universal human rights. At the same time, the 1980s and 1990s was also the era which witnessed the dramatic economic emergence of China, India, and states in East Asia. China\u2019s focus is on the broader interests of Chinese society through economic development, social cohesion, and political stability. The current generation of Chinese nationals appear strongly supportive of their political leadership and its efforts to shape the domestic and global environment. In this context, the current COVID-19 pandemic has raised pertinent questions about the balance between individual rights and community interests. Governments have been forced to restrict the activities of their citizens and to utilise technology for contact tracing. They have also imposed travel restrictions, required the use of masks in public places and placed limits on personal freedom through lockdowns. The US faced major difficulties in imposing these restrictions resulting in it having the worst pandemic outbreak globally. China, by contrast, which was the original source of the COVID-19 pandemic, effectively managed the outbreak by taking decisive action, after initially failing to control its spread. These developments will influence states in the East Asian region. The communitarian instincts of governments in East Asia will lead to a growing questioning of the current dominant international perspectives in the field of human rights. The measured approach taken by AICHR is likely to be closer to the new norm in the years ahead as the global balance shifts away from US unipolar dominance."

    "title": "Malaysian Chinese Federal Representation: Limited Prospects?",
    "author(s)": "By Nawaljeet Singh Rayar",
    "date": "No. 062 \u2013 16 April 2021",
    "content": "AFTER THE ousting of the Pakatan Harapan (PH) government in February 2020 and the resulting removal of the Democratic Action Party (DAP) from government, serious questions were revived on the role and vitality of Malaysia\u2019s Chinese-majority parties. The incumbent Perikatan Nasional (PN) government\u2019s component party, the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA), has but two seats in the Dewan Rakyat (Lower House of Parliament). Amidst a declared state of emergency, raging COVID-19 pandemic and rising Malay ethnonationalism, Malaysian Chinese risk their interests being sidelined altogether. How are they seeking political representation at the federal level? Demographic Dynamics Malaysian Chinese make up 22.6% of the country\u2019s 30 million citizens. According to the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) projections, Malaysia's annual population growth rate is expected to slow down by 2040. The proportion of ethnic Chinese is expected to shrink while the Bumiputra proportion to grow. The community has also seen significant emigration over the last few decades. According to DOSM estimates, the ethnic Chinese population will fall to an estimated 20% in 2040. This will likely lead to a reduction in the number of Chinese-majority seats during federal elections. At the 2013 general election, Chinese-majority seats accounted for 30 of the 220 seats, and 24 out of 222 in the 2018 election. These Chinese-majority seats are mostly in populous urban or semi-urban areas, where voters enjoy less representation due to malapportionment. Gerrymandering may further contribute to a lower number of Chinese-majority seats. Malaysian Chinese, despite being a polylithic group, have several common interests in federal politics that are not always race-driven. The business community prioritises the country\u2019s business and economic growth. Correspondingly, political stability and clean governance that allow for such growth is highly desired. Access to employment and resulting income levels are connected concerns that drive voter sentiment towards parties that espoused such policies. Certainly, there are communal concerns. Malaysian Chinese are affected by real and perceived affirmative action policies that privilege Bumiputras in various areas such as quotas for public sector employment, bank loans and public education institutions. Pakatan Harapan Government (2018-2020) Having received the support of about 90% Chinese voters and given its multiracial platform, PH had sought to make good on its campaign promises to reform race and religious relations after winning the 2018 general election. In September 2018, then Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad told the United Nations General Assembly that Malaysia would ratify the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD). This is a United Nations Convention that condemns discrimination and calls upon states to pursue a policy of eliminating racial discrimination in all its forms. In November, however, the PH government backpedalled on the pledge following backlash from groups who feared it could dilute privileges of the majority ethnic Malays. Following the initial euphoria of PH\u2019s electoral victory and the inclusion of non-Malays in prominent government positions, including the appointment of DAP secretary- general Lim Guan Eng as finance minister, disappointment began to set in among PH supporters. Lim\u2019s appointment was not perceived to have brought direct economic benefits to PH supporters. Many Chinese expressed outrage at the government\u2019s proposal to teach khat, or Jawi script writing, to Year Four students in Chinese and Tamil vernacular schools. Separately, Mahathir\u2019s participation at the Malay Dignity Congress organised by four public universities in October 2019 was slammed by non-Malay parliamentarians and society. Concerns and fear of further strengthening the so-called \u201cKetuanan Melayu\u201d (Malay supremacy) narrative were abuzz on social media. Malaysia\u2019s Electoral Model Owing to Malaysia\u2019s consociational model, its first-past-the-post system and the ethnic make-up of electoral seats, non-Bumiputra parties can only hope to be in government if they partner with parties that enjoy majority Malay support in a coalition. However, under the previous Barisan Nasional (BN) government, the MCA and Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC) were increasingly unable to secure support and seats from their respective bases. In contrast, DAP has received increased support since the 2008 general election; by 2018 it had secured 42 seats which made it the second largest party of the PH coalition. Yet, the DAP is seen to have provided few corresponding wins in policymaking for its Chinese voter base. For example, the PH government failed to deliver its pre-election promise to recognise Unified Examination Certificates (UEC) for admission to public institutions of higher learning. This was seen as a failure of DAP to address a longstanding grievance of the Chinese community. (The UEC is an examination certificate issued by Chinese independent high schools. It is an entrance examination to higher education institutes that is recognised by many universities across the globe, but not by Malaysian public universities.) The Chinese Dilemma While DAP espouses a multiracial agenda and fields non-Chinese candidates, its leadership and membership are mainly Chinese. For decades, it has criticised MCA and Gerakan \u2013 as component parties of the BN coalition \u2013 for failing to curb the Malay ethnocentric excesses of their main coalition partner, UMNO, and to advance Chinese and Malaysian interests. Once in government, however, DAP, found its hands tied. DAP and the Chinese community found themselves the target of a successful campaign by UMNO and Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS) to present PH as a Chinese- controlled project. Malay confidence in PH was undermined, and this helped to open the door for elements from PH to form the Malay-Muslim-based PN government with UMNO and PAS. DAP is portrayed as a liability for its coalition partners. DAP, however, reportedly continues to enjoy the support of the majority of the Chinese, even if a small portion may be open to returning to BN or sitting out the next election. Proponents of BN argue that Malaysia\u2019s ethnic Chinese should not put all their eggs in DAP\u2019s basket, because this could mean the community being locked out of federal government once again. However, this could be a hard sell if BN appears unwilling and/or unable to deliver the reforms that the Chinese seek, if it remains associated with poor governance and corruption and if it remains in partnership with PAS. Neither MCA nor Gerakan is expected to be able to represent Chinese interests in a PN- or BN-led government, given the low number of parliamentary seats each could plausibly win. On its part, DAP would have to convince its supporters to vote for it by showing that the party could do better in advancing Malaysian Chinese interests and broader Malaysian interests if given a second chance. At the same time, it would have to continue diversifying and expanding its voter base beyond just Malaysian Chinese voters \u2500 without alienating them."

    "title": "The Biden Presidency A Divided, Chaotic US: In Russia\u2019s Interest?",
    "author(s)": "By Christopher Cheang",
    "date": "No. 015 \u2013 27 January 2021",
    "content": "THE DEPTH of long-standing socio-political divisions and instability in the United States saw its zenith on 6 January 2021, with the storming of the US Capitol. These domestic divisions could lead to a distracted and unstable US; the conclusion one could reach would be that Russia would see this development as conducive to Moscow's security and strategic interests. The following factors belie this assumption. The election of Joseph Biden as president is not going to change Russia\u2019s perspective of the US. Domestic Factors In Russian eyes, the long-proclaimed status of the US as an exemplar of democracy has been questioned, especially since scenes of civil unrest in a number of US cities in 2020 became world news, including the then president Donald Trump\u2019s questioning of the outcome of the presidential election, and the storming of the US Capitol on 6 January 2021. They have only strengthened the critical stance of Russian officials towards the US as seen by the comments of Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova; she was quoted as saying that \u201cThe electoral system in the United States is archaic, it does not meet modern democratic standards\u201d. The head of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the State Duma, Leonid Slutsky, was quoted as saying that the US \u201ccannot now impose electoral standards on other countries and claim to be the world\u2019s \u2018beacon of democracy\u2019.\u201d In the last decade or more, the US has been perceived and portrayed as the greatest threat to Russia\u2019s stability and to some extent, even its existence as a sovereign and independent state. Should the US\u2019 current domestic challenges prove insurmountable and lead it to devote less attention and energy towards the outside world, the US would effectively cease to be Russia\u2019s \u201cmain opponent\u201d. Moreover, Russia\u2019s leaders would no longer be able to focus their people\u2019s attention on a powerful foreign adversary, which has helped to act as a unifying rallying force. Foreign Policy Factors In the current geopolitical constellation, the US and China are key to Russia\u2019s self- confidence and notions of a great power with global ambitions. Russia can relate only to these two world powers as equals while other countries, in the absence of strong military and/or economic power, are not seen in a similar fashion. Anti-Russian sentiments expected to rise in the US: The political unrest in the US and assumption to power of President Biden might lead to more intense anti-Russian sentiments, as the country seeks a foreign adversary to apportion blame for its internal problems. This assessment has been echoed by many Russian observers. President Vladimir Putin has been emphasising all these years that Russia is a conservative power, dedicated to preserving and maintaining stability, domestically and abroad. Hence, Russia has criticised US or Western efforts to pursue policies which it perceives as destabilising and which had led or could lead to regime change, including and especially in the former Soviet space and in Russia itself. China\u2019s rapid rise might be of concern: Now that stability in the US is seen as questionable, Russian leaders must be concerned about its long-term impact on Russia\u2019s foreign policy, especially with respect to China. It cannot be in Russia\u2019s interest to have struggled so long against perceived US plans to dominate it only to be possibly and indirectly dominated by China, whose geographical proximity and fast growth rates represent a more visceral and palpable challenge to Russia\u2019s notions of sovereignty and independence. Russia\u2019s ties with China today are stronger than with the US or other Western powers. Not only is China its largest trade partner, but major Chinese investments in Russia are focused not only on energy but increasingly in the tech sector. A recent report by scholars, Anastasia Muravyeva and Vasily Lemutov published in the Carnegie Moscow Centre presciently points out that \u201cChinese tech giants like Huawei and Alibaba, guided exclusively by market principles, are quietly incorporating Russia into a technological Pax Sinica, and Western sanctions are only speeding up that process.\u201d The report cites as examples the fact that Chinese smart phones have been the market leaders in Russia since 2015, and now account for nearly 60% of  market share, and that Lenovo dominates the Russian computer market, with over 23% of the laptop market in the first quarter of 2020. The report concludes that in the face of US-China tensions, private Chinese tech companies would play an important role in ensuring that Russia remains firmly on the Chinese side of the digital fence. Time Not on Russia\u2019s Side In the face of a distracted and unstable US, the window for Russia to remain relatively free of China\u2019s growing strength and influence, appears to be closing rapidly. China is expected to become the world\u2019s largest economy before the end of the decade, a Deutsche Welle report in late December 2020 quoted a new report by a UK think tank as saying. The Centre for Economics and Business Research said in its annual report that it expected \u201cthe US\u2019 share of global GDP to decline from 2021 onwards, and for the country to eventually be overtaken by China as the world's largest economy\u201d. This would take place in 2028, \u201cfive years sooner than in the previous edition of the WELT,\" referring to the think tank's World Economic League Table, which measures countries' economic performance. Despite consistently optimistic declaratory statements about the state of its relations with China, Russia cannot but be concerned should the US domestic situation take a turn for the worse and America sinks into chaos and becomes more inward-looking; Russia\u2019s concern would be mitigated should President Biden\u2019s policies lead to a completely different trajectory. The \u201closs\u201d of the US as its \u201cmain opponent\u201d could mean that in the long-term, China might come to occupy this position should the current stable relationship between the two countries undergo a sea change. Hence, Russia ironically requires a stable and powerful US to remain in the triangular geopolitical contest for global dominance and to balance China\u2019s inevitable and rapid rise to number one in the world. Russia would not want to face Chinese power on its own. Will the US under President Biden play ball?"

    "title": "Global Health Security COVID-19: Private Sector\u2019s Role in Times of Crisis",
    "author(s)": "By Christopher Chen",
    "date": "No. 051 \u2013 26 March 2020",
    "content": "WITH COVID-19 showing no signs of abating, the rapid spread of the disease is placing considerable strain on global systems and processes. As a result, populations are heavily scrutinising governmental efforts to manage the pandemic. With the severity and scale of the outbreak, dealing with this crisis requires the combined efforts of multiple stakeholders. The private sector can play a vital role in supporting the state to manage this outbreak. Private Sector Contributions Private sector involvement in humanitarian and health crises is not a new phenomenon. In the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, pharmaceutical company Pfizer provided US$10 million in financial aid and $25 million worth of medicine to relief organisations and affected populations. More recently, during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Western Africa, global businesses contributed $300 million to the global response. Indeed, the private sector has almost always been willing to provide in-kind and cash donations in times of crisis. However, the impact of COVID-19 is on a much larger scale as compared to previous outbreaks. It is not geographically isolated, with the disease spreading to 187 countries worldwide since the first case was reported in December last year. The scale and reach of the disease have created a global supply chain crisis, with many countries facing shortages in medical equipment such as surgical masks and ventilators. In this context, the private sector is stepping up efforts to manage the pandemic. Companies are repurposing their factories and leveraging on their comparative advantages and resources to help plug gaps in the medical supply chain. For instance, gaming hardware company Razer Inc. is devoting some of its manufacturing lines to produce surgical masks and will look to donate up to one million masks to healthcare professionals around the world. Luxury goods company LVMH recently announced that it would be converting some of its fragrance-production factories into hand-sanitiser plants. Longer-term solutions such as vaccines require more investment and time to develop. However, as the examples above demonstrate, private sector input can help meet the short-term needs of frontline health workers. It also demonstrates how all companies, not just those in the healthcare industry, are doing their part to address COVID-19 problems. Private Sector and New Technologies Philanthropic contributions aside, the private sector also offers a range of other functions that can be tapped on during a crisis. Some companies are leveraging on their technical expertise to provide solutions to the effects of COVID-19. For example, IBM refocused its 2020 Call for Code Challenge to solve problems stemming from the COVID-19 crisis. IBM will provide reference materials and technical resources to facilitate the creation of open-source technology solutions to address issues such as crisis communication and remote learning. This highlights how private sector interventions can help to generate innovative solutions in the fight against COVID-19. Furthermore, it is not only the big players who are getting involved. To address medical supply shortages, hospitals are turning to 3D-printing start-ups for assistance. Recently, in Italy, Isinnova, an additive manufacturing company, volunteered to reverse engineer and 3D-print ventilator valves for a hospital when its usual suppliers could not meet the overwhelming demand. This enabled the hospital - which was situated in Lombardy, one of the areas worst affected by COVID-19 in Italy - to have quick access to the valves. This was a cheap and fast solution to a potentially life-threatening problem. To put it in perspective, it usually takes three months for valve part deliveries; the Italian start-up sent 100 valves to the hospital within a day. Changing Social Norms and Organisational Cultures Apart from material contributions, companies can also shape the way people think about work. In order to \u2018flatten the curve\u2019 and control the spread of the virus, the general consensus is that social distancing measures work the best. What this means is that current social norms such as going to work sick and the 9-5 work cycle need to be reassessed. Companies can play their part by changing existing policies which incentivise employees to take minimal medical leave, while at the same time implementing flexible working arrangement plans. Policies such as allowing employees to take the day off without the need to obtain a medical certificate can also change the social norm of reporting to work sick. During this trying time, companies also have a moral obligation to support their employees. Several major multinational corporations are already offering unlimited paid sick leave to employees experiencing coronavirus symptoms or who have been quarantined. These efforts prevent the spread of the virus and maintain a degree of normalcy in people\u2019s lives. Public-Private Partnership The COVID-19 outbreak reveals many deficiencies in the current pandemic management system. From overstretched medical supply chains to severe economic disruptions, it warrants a rethink of how we should prepare for future outbreaks of this scale. In the process, it also highlights the importance of adopting a multi-stakeholder approach in future preparedness planning. To cope with future outbreaks, it is essential to strengthen public-private partnership in pandemic preparedness planning. Governments should include businesses - especially those that provide essential supplies such as medical equipment- in their crisis management plans. Companies and government bodies can also sign Memorandums of Understanding which guarantee stockpiles of specific items that can be quickly accessed in the event of an outbreak. The scale of the current pandemic has compelled private sector intervention in a wide range of areas. Just like governments, businesses have a vested interest in minimising the impact of COVID-19 on society. As such, it is a timely reminder that all sectors need to work together to ensure the robustness of the global system."

    "title": "Climate Change and Food Security Golden Rice: Triumph for Science",
    "author(s)": "By Paul Teng",
    "date": "No. 114 \u2013 27 July 2021",
    "content": "BIOTECHNOLOGY CROPS have been controversial in spite of overwhelming support for their safety by the scientific community. This is specially so for the class of biotechnology crops commonly called \u2018GMO\u2019 or genetically modified organism. The controversy has led to public concerns about their food safety, in spite of the fact that GMOs are only approved after years of intensive testing by independent government agencies, evaluation and approval upon satisfying stringent criteria for safety. This approval of Golden Rice and the lesser-known Bt eggplant are therefore milestones in the use of biotechnology to meet food security needs through more (nutritious) food with less pesticides. In the 29 countries which currently grow GMO- biotechnology crops in 2019, over 17 million farmers growing about 91 million hectares have been shown to benefit financially and health-wise. So has the environment from the reduced insecticide use. At the same time, worldwide, beyond the 29 growing countries, another 43 countries import GMO-biotechnology crops for food, feed and processing; this includes Singapore. Golden Rice: Addressing Vitamin A Deficiency The Philippines has a high incidence of Vitamin A Deficiency (VAD) which can lead to blindness and death, particularly among children. Rice is the staple in the Philippines, with many households consuming it two to three times a day. Almost 20 years ago, an international group tested the development of a rice variety which could provide enhanced levels of Vitamin A and therefore relief for the many malnourished children in developing countries. This enhanced Beta-carotene rice subsequently came to be called \u201cGolden Rice\u201d because of the yellow hue in the grains. The development and testing of this rice has gone through intensive scrutiny by scientific and regulatory bodies in several countries. Indeed this rice has been tested for safety and environmental concerns more than any other modern rice variety. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that over half a million children worldwide are affected by VAD, with disastrous impact. The International Rice Institute (IRRI) estimated that 17% of children under five in the Philippines suffer from VAD, so the Golden Rice has the potential to change the fight against this disease. Bt Eggplant: Engineered To Reduce Insecticide Use Eggplant (a.k.a. Aubergine) is one of the most widely consumed fruit vegetables in South and Southeast Asia. However, eggplant is highly susceptible to the fruit borer which severely damages the fruit that is sold through its feeding on the fleshy part of the fruit that is used by humans. To produce a crop that is cosmetically acceptable to consumers and profitable for farmers, almost all eggplant farmers have resorted to using insecticides. In Bangladesh, eggplant farmers have been known to spray as many as 70 times in a single season to ensure that their crop is saleable! Oftentimes the pest has also become immune to the cocktail of insecticides used. The alternative technology that was proposed in the early 2000\u2019s was to use biotechnology to give resistance to the fruit borer so that insecticide use could be reduced, farmers could produce a crop and consumers could buy a safer vegetable. Scientists engineered eggplant with a gene from a common soil bacterium called Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) and were able to show greatly increased resistance to the pest. This same bacterium in its raw form is used by organic farmers for pest control. The same Bt technology has also been successfully used in crops like maize, soybean and cotton. Indeed Bangladesh became the first country to grow this Bt eggplant in 2014 and since then some 34,000 small farmers have grown over 2,000 hectares in 2019; farmers have been less exposed to dangerous insecticides, and consumers have accepted this safer product. Other countries have been slow to adopt this technology because of the fear of controversy surrounding GMO-biotechnology crops and opposition by \u201cgreen groups\u201d. And it is to the credit of Filipino scientists and regulators that they have finally accepted the scientific evidence and shown courage to approve this new eggplant variety, and give consumers a safer vegetable. Future Biotechnologies The importance of the approval by the Philippines of Golden Rice and Bt Eggplant cannot be understated. The Philippines was the first Asian country in 2000 to approve a biotech crop, the Bt maize for planting by farmers. And since then the economic benefits to farmers, especially smallholder farmers have exceeded expectations, as studied by credible economists. It has drastically reduced the foreign exchange bill of importing maize to fuel the growing demand for animal feed. The Philippines was even able to export maize in one year. The doomsayers who predicted environmental disaster from introducing a biotech crop like Bt maize into the environment have been proven wrong as the fears of upsetting biodiversity have not been evidenced. Neither has any of the concerns about animal and human safety been seen. Indeed the 20 years of biotech maize use around the world has only seen a yearly increase in the uptake by farmers, to the benefit of consumers through a reliable supply of an important animal feed (and human food in some countries). Moving Forward The latest report on food insecurity by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in 2021 (http://www.fao.org/3/cb4474en/online/cb4474en.html) shows that the Asian continent is still rife with hunger and malnutrition. Many tools are needed to address the food needs in Asia, and the approvals by the Philippines last week augur well for the application of various biotechnologies to meet the challenges of producing more of both traditional food as well as novel food. Moving forward, the new generation of biotechnology applications to meet the demands of humanity for food, feed and fibre are exemplified by Plant Breeding Innovations such as gene editing. Their impact is just being felt in terms of crops with improved yield, tolerance to pests, diseases and climate change, and improved nutrition and extended shelf life. Likewise, biotechnology processes have been used in the fast-growing alternative protein industry to produce food like plant-based protein and cellular meat. However, whether these benefits will be realised will depend much on consumer acceptance and government approvals. At a time when food security worldwide is being threatened by disruptive forces like climate change and pandemics, technology has an important role to play in innovating solutions. Countries like Singapore are capitalising on some of these new technologies, not just to produce more food but also to address the environmental impact of food production. But ultimately, much will depend on a science-literate populace accepting food produced with new technologies."

    "title": "Global Health Security: COVID-19 & Its Impacts Pandemic Response: Role of the State",
    "author(s)": "By Luca Farrow",
    "date": "No. 115 \u2013 9 June 2020",
    "content": "THE IMPACT of the COVID-19 pandemic is being felt globally but we can focus on the situation in Singapore and in the United Kingdom to shine a light on some of the lessons that emerge from this crisis. Indeed, focusing on these two places makes good sense particularly given the UK\u2019s recent exit from the European Union (EU) and the championing by many Brexiteers of Singapore as a model for the UK to emulate in reshaping its economic identity. In his 3 February 2020 RSIS Commentary, Professor David Martin pointed out many of the flaws of the small government, low regulation \u201cSingapore-on-Thames\u201d vision for the post-Brexit UK advanced by many neo-Thatcherites. Not least among these is the fact that the Singapore government is a major stakeholder in the Singapore economy, including via the investments of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, GIC Private Limited and the shareholdings of state investor Temasek Holdings. Singapore and UK: Stark Contrast The Singapore government is not \u201csmall\u201d. It may have harnessed some of the efficiencies of the private market in delivering public goods to its population but it is not the stripped down laissez-faire model so hankered after by many economic right wingers in the UK. Indeed, in its implementation of quarantines, social distancing measures, the Circuit Breaker, and the Unity, Resilience, Solidarity and Fortitude Budgets, the COVID-19 crisis has reminded us of one thing about the Singapore government: that it is its ability to effectively intervene in the economy and to shape social norms that enables it to manage crises successfully. This depends not only on competent decision making but also on the prioritisation of the public sector. While the large number of COVID-19 infections among foreign workers living in dormitories has illuminated problems in the living conditions of migrant workers that the government has pledged to address, Singapore has managed to limit the spread and deadliness of the virus effectively. Testing has been carried out on a large scale from the beginning of the outbreak until now, community spread outside of dormitories has been very limited and government messaging to the public has been clear. Each of these successes have been absent in the UK. The British government\u2019s complacency and vague \u201cStay Alert\u201d public instruction have been roundly condemned. The government initially expressed interest in allowing at least 60 per cent of the population to contract COVID-19 in a wrongheaded attempt to develop \u201cherd immunity\u201d. It implemented social distancing measures and its lockdown weeks too late and after many had taken matters into their own hands and started self-isolating. The Horse Has Bolted In the three months between the virus outbreak and the UK lockdown, 18 million people arrived in the UK from overseas. Only in a few weeks has testing been carried out at a significant level. The stable door is being closed after the horse has well and truly bolted. The proportion of people recorded to have had COVID-19 in the densely populated island of Singapore is approximately 0.64%; in the UK, the equivalent figure stands at about 0.41%. However, in reality the infection rate in the UK is likely much larger than this. This is due to the fact that people with mild COVID-19 symptoms have not generally been tested but rather were instructed simply to stay at home without seeking medical attention so as not to overwhelm the National Health Service (NHS), the UK\u2019s public health system. Comparing the COVID-19 fatality rate in the two countries is a better measure of how the two governments have managed the crisis. In Singapore the fatality rate (the proportion of those recorded to have had COVID-19 who have died from it) stands at approximately 0.07%, while in the UK it stands at 14.2%. At the time of writing 24 people have died of COVID-19 in Singapore. In the UK, 181 NHS workers alone had succumbed to COVID-19 by 20 May. Prioritising Public Services Some have argued that the stark difference in success in fighting COVID-19 can be accounted for by the fact that certain societies value collective responsibility while others have been \u201cinfected\u201d with libertarian values, causing individuals to behave selfishly. While this seems overstated, and many individuals in Singapore as well as in the UK have failed to mask up and practise social distancing, there may be something to it. It is also undeniable that competent political leadership in Singapore and what many consider to be a lack thereof in the UK are key in explaining the respective success and failure in responding to the present crisis. But there is something else significant, which is the discrepancy in prioritisation of public services as between Singapore and the UK. Despite government spending on healthcare as a percentage of GDP being approximately three times as high as in Singapore, British healthcare outcomes are much worse. As with other British public services, the NHS has been variously neglected, mismanaged, and marketised. Exorbitant private finance initiative (PFI) costs have even forced NHS trusts to go bust and hospitals to close. The priority given to cutting costs helps to explain the dire shortage of personal protective equipment for frontline health workers during the COVID-19 outbreak. Timely Reminder A global recession is upon us, and Singapore and the UK will both be badly affected, as they were following the global financial crisis of 2007-2008. Back then the UK government was forced to step in to bail out the private sector in the form of \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d financial institutions. This time the private firms to be bailed out by the state will be of a much wider variety. The response of the Conservative Party to the global financial crisis was to pursue a policy of fiscal austerity, predominantly via severe cuts to government spending. But this time around, even economically right-wing think tanks have called upon the Conservative government to resist any pursuit of fiscal austerity. The COVID-19 emergency is certainly a reminder of the importance of strong political leadership but also of the dangers of marginalising the public sector in favour of privatisation for its own sake. The market cannot be relied upon to deliver optimal social and economic outcomes and this is shown most clearly during times of crisis."

    "title": "Najib\u2019s Conviction: What Does It Mean for Muhyiddin?",
    "author(s)": "By Prashant Waikar",
    "date": "No. 153 \u2013 5 August 2020",
    "content": "FORMER MALAYSIAN prime minister Najib Razak has been slapped with a 12-year jail sentence and an RM210 million (S$68 million) fine for abuse of power, money laundering, and criminal breach of trust. This first case relates to his involvement with the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) subsidiary, SRC International, from which Najib was charged with pocketing RM42 million (S$13.6 million). Since the Muhyiddin Yassin administration\u2019s slim majority \u2013 just four seats more than the opposition \u2013 there have been repeated suggestions that his premiership is shaky, subject to the whims of his biggest partner in government \u2013 UMNO. For some time now, UMNO leaders have been threatening to trigger a collapse of the Muhyiddin-led government, informally called Perikatan Nasional (PN), by withdrawing from it. With the conviction of Najib, will UMNO now abandon the government in displeasure? Misplaced Concerns; Split in UMNO Prior to the verdict, some observers, taking their cues from the Riza Aziz and Musa Aman cases, had suggested that the assortment of corruption charges levelled at Najib and other UMNO leaders might be rolled back as a form of appeasement. But Najib\u2019s conviction showed that the pre-trial concerns were misplaced. Disgruntled UMNO leaders may claim that they have sufficient clout to withdraw from the government. In truth, however, Muhyiddin has been gradually consolidating his position since coming to power in February. The outcome of Najib\u2019s first of five trials relating to the 1MDB scandal which has set back Muhyiddin\u2019s political opponents lends credence to this perspective. There is little doubt that Najib is a popular figure in UMNO. He has successfully recast his image since losing the 2018 general election \u2013 from being out-of-touch to \u201ca man of the people\u201d. Najib is also well-resourced and has maintained a base of support among UMNO division chiefs and some Supreme Council members. However, there exists a split among UMNO leaders and parliamentarians \u2013 especially where it relates to Najib. The clearest clues come from their reactions to the conviction. Reactions to Najib\u2019s Conviction After the sentencing, Minister of Science, Technology, and Innovation Khairy Jamaluddin issued a strong statement urging UMNO to move on from the Najib episode, rejuvenate itself, and not be dragged down by the scandal. Khairy has consistently been critical of Najib since the downfall of Barisan Nasional (BN) in 2018. More sympathetic have been the UMNO Youth Chief Asyraf Wajdi Dusuki, Pahang Menteri Besar (chief minister) Wan Rosdy Wan Ismail, and Foreign Affairs Minister Hishammuddin Hussein. At the same time, they were careful to acknowledge the legitimacy of the court\u2019s verdict. Prominent UMNO figures will generally not attack the judicial process now that they are part of the government. However, the cautious undertone of their statements is noteworthy. They may not wish to burn bridges with Najib just yet \u2013 especially if they can still benefit from his patronage. But theirs is hardly a ringing endorsement of the former PM either. Contrast this with the statement of another UMNO veteran, Mohd Puad Zarkashi, who attacked the court\u2019s ruling as an act of vengeance by Muhyiddin. Puad is an UMNO Supreme Council Member and Najib\u2019s close associate. UMNO figures such as Puad may be steadfast Najib loyalists. But expect many to take the trial\u2019s outcome as a cue to reconsider their factional interests. Muhyiddin\u2019s Premiership Still Secure? Splits in UMNO tend to reflect differences in position on key internal issues. Since Najib was a determining factor in UMNO\u2019s fall, the divisions reflect schisms on matters concerning leadership and the party\u2019s future. Some, such as Khairy, adopt obvious positions of strategic distancing, while others, such as Hishammuddin, are more subtle. Party President Ahmad Zahid Hamidi has firmly backed Najib. Responding to the conviction, Zahid has stated that UMNO will not join PN, but nevertheless will remain in government. PN is not a registered coalition, but a convenient shorthand to label the group of parties that have come together to topple the previous Pakatan Harapan government in March 2020. Most observers routinely overlook this. The question of joining or withdrawing from \u2018PN\u2019 is therefore moot. If anything, Zahid\u2019s statement reaffirms the status quo arrangement, for UMNO still wishes to be in government. It is quite unlikely that Zahid is in a position to unilaterally move the party one way or another. The outcome of the SRC International trial is drawing open the curtains that hide UMNO\u2019s factional politics. While enticing opposition MPs to crossover would strengthen the government\u2019s weak majority \u2013 just 113 MPs in a house of 222 support PN, Muhyiddin benefits as much from a divided UMNO. Those in UMNO who are furious with the verdict, fearful of receiving similar convictions, and sidelined from government positions may think the party should abandon PN. But those made ministers, deputy ministers, and government-linked companies (GLCs) chairmen would be unwilling to forgo their immediate interests. Prospects for Muhyiddin UMNO leaders who aspire to a political future beyond the current crop of bigwigs may be reluctant to acquiesce to the faction clamouring for a withdrawal from PN. The fact that PAS \u2500 UMNO\u2019s ally in the PN coalition \u2500 has been quite forthcoming with its commitments to Muhyiddin also diminishes the leverage that \u2018PN-exiters\u2019 may have. In the short term, Muhyiddin will look to maintain the status quo. His best option may be to create conditions which encourage parties from both sides to acquiesce to his remaining prime minister for the full term of this parliament until 2023. Since negotiating for seat allocations with UMNO and PAS is likely to remain tough, it is not in his interest to allow a dissolution of parliament. With over 30 years of experience in UMNO politics and government, Muhyiddin could be well placed to leverage the powers of incumbency, exploit UMNO\u2019s factionalism, and mitigate threats to his vulnerable position. Of course, Najib will spend the next year or more appealing the conviction. Should he succeed, Najib could move to reestablish himself in UMNO \u2013 leading to very different power dynamics in PN. However, Najib faces four more 1MDB-related trials, while his allies have their own court cases to deal with. With UMNO bogged down by these issues, Muhyiddin may have the upper hand for the foreseeable future."

    "author(s)": "By Loro Horta",
    "date": "No. 108 \u2013 2 June 2020",
    "content": "ON 21 MARCH 2020 Timor Leste reported its first case of COVID-19, a Dutch national arriving from Europe. Many expected the small Southeast Asian state to face a severe crisis and necessitate urgent international assistance. However, the young nation dealt with the crisis in a diligent manner far better than some Western nations who love lecturing it on good governance. While several Western nations close their borders only after having reported thousands of cases, the authorities in Dili closed Timor Leste\u2019s borders a week before the first case was ever reported, allowing only nationals and foreign residents to enter. On 8 April the country imposed a total lockdown and declared a state of emergency. As of 27 April Timor Leste reported 24 confirmed cases and not a single fatality. Hospitals handled the situation quite well while the police, the military and the civil protection services kept law and order and the populace calm. Rapid Growth of Health Service When Timor Leste gained its independence in May 2002 the country merely had 27 medical doctors and a few dozen nurses. Its entire medical facilities including hospitals had been destroyed by the retreating Indonesian army and militias. Timor Leste\u2019s first government under Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri made health and education top priorities. A national goal supported also by the country\u2019s founding president Xanana Gusmao, this unity allowed for coherent strategies to be developed. Starting in 2003 Timor Leste began to send hundreds of students for medical studies abroad, primarily to Cuba, which has a strong reputation in healthcare, but also to Australia, China, New Zealand and the Philippines. In 2011, with Cuban assistance, the country\u2019s medical school was created. By early 2019 Timor Leste had more than 1100 medical doctors \u2500 a ratio of one doctor per 1500 inhabitants. This is a ratio second only to Singapore in Southeast Asia. Despite American and, to a lesser extent, Australian pressure for Dili not to send its students to Cuba, Timor Leste remained firm in its decision. Hundreds of Cuban doctors have served in Timor Leste since 2003, giving a priceless contribution to the country\u2019s health service. While Timor Leste has on many occasions squandered hundreds of millions from its oil revenue in dubious projects, the massive spending on thousands of young Timorese abroad for higher education is paying off. Over 10,000 Timorese have graduated from universities around the world in several fields from Havana University to Harvard. This is a significant achievement for a nation of 1.2 million. This has allowed a pool of competent and young technocrats and administrators to emerge. Many like former prime minister and minister of health Dr Rui Maria de Araujo and Dr Sergio Lobo, have been at the forefront in responding to the pandemic. Hard Times Ahead While the young country has done a reasonable job at dealing with the pandemic, the crisis has also exposed many weaknesses. Timor Leste remains highly dependent on oil revenues. While statistics are contradictory, the most conservative put the country\u2019s dependence on oil at 75 percent of its GDP. The resulting collapse in oil prices following the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis has reduced the country\u2019s revenue by more than 60 percent. Several Timorese leaders have paid lip service to the need to diversify the economy and very little has been done. The agricultural sector has been badly neglected and food imports have increased every year while the tourism sector remains small. For the past three years the country has faced a political crisis that has seen early elections and constant changes of government. At a time when the country needs unity to face the uncertain future, its leaders are disunited. Following independence Timor Leste leaders wisely invested in the healthcare and education sectors. This was a national decision supported by all the country\u2019s leaders. This unity allowed the country to achieve some respectful results creating the basis for a successful response to the pandemic. Unity allowed the country to gain its independence, successfully negotiate its maritime borders with a sometimes bullying Australia and avoid state collapse. Unfortunately, in the past three years the country has witnessed a serious political crisis. With early elections, constant changes of government and abuse, the lack of unity among the various political parties remains. The achievements of the past 18 years will be very rapidly eroded. It is much easier and faster to destroy than to build."

    "title": "The Wuhan Virus Pandemic: What Next?",
    "author(s)": "By Mely Caballero-Anthony",
    "date": "No. 019 \u2013 31 January 2020",
    "content": "AS CHINA grapples with containing the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus, on a massive scale never seen before, the World Health Organisation (WHO) on 30 January 2020 declared the new coronavirus (nCoV) as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). As more updates about the outbreak come in, global concern heightens over the speed by which the number of infected persons is growing within and outside China. Since news reports came out about the health emergency from the nCoV in China\u2019s Wuhan city, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases has continued to rise rapidly. China: \u2018Complicated and Grave\u2019 The latest count puts the number of confirmed cases in China to more than 8,000 exceeding the number of confirmed cases globally during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis. The virus has also claimed 212 lives. Twenty countries and territories outside China have also reported confirmed cases of nCoV, with the United Arab Emirates and Finland recording their first cases. Chinese Premier Le Keqiang has described the situation as \u2018complicated and grave\u2019. Given Asia\u2019s recent history of SARS and MERS influenza pandemic, emerging diseases like nCoV pose a grave threat to health security in the region. A serious national health emergency can easily escalate into a global health crisis and can have wide-ranging consequences. Impact of nCoV The nCoV is a pneumonia-like illness; it is also like SARS that had killed 813 people and infected more than 8,000 globally. Unlike SARS, nCoV is reported to be less fatal, with a rate of 2.9% compared to SARS\u2019 9.6%. The nCoV, however, is highly infectious and has longer incubation period to up to 14 days. The leaps and bounds in reported confirmed cases in China are fuelling concerns that this new virus could be worse than previous pandemic outbreaks in the region. The Chinese government has pulled out all the stops in its efforts to aggressively contain the disease. It has ordered a lockdown of the city of Wuhan, the central source of the disease, and neighbouring cities in Hubei province, affecting more than 60 million people. The economic and financial impact of the crisis are already showing. International travel has been disrupted as international flights in and out of China have either been reduced or suspended. British Airways, Lufthansa, and United have just announced suspension of flights in and out of China. Business activities are also increasingly disrupted. IKEA has closed its stores in China indefinitely, asking its employees to stay home with paid leave, while Starbucks has also announced the closure of about half of its stores in China. Car manufacturers like Toyota, Hyundai and Ford have delayed re-opening their factories after the Lunar holidays. Meanwhile, Apple has already warned about the impact of the virus on its production while it reconsiders plans for its supply-chain. Health Security: Need for Stronger Global Cooperation It may be too early to assess the full impact of the nCoV on the global economic growth. China\u2019s GDP growth, however, could be worse hit by the Wuhan virus than SARS in 2003. An economist from the top government think tank, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, has estimated a one percentage point reduction in China\u2019s economic growth for Q1 2020 to around 5% or lower. Given China\u2019s size and interconnectedness to the global economy, the economic consequences can be amplified and wide-ranging. A 2017 study by the World Bank noted that the annual global cost of moderately severe to severe pandemics is roughly US$570 billion or 0.7% of global income. The WHO had similar estimates. The nCoV outbreak once again highlights the importance of pandemic preparedness and response, including sustained disease surveillance, reporting and control. It underscores the importance of having a clear and comprehensive public health emergency strategy which covers, among others, proper communication in managing public perceptions, fears and anxieties. More importantly, it also highlights the need to strengthen multilateral cooperation in health security at the regional and global levels to help affected countries contain the spread of the disease. Boosting Regional Cooperation in Health Security Higher population density and greater connectivity of urban centres make for the rapid spread of any pandemic outbreak. Thus, despite the aggressive containment measures undertaken by Chinese authorities, more proactive efforts in stepping up disease surveillance and control capacity at both national and regional levels are required. These involve, among others, boosting capacity for hospital preparedness, expanding laboratory facilities and manufacturing for vaccines. Since the SARS crisis, ASEAN countries have made progress in strengthening their capacity to fulfill the International Health Regulations (IHR) requirements. As parties to the IHR agreement, ASEAN countries are required to \u2018build their capacities to detect, assess and report public health events\u2019. Under the current circumstances, ASEAN members would need to go beyond capacity building at the national level; they also need to boost efforts at the regional level. Given the current uncertainties over the origin and transmission of nCoV, information-sharing and pooling of expertise at the regional level should now be pursued with even greater urgency. ASEAN\u2019s Role It is useful to note there are existing regional health frameworks that have been"

    "title": "Christian Far-Right: Copying Jihadist Extremism?",
    "author(s)": "By Amalina Abdul Nasir and V. Arianti",
    "date": "No. 045 \u2013 15 March 2021",
    "content": "IN JANUARY 2021, Singapore\u2019s Internal Security Department (ISD) arrested the youngest detainee under the Internal Security Act. Described by ISD as a Protestant Christian of Indian ethnicity, the 16-year-old Secondary 4 student was found to have made detailed plans and preparations to conduct terrorist attacks using a machete against Muslims at two mosques here. Despite ideological differences, such tactics are actually not new. They have also been observed on the part of Islamist militants in Indonesia. Hence mitigation efforts employed against Islamist militants in other Southeast Asian countries can likewise be used in the case of far-right militants as well. Copying Western Terrorists The Singaporean boy was self-radicalised and was particularly fascinated by the Christchurch White supremacist extremist attacker, Brenton Tarrant. He watched Tarrant\u2019s live-stream video of the terrorist attack on the two mosques in New Zealand and later read his manifesto. Inspired by Tarrant, he planned to launch a similar attack in Singapore on 15 March 2020, marking two years since the Christchurch carnage. He had chosen two mosques closest to his home as targets. The teenager also referred to a Triacetone Triperoxide (TATP) bomb making manual as he contemplated the idea of using bombs in his plan and intended to set the mosques on fire using gasoline \u2013 mirroring Tarrant\u2019s plan. In the same vein, such copycat attempts by another teenager had happened in Indonesia as early as 2016. The 17-year-old Indonesian Ivan Ahmadi Hasugian, who supported the militant group Islamic State (IS) that was based in Syria and Iraq, was inspired by the church attack in Northern France which took place a month prior. Two terrorists stabbed a priest in the chest and slashed his throat. Copying this tactic, Ivan attacked the priest with an axe after the bomb he carried in his backpack failed to explode. Similar to the Singaporean teenager, Ivan also consulted a bomb-making manual; written by the Indonesian IS fighter in Syria Bahrun Naim. In addition, both teenagers were obsessed with their extremist idols. The Singaporean teen planned to adorn a tactical vest with right-wing extremist symbols affixed to it similar to the ones worn by Tarrant. He planned to decorate it with the Black Sun and Celtic Cross symbols. Parallel to this, Ivan also had a note \u201cI Love Baghdadi\u201d, referring to the IS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, which he placed in the backpack that he carried during the attack. Procuring Weapons Online In addition, a common approach is also seen in logistical preparations for the attack. This includes online procurement of weapons. The Singaporean teen, like Tarrant, planned to use an assault rifle to attack. He found a prospective seller on Telegram but later did not follow through after suspecting it was a scam when the buyer sought payment in Bitcoin. Nevertheless, he persisted to seek other ways to get hold of a firearm. He only withdrew the idea when he realised that it was challenging to get one given Singapore\u2019s strict gun-control laws. Due to logistical difficulty, he decided to resort to knifing attacks. He later found his choice of machete on Carousell. Although he had not made the purchase yet, he had archived the page and intended to save up money to eventually buy it. There has in fact been a recurring trend in Indonesia with Islamist militants seeking to procure bomb-making ingredients and weapons online. Some Indonesian pro-IS militants have procured knives online such as Mulyadi and Abu Rara who conducted stabbing attacks in 2017 and 2019 respectively.  It is often a preferred method in Indonesia in order to circumvent detection from authorities. For example, in 2017, Young Farmer, another pro-IS militant who was previously deported from Singapore, upon returning to Indonesia, managed to buy hydrogen peroxide from an Indonesian e-commerce platform, Bukalapak. This took place after he failed to buy them direct from a chemical store in Bandung (West Java) as the store required him to present his identification card and a declaration for the procurement. This attack plot was foiled by the Indonesian police. In other instances, militants opt for offline payments to avoid any online traces of financial transactions. Dita Oepriarto, the mastermind of the Surabaya church bombings in May 2018, paid for the TATP bomb ingredients he ordered online by cash at a convenience store instead of bank transfers. This allowed him to evade detection from authorities. Mitigation Efforts Drawing lessons from the abovementioned cases, regional authorities may consider the following measures. First, as militants across ideologies may deploy similar modus operandi, each country should continue to monitor the modes of lone actor attacks by religiously-inspired extremists and far-right supremacists of all stripes, so as to keep abreast of evolving tactics. Authorities should also persist in tightening restrictions on possession of significant quantities of extremist material as these are strong indicators of radicalisation. For instance, the Malaysian authorities had arrested scores of individuals who possessed IS videos, images or paraphernalia. This type of enforcement should be extended to individuals possessing far-right extremist paraphernalia. Second, authorities can play a more active role in providing guidelines for e-commerce operators to detect suspicious transactions as the latter presently seem to have not imposed much restrictions nor requirement for the purchase of the materials that can be assembled into bombs. For example, presently, in Indonesia, the police mandate chemical stores to report individual purchases of large quantities of hazardous materials that can potentially be used to make bombs such as potassium and black powder. This measure should also be extended to online stores, including those selling certain types of knives, with stricter purchase requirements in place. Such mitigation efforts may not be bullet-proof, but policies need to be put in place and evolve according to developing trends and threats observed globally. In Singapore\u2019s context, these measures can complement the government\u2019s proposition for stricter law on guns, explosives, and weapons as recently tabled in Parliament."

    "title": "Global Trends 2040: A Hyperconnected Future?",
    "author(s)": "By Cung Vu",
    "date": "No. 061 \u2013 15 April 2021",
    "content": "THE GLOBAL Trends 2040 is the latest publication of the Global Trends (GT) series, published every four years since 1997 by the United States National Intelligence Council. It provides assessments of trends and uncertainties around the globe for the newly-elected administration to help them prepare for a possible future. The GT 2040 was built on two main principles: identifying and assessing broad forces that are shaping the future, and then exploring how people will respond to the forces. Demographics, Environment, Economics, and Technology were explored as the key forces; this only highlights the Technology aspect discussed in the GT 2040. Emerging Technologies Trends In essence during the next two decades the advancements of technology will enhance human capabilities to address issues such as aging, climate change, and economic but at the same time create tensions and disruptions within and between societies and states. Global competitions in knowledge, talent and markets will increase. The race for technological dominance intertwined with geopolitics is even fiercer between US and China. New technologies will emerge from different directions and at different timing. However, at the convergence of many unrelated technologies together with the increase in global competition will accelerate the emergence of cutting-edge technologies. For example, decades of basic research and development in electronics, antennas, materials, batteries, telecommunications networks, and user interfaces has enabled the development of the smart phone. By 2040 the convergence of artificial intelligence, materials, information technology, natural science as well as social science will enable breakthroughs with far-reaching implications. Time to develop emerging technologies is getting shorter and shorter from decades to years and sometimes faster. Transformative Technologies Even though it is difficult to predict emerging technologies but some fields such as artificial intelligence (AI), materials, biotechnology and information technology appear to offer the potential for transformative change in the coming decades. These fields are chosen to illustrate the potential benefits and risks of new technologies in the future. Artificial Intelligence Artificial intelligence will benefit all aspects of life from increased productivity, improved healthcare, better energy usage, increased agricultural crop yields and so on. AI will transform the way we live and work, creating new jobs, cutting others and it will drive significant economic and social redistributions. As AI requires massive data to operate efficiently, it will evolve personal data to be shared in order to access to applications, therefore as a result it will impact security and privacy. Authoritarian governments could exploit data to monitor and control their populations. AI could also be used to generate misinformation for economic or political purposes. AI is also being incorporated by a number of countries in their military warfare. AI will enhance the performance of weapons, defences, and security systems. Materials and Manufacturing By 2040, smart materials together with smart manufacturing will transform the processing conditions to the product performances, from civil to military applications in reducing costs, manufacturing time and reshape the supply chains while providing better performances and extended capabilities. Smart materials could be stronger and lighter, with better corrosion and thermal resistance, self-healing or shape memory and so on. Advances in information technology, internet-of-things and robotics will allow manufacturing by demand and respond in real time to changing conditions. Biotechnology By 2040 biotechnology will continue to improve quality of life with better food supply and source, better mitigate the climate change and environmental issues, reduce disease and fossil fuel dependence. In food security for instance, biotechnology has been utilised in various agricultural applications such as livestock management, improving crop yields, reducing crop loss, and reducing the use of fertilisers, herbicides and pesticides. Biotechnology has allowed to alter conventional crop rice and maize varieties to have higher vitamin A, iron and zinc content to reduce the diseases like blindness and anemia that are related to vitamin deficiencies. In livestock production, biotechnology has been used in reproduction, nutrition and production, and animal health. In aquaculture, biotechnology has enabled the identification and combination of fish and shellfish traits to increase productivity and improve quality, and development of natural products from marine organisms. Information technology and hyperconnectivity By 2040, we will have more devices, data and interactions, orders-of-magnitude from today, to connecting all different aspects of our life, across political and social boundaries. Privacy and anonymity may be gone by choice or government mandate since all our personal and professional activities are monitored by global networks. With the assistance of AI, misinformation could destabilise societies at magnitude and speed much worse than the current situation. Greater connectivity definitely increases the risk of cyberattack. Cyber security enforcement based on geographical borders is less relevant as the attack could come from anywhere around the globe. Broader Implications: Managing Technology Technology is neutral as it brings both benefits and generate risks. Therefore individuals, communities, and governments need to adjust and find ways to manage it. Technologies bring us benefits for examples the current COVID-19 vaccine development where technologies, integrated in new and imaginative ways, can be quickly reapplied from their original use to solve crisis needs. Technology has been used as geopolitical power. The United States has long led through years of investment in research, development and innovation. In the coming decades global technology competitions will be fierce and potentially could result in new technological leaders. As technologies bring potential benefits to society, not everyone could reap them equally. The gap between those who could access, exploit and adapt and those who are not able to is getting wider, exacerbating inequalities within societies and between states. As more and more corporations, either national and multinational, are developing new technologies that rivals or even surpasses some states, national interests such as protecting security could be in conflict with corporate interests in maximising profits and expanding global market share. A Hyperconnected Future: Boon or Bane? Technologies and hyperconnected future will enable governments new tools to monitor their populations to provide better service and security but also allow them to control or target individuals. Technologies can generate risks and it is upon us to imagine the potential impacts in scope and scale in order to develop strategies to minimise or manage it. It could be engineered pandemics, runaway AI or nuclear war. Even with very low probability, such high impact events are difficult to forecast; but identifying potential risks and developing mitigation strategies in advance could provide resilience to society."

    "content": "TRILATERAL TIES among Japan, South Korea (ROK) and the United States have been afflicted by a serious lack of cooperation in recent years. The strategic environment under which the US cornered its alliances to share defence costs, where regional threat perceptions diverged and trust between the ROK and Japan eroded, failed to nurture an appetite to work together. Historically, enthusiasm for trilateral cooperation has been strongest on the US side to create a prosperous and secure environment in Northeast Asia. It should be concerning that policy expert groups in Tokyo and Seoul have discussed the possibility of maintaining a business-like bilateral relationship, at best. Harvesting Low-Hanging Fruits A recent publication, \u201cReinvesting in US-Japan-Republic of Korea Strategic Relations: A Practical Trilateral Agenda,\u201d just released in February 2021 by the National Committee on American Foreign Policy (NCAFP), offers policy recommendations for trilateral cooperation. The NCAFP is a New York-based non-profit organisation dedicated to the resolution of conflicts that threaten US national interests. It takes into consideration the respective domestic constraints and regional interests, as well as the need to build a sustainable vision for the alliance. The overall tone of the document is deliberate and solemn, suggesting that the parties should: \u2022 Keep expectations low and focus on harvesting low hanging fruits; \u2022 Restore and maintain diplomatic engagement on multiple levels and incorporate a mixture of high- and low-profile efforts for sustainable cooperation results; \u2022 Pursue cooperation on regional and global issues in the short to medium term.

    "title": "Global Health Security COVID-19 and Its Impacts Vaccine Resilience: Next Stage in ASEAN\u2019s War?",
    "author(s)": "By Jose M.L. Montesclaros",
    "date": "No. 117 \u2013 2 August 2021",
    "content": "FOR MANY countries, the timing for re-opening borders and re-energising economies in the COVID-19 era depends crucially on fully vaccinating all (or at least two-thirds) their populations, to achieve a semblance of \u201cherd-immunity\u201d. The ASEAN region, with its population of 676 million, needs 1.35 billion doses for full inoculation (assuming two doses per person), and has secured commitments to deliver 939 million vaccine doses sufficient to fully vaccinate two-thirds of its population. The question of timing is relevant, however, when one considers that today, only 252 million doses have been successfully delivered based on the UNICEF\u2019s COVID-19 Vaccine Dashboard. This is sufficient for 126 million people, or less than a fifth (19%) of ASEAN population. Vaccine Hauling: Not ASEAN\u2019s Fight Adding salt to injury, the current COVID-19 situation in the region has been significantly worsening. Most regional countries are seeing their highest levels of active cases of COVID-19 (Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam) \u2013 perhaps too many for their healthcare capacity to handle. With further deaths impending, the need to draw more vaccines, to speed up the process towards \u201cherd-immunity\u201d for the region, was never more urgent. The obvious challenge is that there are global capacity limitations to vaccine supplies. Today, 4.2 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been manufactured and shipped globally, which means inoculating 2.1 billion people or about a quarter of world population (26%). Thus, vaccine supplies are still far off the mark of achieving \u201cherd- immunity\u201d at the global level. The ideal, for equitable vaccine access, is that all countries globally would have vaccines equivalent to the same share (26%) of their country\u2019s population. Compared to the ideal that ASEAN has vaccines sufficient to inoculate 26% of population, the region is doing poorly as its vaccine supplies are only enough for 19% of its population. Arguably, higher-income ASEAN countries like Singapore can secure vaccines faster, achieving 57% full vaccination. In contrast, for most ASEAN countries which are of either low- or middle-income status, hauling in more vaccines by bidding higher prices is not the kind of fight they can win. Intellectual Property Rights: A Fight No One Wins This reality check logically directs our attention away from the scramble to getting a bigger share of the pie, and towards the task of expanding vaccine availability. The state of play is that the scientific community has already achieved the stellar feat of discovering vaccines for such a novel pandemic, and getting the World Health Organisation\u2019s (WHO) approval, in less than two years. The baton has now been passed to the private sector to swiftly manufacture these vaccines. This \u201cbrick-and- mortar\u201d process of establishing new vaccine manufacturing plants or tailoring existing plants globally for this purpose, is supposed to be way simpler than scientific vaccine discovery. An apparent hurdle in this rally, lies in intellectual property rights. The World Trade Organisation\u2019s (WTO) Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement, requires countries to obtain licences from the vaccine developers before manufacturing their vaccines. Some countries (led by Brazil, South Africa and India) are pushing against this. They argue, temporarily lifting the application of TRIPS when it comes to approved COVID- 19 vaccines, will allow vaccines to be manufactured en masse across all countries. A similar option proposed, is if ASEAN states applied \u201ccompulsory licensing\u201d or mandated vaccine developers to give out licences to produce vaccines. This fight to skirt intellectual property rights, however, is one where no one really wins. This is because either lifting TRIPS or applying \u201ccompulsory licensing\u201d, will remove the \u201ccarrot\u201d or incentive for vaccine innovation and development. If pharmaceuticals find that they cannot reap the rewards of their earlier investments in COVID-19 vaccine development, then it makes less business sense for them to continue to invest in COVID-19 vaccines. In the long-run, this could debilitate the global community in adapting to the rapidly-evolving virus (case in point: the Delta variant today). From Contesting to Cooperating: Public-Private Partnership What evades the notice of most countries, is that it is possible to work with the system, and to treat private companies as partners rather than rivals. Patches of partnerships between local and international companies are already happening in the ASEAN region, within Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand. instance, Indonesia\u2019s Biopharma, largest state-owned For biopharmaceutical plant, is eyeing to produce 250 million doses of Sinovac\u2019s vaccines. Biontech is aiming to setup a Singapore plant to add \u201chundreds of millions\u201d to its regional manufacturing capacity, while Thailand\u2019s Siam Bioscience is partnering with AstraZeneca to produce 180 million doses a year. region\u2019s the These examples show that states can indeed work with the private sector in expanding the region\u2019s \u201cvaccine resilience\u201d, although this begs a further transformation in local policies and practices, and strong state backing. For instance, the Philippines previously had no prominent vaccine manufacturers, based on an earlier ASEAN baseline study. Today, local firm Glovax is partnering with Korea\u2019s EuBiologics to produce EuCorVac-19 vaccines. The Real Enemy: Time This would not have been possible, without state support by promising to buy 40 million vaccine doses, and in setting-up \u201cGreen Lanes\u201d to counteract red tape in securing permits/licences/authorisations. This feat required collaboration among state institutions governing health, investments and science/technology, led by its National Task Force Against COVID-19. trade/industry, food/drugs, While ideological debate on IP rights may be constructive, the real battle today in the war against COVID-19, is not between states and companies, but against time. The past year and half have shown that the pandemic waits for no one. The rest of the region would benefit from emulating the examples of Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand in providing strong state support to launch more effective counters to COVID-19, in partnership with the private sector."

    "content": "DESPITE THE sound and fury from political leaders in Washington and London opposing the February 2021 Myanmar military (Tatmadaw) coup, Western states have very limited leverage with Myanmar. After 25 years of cultivating access to the Myanmar leadership, including the military, ASEAN is better positioned to shape the international response to the Tatmadaw\u2019s takeover. ASEAN\u2019s Dilemma ASEAN itself faces a dilemma: Thailand and Vietnam, supported by Cambodia and Laos, have advocated for accepting the coup, in line with ASEAN\u2019s traditional focus on non-interference. Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore condemned the use of force against unarmed civilians and pointed to ASEAN member states\u2019 Charter commitments to act in \u2018respect for fundamental freedoms, the promotion and protection of human rights, and the promotion of social justice\u2019. Doing nothing is not an option. The challenge is to deliver a cohesive ASEAN response. At the special ASEAN summit in Jakarta on 24 April 2021, several ASEAN leaders did not refer to Min Aung Hliang as the head of the Myanmar State Administration Council. There were also references to major figures of the ousted regime, Win Myint as President and Aung San Suu Kyi as State Counsellor and Foreign Minister. For ASEAN, the convening of a summit to discuss the coup marked a shift in its handling of such events. Previously, ASEAN would have accepted the change of government, even if some members were unhappy with the developments that had taken place. Leaders' Five-Point Consensus The summit reached a five point consensus: an immediate cessation of violence and utmost restraint by all parties; constructive dialogue among all parties; a special envoy of the ASEAN chair to facilitate mediation; humanitarian assistance through the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance; and the special envoy to visit Myanmar to meet with all concerned parties. A sixth point on the release of political prisoners was moved to the Chairman\u2019s statement to avoid objections from Min Aung Hliang. Including it may have unravelled the consensus, given Min Aung Hliang\u2019s trenchant criticisms of Aung San Suu Kyi, the National League for Democracy (NLD) and the conduct of the elections which saw the NLD overwhelmingly returned to power. The UN Security Council has endorsed the ASEAN consensus. The UN Special Envoy for Myanmar Christine Schraner Burgener\u2019s requests to visit Myanmar were ignored by authorities until she turned up at the ASEAN summit and a meeting was arranged with Min Aung Hliang. The question now is how soon the Myanmar military authorities will permit a visit by the ASEAN special envoy. During the visit, the envoy should focus on securing an immediate cessation of violence, the release of some political prisoners, access to leading political prisoners and the implementation of the agreement on humanitarian assistance. But Myanmar authorities will try to delay a visit ostensibly because \u2018stability\u2019 and \u2018law and order\u2019 need to be restored. A visit by Brunei, the current chair of ASEAN, will likely take place sooner. Western Sanctions Western states have pressed for sanctions on trade, investment, military exchanges and the supply of military equipment to Myanmar. When Western states called for sanctions previously, they excluded their most significant investments in Myanmar, including oil and gas investments by Total (France), Chevron (United States) and Woodside (Australia). As Western investors are not significant players in other sectors of the Myanmar economy, their imposition of sanctions will not be taken seriously by the Tatmadaw. Myanmar\u2019s neighbours including China, India, Thailand and Bangladesh continue to trade with Myanmar, despite being unhappy with the coup. While Japanese and other Asian corporations have reduced or cut business ties with Myanmar military-linked corporations, their governments are unlikely to support Western calls for economic sanctions. Myanmar\u2019s two biggest military suppliers, China and Russia, maintain close ties with the Myanmar military and effectively blocked the inclusion of critical references and bans on arms sales in Security Council statements. Sanctions will only work if they are imposed by the UN Security Council. This will not happen as Myanmar is protected by the Chinese and Russian veto. Persuading the Myanmar Military Domestic resistance to the takeover or criticism from foreign governments and international civil society organisations will not deter the Myanmar military. It is an inbred military with limited access to external views and international trends. The Tatmadaw will implement its hard-line domestic policy aimed at rooting out critics and crushing its opponents, while hoping that the current international and regional criticism of its actions dies down. The Tatmadaw has given ASEAN a hearing as it has found the grouping useful for engaging with regional neighbours. But ASEAN\u2019s capacity to shape the Tatmadaw\u2019s policies is limited. It is a reminder that ASEAN is paying the price for including Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam between 1995 and 1999 without any conditions, following the end of the Cold War. ASEAN\u2019s challenges are compounded by the decision of the drafters of the 2007 ASEAN Charter not to adopt the far-sighted proposal by the Eminent Persons Group (EPG) for measures, including suspension, if member states seriously breach ASEAN commitments. Today, ASEAN\u2019s influence lies in its capacity to persuade the Myanmar military authorities, not in the presence of rules which may or may not be enforced. This will be a long game and a testing time for ASEAN."

    "title": "Global Health Security China\u2019s Medical Diplomacy: How to Turn a Black Swan White",
    "author(s)": "By Frederick Kliem",
    "date": "No. 061 \u2013 3 April 2020",
    "content": "ON 17 MARCH 2020, Serbian leader Aleksandar Vucic said that his people lost belief in the existence of European solidarity, which he called \u201ca fairy tale on paper\u201d. Only his \u201cfriend Xi Jinping\u201d and China could and would help to manage the COVID-19 crisis. As ironic as this is \u2013 it was ostensibly China where the now global health crisis started \u2013 Beijing is supporting in particular Europe and Africa to manage the pandemic. As a result, the COVID-19 crisis may turn out to be one of those black swan moments that change international relations. A Friend in Need After the first wave of COVID-19 infections subsided in Asia, attention turned to Europe where the outbreak is currently hitting EU members harder than it has ever hit most Asian countries. Italy and Spain are suffering in particular and became the world\u2019s second and third most affected countries after China. While Italy went into lock-down, spontaneous public outbreaks of community solidarity was something to hold on to. Intra-societal solidarity, however, was not at all matched by European solidarity. To the contrary, as soon as the crisis hit, EU members switched into unilateral nationalist gear. On EU-level, the otherwise non-negotiable \u201cfour freedoms\u201d (of goods, capital, services and people) were jettisoned immediately, as the border-less Schengen area was de facto abandoned. And when Rome asked its European \u201cfriends\u201d for help with medical equipment, other capitals went fully protectionist and decreed export bans on such goods, forsaking the EU single-market. It is remarkable how quickly lofty EU ideals and institutions unravel as soon as a crisis strikes the continent. It seems that Beijing has identified the global COVID-19 emergency as a unique opportunity to rectify its poor reputation in the world. Now that the situation appears to be under control domestically, Beijing is selling and donating medical supplies around the globe, in Europe, the US and Africa, and millions of facemasks and test-kits went to Italy alongside medical experts to support the devastated Italy. It helps a great deal that Chinese experts have SARS-CoV2 experience and much of the global medical supplies now most desperately needed around the world are produced in China. Beijing can simply order its manufactures to ramp-up production far beyond domestic needs and pandemic relief efforts become fairly low-cost. Soft-Power and Global Leadership In contrast to hard-power, soft-power is the ability of a state to shape the preferences of others through appeal and attraction rather than to coerce them to do what they may not do otherwise. While a risen China already has the largest economy in PPP terms and a growing military power, Beijing has lacked soft-power, especially in the West. The prominent professor Don Emmerson once said that we must invent an antonym to soft-power to describe China\u2019s global influence beyond economics and military power; repulsion rather than attraction is what he meant. The Chinese COVID-19 aid offensive is a chance for Beijing to reposition itself. And it can become a game-changer in the way China is perceived in this context: from the authoritarian regime that incubated a global epidemic to a responsible international stakeholder and provider of global goods at a moment of crisis. Meanwhile, China\u2019s peer-competitor in Washington is turning inward. Like many, President Trump has been caught off-guard and in the early stages of election-mode. Instead of assuming global leadership at a moment of crisis, Trump engaged in scapegoating, calling SARS-CoV2 the \u201cChina virus\u201d, and tried to acquire a German company working on a vaccine, to ensure exclusive US rights to the product. While President Trump is retreating into \u201cAmerica First\u201d, China is attempting to fill this crisis-leadership vacuum. Only a few months ago, amidst public discontent and outrage over the authoritarian disadvantage in handling such crises, COVID-19 seemed to become Xi Jinping\u2019s Watergate-moment. Now, the utter failure in Europe and the US to prevent community spread provides the Chinese leadership with an opportunity to change the narrative for good, to consolidate at home and rise to leadership status abroad. Swing of the Pendulum The large export-based EU economies had long prioritised trade with China over anything else. Lately, however, it seemed that the EU was heeding calls by its transatlantic partner to challenge China more on trade and good governance issues. The EU Commission for the first time called China a \u201csystemic rival\u201d and vowed to take a more robust stance towards Beijing. Beijing responded by seeking closer relations with EU members by, inter alia, including as many European countries as possible into Xi Jinping\u2019s signature Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Xi is also touting China\u2019s governance and trade model in contrast to the protectionist nationalist in the White House. Of course, a great majority of European leaders still prioritise their transatlantic over Eurasian relations. But China\u2019s skilful exploitation of the COVID-19 black-swan will certainly impact the mood among many Europeans, perhaps even swing it in some communities. While COVID-19 will not swing the political pendulum fully in China\u2019s favour, increases in relative soft-power vis-\u00e0-vis Washington and Brussels go a long way. Especially in the G-7 country Italy, the mood will certainly turn more favourable towards China at the expense of continental and transatlantic relations. Italy was the first major Western nation to sign up to the BRI and Beijing\u2019s help in this crisis will strengthen those voices that advocate closer China relations despite American pressure."

    "author(s)": "By Richard Borsuk",
    "date": "No. 026 \u2013 11 February 2021",
    "content": "IF INDONESIA has luck and performs better than it has in battling COVID-19, it could climb out of recession in the first quarter of 2021. The quicker the exit, the better as the country badly needs to get millions back to work and to generate new jobs. Some economists maintain that the world\u2019s fourth most populous nation, with 270 million people, needs six percent annual growth to create enough jobs. The last time that rate was achieved was 2011, when world commodity prices were strong. COVID- 19 brought Indonesia its first recession since 1998, the tumultuous year long-time leader Suharto fell from power. Unwelcome Shift For 2020, Southeast Asia\u2019s largest economy contracted 2.1 percent. On top of other damage, COVID-19 compounded the big employment challenges Indonesia faces. The coronavirus pandemic, in the words of the head of Indonesia\u2019s statistics bureau, has had an \u201cextraordinary impact\u201d on the labour market. Nearly a decade of progress in reducing the unemployment rate was wiped out by COVID-19 in 2020. Also, last year saw a change to the structure of the labour force, as the percentage of Indonesians in the informal sector \u2013 in work not providing a secure income, like street vending \u2013 shot up as factory jobs got axed. This shift is unwelcome because it means more people not on payrolls, and instead surviving on daily income, as opposed to getting a fixed wage plus at least some legal protection and benefits, like workers in the formal sector are entitled to. Furthermore, COVID-19 could well dent the prospects for Indonesia collecting what is called a \u201cdemographic dividend\u201d, when the number of people of working-age \u2013 in Indonesia that is defined as between 15 and 64 is much larger than the number that are younger or older. So there are more people working and supporting dependants not in the labour force. COVID-19 and Growing Joblessness However, COVID-19 jacked up the unemployment rate. The latest government statistics, covering until August 2020, put unemployment at 7.1 percent. That was the highest since 2011 and a significant rise from 4.9 percent six months earlier. Another finding of the latest survey was a sharp drop in working hours, as the proportion of full-time workers \u2013 defined as working 35 hours a week \u2013 fell to 63 percent from 71 percent in August 2019. The next set of official employment data, for surveys completed in February, will be released in May. The report on August 2020 employment showed a striking change as the labour force became less \u201cformal\u201d. For August, 60.5 percent of those working were in the informal sector, compared with 56 percent one year earlier. The number in the informal sector, and dependent on scratching up some kind of daily income to meet a family\u2019s daily needs, was five million higher than in August 2019. During COVID-19, President Joko Widodo has tried to help the poor in the informal sector by large outlays for a social safety net, and secondly avoiding full lockdowns of urban areas, which hurt people who cannot work from home. But that approach has limited COVID-19 mitigation efforts, and left the government relying on its vaccination campaign proceeding rapidly in spite of huge logistical challenges. Missing the Demographic Dividend? Indonesia did a population census in 2020 and the results, reported last month, support the theory that the country ought to get a demographic dividend \u2013 if not for the damage done by COVID-19. Nearly 71 percent of the population was between age 15 and 64, the highest in modern times. And the census showed how young the population is. A total of 28 percent were Gen- Z, born between 1997 and 2012, and 26% are labelled millennials, born between 1981 and 1996. But naturally a key question is how skilled are the big numbers of young people. Among foreign investors, it\u2019s often said that in Indonesia it\u2019s \u201chard to hire\u201d, given shortages of some skills, and \u201chard to fire\u201d because a past labour law allowed huge severance pay, now being scaled down under controversial new legislation called the \u201comnibus\u201d law. Job losses caused by COVID-19 have made it harder for Indonesia to reap a dividend from its demographics, as the job picture has deteriorated. Regarding the dividend, there is \u201ceither a window of opportunity or a door to disaster here,\u201d Indonesian Institute of Sciences researcher Nawawi told the Jakarta Post last month. While Indonesia has multiple digital \u201cunicorns\u201d and seen as great potential for investments in digitalisation, it also has tens of millions of younger people who got inadequate education and have few employable skills. Job Creation and Omnibus Law For job creation, the government places big hopes on the omnibus law to cut red-tape, attract investors (who have poured into Vietnam) and help small, informal businesses to get formalised and get access to capital. But the provisions have angered labour unions and environmentalists. Shinta Kamdani, deputy chairwoman of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, says the law is welcomed by small businesses \u201cas it makes it much simpler and much cheaper for them to be a formal business\u201d. For her, a big concern is how Indonesia\u2019s work force will get the skills needed to compete. The government has made many efforts, but \u201cmost of them so far have not shown significant changes to the skills-set problems\u201d. Shinta says education is key to solution, and the quickest way to improve is by \u201crevitalising the vocational and higher education institutions and incentivising companies to educate their employees\u201d. A World Bank report released in November noted that there were gains in education but a great deal of change is still needed. \u201cMost students do not meet the national learning targets Indonesia has set itself,\u201d the Bank said, adding that 70 percent \u201ccould not demonstrate basic literacy\u201d on the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018. Among its recommendations was giving all children a good start, with two years of quality and compulsory early childhood education so children \u201ccome to school ready to learn\u201d. \u201cGoing to school is not the same as learning,\u201d the World Bank commented."

    "title": "Ties with Israel: Indonesia Not Like Morocco",
    "author(s)": "By Syed Huzaifah Bin Othman Alkaff",
    "date": "No. 006 \u2013 12 January 2021",
    "content": "ON 10 December 2020, Morocco agreed to establish partial diplomatic relations with Israel and became the sixth Arab League member to recognise the Jewish state. Morocco \u2013 the fourth country in the latest diplomatic rapprochement after United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, and Sudan \u2013 had previously rejected any formal relations with Israel as it had previously supported the two-state solution as its official position. Morocco had been a strong supporter of the Palestinians. Based on the 2019-2020 Arab Opinion Index, 88% of surveyed Moroccans would oppose diplomatic recognition of Israel, and 70% viewed the Palestinian cause as the key concern for all Arabs. Additionally, Moroccan prime minister, Saad Dine El Otmani, a former foreign minister, described its pro-Palestine stance as \u201ca red line\u201d for Rabat. However, Morocco\u2019s recent agreement with Israel proved that this red line could be redrawn given the appropriate strategic benefits and diplomatic bargain. The Western Sahara Factor Apart from diplomatic relations and economic and cultural co-operation, the agreement also crucially includes US recognition of Morocco's claim over the disputed Western Sahara region. Morocco had been asserting its claim over Western Sahara for more than 40 years, experiencing protracted conflicts with the Polisario Front who claims to be the legitimate representative of the Sahrawi people in that region. The Polisario Front argues that the Sahrawis have a right to self-determination and established the ostensibly independent Sahrawi Arab Democratic State (SADR). In November 2020, the 29-year-long ceasefire between SADR and Morocco broke down. With its claim over Western Sahara recognised, Morocco stands to gain tremendously from its shift in foreign policy towards Israel. Western Sahara would provide Morocco with legitimate control over a large swathe of Atlantic coastline up to Mauritania that is also rich in natural resources including phosphate (a core resource in global food production) and shale gas. It is also believed that the area has significant offshore oil and gas reserves. Also, having this control would boost Morocco\u2019s position as an economic gateway for sub- Saharan countries all the way to Europe. The shift in foreign policy is welcomed by Moroccan nationalists as they recognise the security and economic gains and view it as a national win. Significantly some Islamists support the deal while those against are also split \u2500 some reject it based on their Islamist ideas about Israel while others reject the Western Saharan gain as they had viewed Western Sahara as part of Morocco all along. Beyond the significant territorial gain, the move also proves Morocco\u2019s willingness as a regional ally of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi. Indonesia\u2019s Considerations In contrast, for Indonesia, opening relations with Israel is out of the question for now as it remains a major foreign policy bugbear. While Indonesia values its relations with Saudi Arabia and the UAE, this is unlikely to be a key determinant in whether it would follow in the steps of its Sunni Arab partners. Rather, domestic political considerations weigh heavily on Indonesia\u2019s foreign policy considerations with nationalist and Islamist groups putting pressure on the government on domestic and foreign issues. Various calls to establish relations between Indonesia and Israel had been made since the Sukarno era. Most recently, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his intention to open diplomatic relations with Indonesia in 2018, stressing that Indonesia is an important country for Israel. Indonesian leaders \u2500 from Sukarno to Joko Widodo \u2500 had rejected these requests and had refused to consider diplomatic relations with Israel without full independence being granted for the Palestinian people. Unsurprisingly, Indonesian Islamist political parties and mass organisations support the government position and reject the establishment of diplomatic ties with Israel. Anti-Israel Sentiment Still Strong Both Indonesian nationalists and Islamists are firm and consistent supporters of Palestinian statehood and champion the right of the Palestinians to obtain independence. This stance extends to the political elite including members of the House of Representatives who view Israel as an occupying force. They legitimise their support for the Palestinians using the Preamble to the country\u2019s 1945 Constitution (Undang-Undang Dasar 1945). The constitution disavows colonialism as it is contrary to the principles of humanity and justice, while asserting that freedom is the right of all nations. As for the Indonesian Islamists, Israel is not only an illegitimate occupier of Palestinian land, but they are an enemy of Islam. In 2017, when President Trump declared Jerusalem as Israel's capital, protests and demonstrations by nationalists and Islamists erupted across the country showing their rejection of this declaration. The Indonesian government is acutely aware that a significant subset of the population holds these views on the Palestine issue and that their voices cannot be conveniently disregarded. Also, as a strong anti-colonial and nationalist outlook continues to shape how Indonesians perceive Israel\u2019s treatment of Palestinians especially in the national parliament, their views must be taken seriously before diplomatic ties can be established. The Balance Sheet For Indonesia, any ties with Israel, even against the backdrop of US diplomatic intervention, would likely require a deal that would grant strategic political, economic or military advantage which would not only appease nationalists but also be worth the trouble with Islamist groups. Indeed, cooperation with the US and Israel could likely derive multiple benefits for Indonesia, especially in the military, economic, and technological aspects. While Indonesia\u2019s economy has long been dependent on the US market, Jakarta\u2019s more recent reliance on China \u2500 it is Indonesia\u2019s major import and export partner for the non-oil and gas sector \u2500 could do with greater diversification. The Indonesian Air Force is aiming to upgrade its primary weapons defence system (Alutsista) especially their jet fighters, radars and missiles by 2024. Further, as Indonesia may not be able to prevent Chinese incursions in the Natuna Sea, Jakarta may need to strengthen its military relationship with the US to fend off Chinese intrusions. Indonesia could also potentially benefit from contributions to and exchanges in the agricultural, dairy, medical, and energy sectors. However, whatever Indonesia stands to gain must outweigh or at least address possible violent counter pressures from its population. Domestic radical Islamist elements will feature strongly in Indonesia\u2019s decision-making processes on issues pertaining to relations with Israel. Anti-Israeli sentiments are also shared by many Indonesian leaders and anti-Israel sentiment has been strongest among radical Islamist groups and from those who similarly believe that Israel, or more precisely Zionism, is the sworn enemy of the Islamic community."

    "title": "Putin After 2024: More Power or More Predictability?",
    "author(s)": "By Chris Cheang",
    "date": "No. 026 \u2013 14 February 2020",
    "content": "ALTHOUGH HIS overall popularity remains high, support for President Vladimir Putin in the last few years and months has declined, thanks to the state of the economy and falling living standards. Russia\u2019s economy has not been growing fast enough. In 2019, growth was at 1.3%; in 2020, it is projected to be 1.8%. Structural challenges, a conservative policy of macro-economic stability as well as Western sanctions have acted as brakes on higher growth rates. The resultant politico-social unrest, seen in 2018 and 2019, has stimulated Putin\u2019s need to act fast on the political front. It is in this context that his recent constitutional proposals should be seen. They were not only to arrest the decline in his popularity but more so to introduce stability and especially, predictability into the post-Putin era and with that, secure his legacy for posterity. Planning for Political Changes In a nutshell, his proposals call for granting more power to the Duma and the State Council (currently an advisory body) and introducing a two-term presidency. They also include the need for Russian law to prevail over international law and treaties and finally, to limit high political and civil service offices to Russian citizens only who do not have permanent residency or another citizenship. The Duma expectedly approved the proposals in a first reading a week after his speech; no opposition is expected from the Upper House as well. However, Putin has made it plain that the proposals must be approved in a national vote before he appends his signature to the proposals. It is noteworthy that they were submitted long before the September 2021 Duma elections. Dominated by the pro-government and pro-Putin United Russia (UR), which faces loyal opposition from the Communist Party, the Liberal Democratic party and Just Russia party, President Putin cannot assume that this political constellation will hold after September 2021, in the light of social and political discontent with UR. Hence, the proposals can be seen as an attempt to address the concerns and dissatisfaction of growing numbers of the electorate with the perceived lack of political discourse and freedom. Widespread Apathy The absence of mass demonstrations against the proposals suggests that there is likely to be no serious street or \u201cnon-systemic opposition\u201d, meaning political forces outside the parliamentary system. Thus far, the only sign of a planned protest by the non-systemic opposition is a scheduled demonstration at the end of February, to mark the fifth anniversary of the killing of Boris Nemtsov, a liberal politician. Expressions of opposition to the proposals are expected at this planned event. Political apathy and largely disillusionment with the absence of real change after past demonstrations only partly explain this phenomenon. Of note is the fact that the youth of Russia today have known only Putin as president and have grown up under relatively prosperous and stable circumstances, unlike their parents and grandparents. It is therefore not a surprise that a recent survey by VTSIOM, a state pollster, revealed that a majority of respondents (79%) consider the proposals \u201crather important\u201d. New PM\u2019s Key Task About half the members of the Cabinet is from the previous government; the new members are younger technocratic experience and qualifications as well as administrative skills. The new prime minister Mikhail Mishutin is known as a capable technocrat who established a well-run tax service. individuals with proven The overriding task of his government is to fully and successfully implement the National Projects (NPs), Putin\u2019s ambitious US$400 billion programme to stimulate the economy and in the process, raise living standards. Former prime minister Dmitry Medvedev was seen to have failed to implement the NPs fast enough. Accomplishment of these objectives would cement Putin\u2019s legacy as post-Soviet Russia\u2019s longest-serving president. He would be seen as the leader who brought stability and prosperity after the chaos in the aftermath of the USSR\u2019s collapse and who laid the foundation of a stronger economy in a stable and predictable political system after 2024. Announced in May 2018 by him, the NPs are to be implemented by the end of his term of office in 2024. Veteran foreign minister Sergei Lavrov retained his post, a clear sign that there would be continuity in foreign policy. Probable Successor Mishutin was chosen by Putin to be prime minister in a very calculated move and is his probable successor for the following reasons: First, he has the technocratic credentials to fully and successfully implement the NPs as well as raise the economic growth rates; so do the new and current members of his Cabinet. His fluency in the English language could not but be noticed by Putin. Such a facility would mean easier access and direct communication with the United States, regarded as the most important country (despite oft-repeated protestations of close and vital links with China) and \u201cmain opponent\u201d of Russia. Second, Mishutin does not have any known links to Russia\u2019s powerful interest groups such as the siloviki or top security establishment officials and heads of powerful state corporations. Hence, Putin need not balance the interests of these groups; were he a member of either of them, Putin would have to spend political capital and time on such a task. Moreover, Mishutin would not be seen as \u201cold wine in a new bottle\u201d by the electorate. In this regard, he fits the bill of having new faces at the helm of power. Fourth, being a political unknown without any expressed political ambitions, he is not considered a threat by either Putin or the powerful interest groups. In that regard, Putin would be more at ease handing over power to Mishutin. Elder Statesman? Earlier speculation that Putin might assume the leadership of a restructured State Council with extensive powers has thus far proved groundless. Nevertheless, it is quite certain that he does not intend to remain in office till his death, as had been the case in the Soviet era. He made this clear to World War II veterans in St Petersburg just three days after his State-of-the-Nation speech in which he outlined his constitutional proposals. A few days later, he pointed out that a role like that of the late Minister Mentor, Lee Kuan Yew, \u201cis not applicable to Russia\u201d as it \u201cwould undermine the institution of the presidency,\u201d insisting that Russia must remain a \u201cstrong presidential republic\u201d. Latest media reports that a government commission has proposed the title of \u201cSupreme Leader\u201d for the position of head of state, have further added to all the speculation about his political future after 2024. His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov was reported to have said that the president had no view on the proposal. There is, nevertheless, no doubt that he would assume a role after he steps down from power. Only the form, structure and extent of that role\u2019s powers remain to be seen."

    "author(s)": "By Deep Datta-Ray",
    "date": "No. 213 \u2013 28 December 2020",
    "content": "WITHIN A month of the first case of COVID-19 in March this year, Estonia had over a thousand cases. A state of emergency was declared and borders were closed, yet disruption was reduced because of Estonia\u2019s digital capacity and capability. Both helped stabilise infection rates which eventually led to the easing of the lockdown and creation of a Baltic \u201ctravel bubble\u201d in May. Despite a second wave of infections across the continent, measures to control COVID- 19\u2019s spread in Estonia proved effective. This month Fitch, a major credit rating agency, revised downwards the contraction of the Estonian economy from 4.9 percent to 2.9 percent. Fitch forecasts robust recovery in 2021. Navigating \u2018New Normal\u2019: First-Mover Advantage The challenges of navigating the \u201cnew normal\u201d are met by a strategy of increased digitalisation and more international cooperation, particularly with the other small states around the world. Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, remains entrenched in the European Union while maintaining close ties with the United States. These decisions are helping to cushion the effects of post-globalisation. Estonians believe their government has insulated them from the economic downturn brought on by COVID-19, and from potential threats arising from their powerful neighbour, Russia. At the same time, Estonians feel vulnerable to the intense geopolitical rivalry and competition between the US and China, and the EU still finding its footing. Estonia\u2019s digital advantage is due to its early embrace of IT since the mid-1990s. By 2002 Internet access was deemed a human right, but digitalisation became extensive with the digital ID. Usable across the public and private sectors, the ID is for both public and private use. For instance, the ID could be a driver\u2019s licence and an access card for a private, paid, gym membership. The private sector is an active participant in making the digital ID of practical value to Estonians. Estonia was also confident about digital security at COVID-19\u2019s onset. In last year\u2019s elections, 43.8 per cent of the vote was electronic. Training in online safety was widespread and 87 per cent of schools were using e-learning by 2020. Financial transactions too, were largely online. Since 2009, pensions and social benefits have only been paid electronically and 96 per cent of income tax declarations are online. The security measures in place and the population\u2019s familiarity with them is why the incidence of online crime went up only marginally during the pandemic. The lockdown was therefore transitioned into rather seamlessly. For example, Estonia\u2019s University of Tartu switched to online teaching overnight. Already-in-place online health records and e-prescriptions allowed doctor\u2019s quick redeployment to manage the pandemic. Infections were also reduced by the widespread availability of contactless options. This extends to border crossings. Countering the Pandemic The existing system facilitated quick implementation of new policies to counter the pandemic, such as minimal punitive actions on tax arrears. The tamper-proofing of IT systems enabled the labour laws to be updated despite their complexity arising from many more inputs required to make the system reliable in times of pandemic. Even though this so-called digital inheritance dampened concerns about data security and permitted the rollout of the contact-tracing app HOIA, the government constantly assesses its technology and vulnerable points. Hence, the University of Tartu\u2019s funding was topped up with 880,000 euros in November to extend studies of the efficacy of the government\u2019s emergency measures with the goal of an orderly exit from the emergency situation. That remains contingent on managing global infection rates, for the opening of borders is inevitable. Hence Estonia\u2019s conception of the \u201cnew normal\u201d is to build on its first- mover advantage, with its acknowledged successes, and to promote more international cooperation on digitalisation. Reiterating the need is the rapid uptick in infection cases and deaths since the onset of autumn, despite earlier successes in pandemic containment. Estonia hosted an online ministerial conference on digitisation in July which was attended by more than 60 countries, and is currently co-sponsoring with Singapore, a global declaration arising from the meeting titled, \u201cClose the Digital Divides: the Digital Response to COVID-19\u201d. The declaration prioritises international cooperation to re-focus resources for a digital transformation. This includes reinforcing digital capabilities for health care as well as e-commerce, implementing e-education and improving digital literacy, and ensuring secure digital spaces while broad-based connectivity and e-governance are embedded. The co-chair of the Group of Friends on e-Governance and Cybersecurity at the United Nations (UN), Singapore\u2019s Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, explained the declaration intends to empower people against COVID-19 by allowing safe access to services, and to reopen borders by, for instance, speeding up contact tracing. Moreover, the \u201cdigital future\u201d rides on international cooperation to build resilient and trusted networks within the UN framework. Cushioning Post-Globalisation Threats Post-globalisation for Estonia sees a dangerous intensification of disagreements between its closest allies, the EU and US, as well as of threats from China and Russia to Tallinn\u2019s sovereignty and strategic autonomy. Estonia is managing these by committing to the \u201cfundamental interest of small states to defend multilateral cooperation and a rules-based order\u201d. Tallinn therefore is increasing trade and digital cooperation with more small states. For example, Estonia and the United Arab Emirates recently agreed to recognise each other\u2019s driving licences, which are now issued digitally. The EU is Estonia\u2019s bedrock for negotiating the post-globalisation landscape. Tallinn demonstrated its commitment to the EU by doubling down on the EU\u2019s climate change targets. The EU welcomed Tallinn\u2019s pandemic management and cited it as an example for emulation to other EU countries. The US remains a close ally and cooperation now extends to increasingly sensitive matters of online security. Prior to November\u2019s US presidential election, US Cyber Command operatives visited Tallinn to observe Russian hackers attacking Estonian IT systems, and be trained to counter them. Looking Ahead The pandemic is buffeting EU-US relations, in particular, on resuming business and travel; working with the World Health Organisation (WHO) on vaccine development and distribution; and on blaming China for originating COVID-19. Estonia sought, in vain, to ameliorate disagreements between allies on combatting the infection. Tallinn therefore seeks a closer alliance with the EU and US to help mitigate threats from China and Russia. Apart from territorial disagreements between Estonia and Russia, Moscow is likely also responsible for several cyber-attacks and disinformation campaigns. The massive hacking of the Baltic state's parliamentary, government, and banking systems in 2007 left an indelible mark on Estonian psyche. Tallinn was drawn into Sino-US rivalry, when it signed a memorandum with the US on strengthening digital cooperation and restricting products the Chinese manufacturer Huawei. This year, the Estonian Foreign Intelligence Service observed, \u201cit is important to understand in the eyes of the Communist Party of China (CPC), decision-makers in other countries are only useful pawns to help implement CPC strategies\u201d. Beijing\u2019s calls to have the report amended were met by Tallinn calling for more unity within the EU. from Estonia\u2019s digitalisation strategy enabled it to weather the pandemic. Nevertheless, the global milieu remains uncertain. Similarly, the cyber domain is fluid, as technologies constantly evolve, and international norms and regulations remain unsettled. In short, small states remain vulnerable."

    "title": "Global Health Security: COVID-19 & Its Impacts Indonesia\u2019s Regional Elections: Entering Uncharted Waters?",
    "author(s)": "By Dedi Dinarto and Titi Anggraini",
    "date": "No. 101 \u2013 21 May 2020",
    "content": "ON 23 SEPTEMBER 2020, the Indonesian government is expected to organise another simultaneous regional elections (Pilkada Serentak) \u2013 electing regional leaders such as governors, mayors and regents across the country in nine provinces, 224 regencies, and 37 municipalities. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the Indonesian government to rethink its plan to organise such an important electoral event. With the Large-Scale Social Restriction (PSBB) policy still in place to limit mass movements and gatherings, the General Election Commission (KPU) as the sole organiser and a handful of civil society groups have expressed doubts whether the regional leadership elections can be held on the designated date. Scholars and pundits also teamed up to urge the Indonesian government to reschedule the election day. Government Regulation in Lieu of Law This pressure has resulted in Minister of Home Affairs Tito Karnavian\u2019s proposition to the Presidential Palace to issue a Government Regulation in lieu of law (Peraturan Pemerintah Pengganti Undang-Undang or Perppu) No 2/2020 in early May 2020. This led to the rescheduling of the regional elections to 9 December 2020. Notwithstanding the proposal, the Perppu has apparently sparked public controversy for leaving unaddressed the major problems that needed to be resolved, such as budgetary issues, resource allocation, health protocol, and even the daunting prospect of a return of indirect elections at the regional or local levels. The recently issued government regulation reveals two major shortcomings: it was too generic and simplistic. It only covers three main changes, namely the postponement of the regional elections due to the COVID-19 situation; the rescheduling of the election to December 2020; and the potential for further rescheduling if the election cannot be held in December 2020. This limited outcome is unsurprising since the decision-making process was conducted in a hurry and relied heavily on a virtual meeting platform. The virtual meeting, which aimed to produce a preliminary decision for the government regulation, took place in the middle of April 2020. It involved the home affairs minister, members of the House of Representatives (DPR), KPU, and civil society groups. The live stream of the virtual meeting revealed that communication established among the stakeholders was dislocated and inefficient as evidenced by a vexed parliamentary member who retorted during the consultation: \u201cHurry up! It is five o\u2019clock in the evening and we have to adjourn the meeting.\u201d How Did the Public Respond? Civil society groups and academics have criticised the regulation in lieu of law as it signals uncertainty and causes further disruption at the election\u2019s management level. Rather than opting for a more flexible timeframe, for instance postponing the election to June or September 2021, the Jokowi government instead proposed a rescheduling formula based on tripartite agreements between KPU, Government and DPR. Another issue is that the regulation in lieu of law lacks a detailed explanation on how the Pilkada \u2500 the simultaneous regional elections \u2500 should be operationalised under stringent health protocols and whether budgetary allocations by a cash-strapped government in a COVID-19 era would be available. Even though the KPU is able to come up with the health protocol \u2500 the provision of masks, hand sanitisers, thermometers, disinfectants, and personal protective equipment \u2500 nothing can be implemented without financial support from the government. Despite the claim that the fund has been secured by local governments, the possibility of those funding to be reallocated for curbing the COVID-19 remains wide open. The combination of cost overruns and uncertainties caused by government procrastination creates further complications. In addition, the narrow window of opportunity between the month of September and December creates more technical problems for the KPU to fast-track the election stages from factual verifications for independent candidates, voter\u2019s data registration, candidate\u2019s registration, all the way up to the recapitulation or vote counting process. Entering Murky Waters? The implementation of regional leadership elections is entering murky waters because wide-ranging problems remain unaddressed. Should the election be held in December 2020, budgetary problems would affect KPU\u2019s execution of the Pilkada. A reduced budget implies a lack of capacity to hire supplementary administrative field staff to assist on the ground as well as provide facilities and infrastructure. Not to mention that the absence of health facilities on voting day would increase the prospect of COVID-19 infections. If the election cannot be held in December 2020, there are two potential scenarios. First, the government could expect to embark on another rescheduled election subject to the COVID-19 situation per June 2020. The home affairs minister has stated that if the pandemic does not subside in June 2020, a rescheduling can be expected. If the rescheduled election is set beyond February 2021, this would leave more than 200 regional executive positions vacant and subsequently filled with ad interim figures (penjabat sementara). The appointment of active military and police officers to fill these positions would be inevitable. The other extreme scenario would be a move towards an indirect election system. Considering that direct elections involve mass gatherings at polling stations, the return of the indirect election system where the Regional House of Representatives (DPRD) are given the authority to elect a regional or local leader could be a plausible option for the government. If this turns out to be the outcome, then the principle that common people hold political power and can rule either directly or through elected representatives is gravely at risk. Having a decisive and more detailed regulatory framework would provide clarity for the organisation of Pilkada."

    "title": "China-India Galwan Conflict: The Perils of Nationalism",
    "author(s)": "By KB Teo",
    "date": "No. 136 \u2013 2 July 2020",
    "content": "ON 16 JUNE 2020, brutal fist fighting broke out between Chinese and Indian troops at the Galwan Valley, Ladakh, in the Himalayas. It is 4,300 metres above sea level, with snow-capped mountains. The area is next to Aksai Chin and near China\u2019s Xinjiang province. New Delhi said 20 Indian soldiers, including a senior officer, were killed. Both sides have been actively boosting their military hardware there. There is no settled boundary where the flare-up occurred, only a tenuous Line of Actual Control (LAC) separating Chinese and Indian troops. China\u2019s Motivations China has three main motivations behind the incident. First, Aksai Chin and Xinjiang are of strategic importance to Beijing. Aksai Chin provides China with land access to the south of the mountainous Himalayas to the Indian Ocean. China conducts nuclear and long-range missile tests at Lop Nur in Xinjiang, a region with vast oil and gas resources. Second, Beijing is irked by India's military upgrading and renewed territorial claims to Aksai Chin. This region has been under Chinese administration since the 1950s and the construction of a highway there was one of the triggers of the China-India war in 1962. Only a fragile peace prevailed, with occasional military skirmishes. China and India share a long land border whose actual length is in dispute. On 18 June 2020, Indian Home Minister Amit Shah vowed to take back Aksai Chin (by force), again irking Beijing. Through its control of significant points in Aksai Chin, such as Patrolling Point 14, China is able to gain a strong military advantage in overlooking Indian military positions in the region. At the same time, China and Pakistan have been relentlessly upgrading the strategic Karakoram Highway, something which India views with trepidation. Today, a stronger China has an assertive foreign policy, setting aside Deng Xiaoping\u2019s advice to \u201cHide your capabilities; Bide your time\u201d. Indian Ocean as a Strategic Region Third, Beijing sees the Indian Ocean as a strategic region. The United States has been strongly cultivating India, as part of its anti-China strategy. China has a strong ally in Pakistan which Beijing strongly supported since the 1970s. Over the past 30 years, Beijing has significantly expanded its engagements and presence in the Indian Ocean region. American and Indian strategists have raised fears about China\u2019s expansionism. New Delhi sees Beijing\u2019s Indian Ocean plan as anti-India. China views Pakistan\u2019s Navy as a helpful partner in tying down Indian resources in the Arabian Sea, away from the Indian Ocean region. China has strengthened ties with Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives, and Myanmar. Beijing\u2019s \u201cstring of pearls\u201d doctrine seeks a stable balance of power in the Indian Ocean region. This is one way that Beijing is reducing New Delhi\u2019s dominance in South Asia. India\u2019s Motivations India too has three main motivations. First, New Delhi sees the Indian Ocean as its own backyard. India sees China\u2019s growing presence there as a major strategic challenge. But Beijing does not view the Indian Ocean as India\u2019s sole preserve. China is claiming sovereignty over the Galwan Valley where both countries have enhanced infrastructures, especially roads, bridges, and airstrips. Second, India is, however, quite dependent on China for trade and investments. China is India\u2019s second largest trading partner. China\u2019s investments in India totalled US$26 billion (2019), compared to lower level of foreign direct investments from other Asian countries like South Korea and Japan. Many Indian companies are dependent on China for critical supplies. India has a huge trade deficit of $56.8 billion (2019), its largest with any state in the world. There are 54 Indian companies operating in China. They are in manufacturing, healthcare, and financial services. Third, India seeks to undermine China\u2019s close economic and military ties with Pakistan, New Delhi\u2019s arch rival in the region. Consequences of India-China Tensions There are a number of consequences of this Sino-Indian rivalry. One, China and India are the world\u2019s two most populous states (1.4 billion, and 1.3 billion respectively). They are both the world\u2019s emerging technological powers, and changing the global balance of power. Two, they are both nuclear-armed. A Sino-Indian war would have geopolitical reverberations worldwide. The summit diplomacy between President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is over, for the foreseeable future. Three, both China and India have very nationalistic political and military leaderships. President Xi is facing growing domestic challenges: his handling of COVID-19 is facing strong domestic criticisms; is slowing down, raising the Chinese economy unemployment and threatening key private sector activities. He has to be seen domestically as strong in foreign policy. This will boost his political legitimacy. In military terms, China is stronger than India. China is the larger spender on defence, $266 billion in 2019. India spends about $70 billion. Another Sino-Indian war would be disastrous for both. For the past ten years, Sino-Indian rivalry has steadily intensified, but remained largely stable. India and China have also been more engaged. Bilateral trade increased 67 times between 1998 and 2012. Thousands of Indian students have flocked to Chinese universities. Both sides have also held joint military exercises. Perils of Extreme Nationalism Both China and India have a nationalistic foreign policy to advance their respective geopolitical interests. China\u2019s \u201cstring of pearls\u201d doctrine has already built strong links with Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives, and Myanmar. This should not be a surprise. From Beijing\u2019s viewpoint, the Indian Ocean is critical because it links the oil-rich Middle East with an economically vibrant Asia. This will lessen Beijing\u2019s \u201cMalacca Strait dilemma\u201d, where China\u2019s oil supply passes through and is seen by Beijing as a potential choke point. Beijing is seeking to counter Washington\u2019s hostile encirclement policy. On the other hand, it is not in China\u2019s long-term interests to worsen ties with India. It will only push India closer to the US and other US partners such as Australia, Japan, South Korea and those in Europe. The Galwan Valley episode showed the perils of extreme nationalism on both sides, but Chinese media have prudently called for a resumption of Sino-Indian dialogue to restore cordial and mutually beneficial ties."

    "title": "Global Health Security COVID-19 & Its Impacts Pandemic\u2019s Effect on Counter-Terrorism",
    "author(s)": "By Kalicharan Veera Singam",
    "date": "No. 046 \u2013 16 March 2021",
    "content": "WITH THE outbreak of the pandemic, most governments were compelled to divert resources away from counter-terrorism to mitigate the unprecedented health and economic crisis. Societies are now confronted with a changed terrorism landscape that continues to evolve. At the onset of the pandemic itself there was speculation that terrorism will no longer be the same. The ways in which security threats have evolved over the last year confirms this shift. As some countries have started administering COVID-19 vaccines and progress is being made to bring the spread of the virus under control, there is an expectation that more resources would be allocated for counter-terrorism efforts. Counter-terrorism approaches are also adapting in some important ways. Of particular interest and concern are technologies that were developed out of necessity during the pandemic which are being considered or already being applied in counter-terrorism efforts. Given the rise of far-right extremism in some countries, more domestic surveillance made possible by technologies developed during the pandemic can also be expected. Evolving Threat Landscape & the Rising Far-Right A few changes in extremism and terrorism could be attributed directly to the pandemic. For example, the pandemic had a significant economic impact accentuating poverty and socio-economic inequalities. The doom and gloom of the lockdowns, for some, increased perceptions of hopelessness and despair. Inability to contain the spread of the virus also increased anti-government sentiments in a few countries. These conditions gave terrorist groups opportunities to present their extremist narratives for a new social and global order to a larger and more receptive audience. But not all militant groups were intent on disrupting societies. Some groups are also engaged in \u201cpro-social activities\u201d (These comprised social welfare initiatives such as distributing humanitarian aid to populations affected by the pandemic). Engagement in pandemic relief operations provided these groups invaluable administrative and governance capabilities and widened their support base. There have also been some changes on the ideological front during the pandemic. Most notably, different variants of right-wing extremism have arisen as another major ideological source that spawns violent political action. Although the terrorist threat from right-wing extremist ideologies is not new, the pandemic fast-tracked their rise over the past year. At the onset of the pandemic governments had to prioritise their response to the health crisis and the economic fallout. This provided the space for the rise of right-wing extremist groups and their rhetoric to flourish. \u201cAnti-migrant, anti-Semitic, anti-Asian, racist and xenophobic\u201d conspiracy theories heightened during the pandemic. The socio-economic disruptions were seen by some far-right groups as further confirmation that the current social and global order is flawed and its disintegration should be expedited. Governments\u2019 Increasing Domestic Surveillance Capabilities As the security landscape transforms, so will governments\u2019 capabilities. To effectively deal with the augmented terrorist threat, governments are likely to free-up some of their resources that were diverted earlier to address the health crisis. At the onset of the pandemic, counter-terrorism technologies and in some cases even security agencies were repurposed to fight the spread of the coronavirus. The unprecedented and all-consuming nature of the pandemic warranted this diversion. With the slow but steady progress some governments are starting to make in rolling out vaccines and limiting the spread of the virus the return of some of these resources back to counter-terrorism can be expected. Additionally, governments could also deploy technologies that were developed out of necessity during the pandemic for counter-terrorism use. In a few developed Asian countries in particular there was extensive and active deployment of advanced technology for contact tracing which contributed to their relative success in limiting the spread of the virus. In these societies, though some were opposed, most citizens submitted themselves to be tracked and forego some of their personal liberties. To others, monitoring the spread of the virus took precedence over privacy and concerns of big government. Some governments are likely to take advantage of the public\u2019s increased receptiveness to monitoring and tracking for counter-terrorism purposes. Besides contact tracing and monitoring, biometric data collection and surveillance also intensified during the pandemic and could potentially be used in counter-terrorism policing. Governments\u2019 Decreasing External Surveillance Capabilities The capacity of governments to directly monitor overseas terrorist networks has also been reduced. This is in contrast to governments\u2019 domestic surveillance capabilities, which as noted above, increased during the pandemic. At an ICPVTR Webinar on \u201cWhat Happens Now? Terrorism and the Challenges of Counter-Terrorism in the Next Decade,\u201d Suzanne Raine from the Centre for Geopolitics at Cambridge University noted that the on-the-ground monitoring of overseas terrorist networks has been affected. Governments\u2019 resource capabilities to monitor foreign terrorist groups at hotspots in parts of the Middle East and Afghanistan have shrunk, resulting in a reduction in the direct monitoring and intelligence gathering of those groups. The travel restrictions and lockdowns also affected the news media\u2019s independent reporting on groups in the Middle East which was another invaluable source of information for counter-terrorism. For most governments, it would seem logical to look inward to curb domestic terrorism during the pandemic. But the reduction in the monitoring of terrorist groups that are based overseas might be a huge blind spot with long term implications for cross-border terrorism. The security landscape, though not completely transformed by the pandemic, has changed in significant ways. The increased threat from right-wing extremist groups which occurred in part due to the pandemic, is a new area of concern. As societies gradually emerge out of COVID-19, the pandemic\u2019s effects on the terrorist threat landscape would become clearer. Counter-terrorism measures are already adapting to the evolving threat landscape but they would continue to require fresh lenses to keep up with the changing threats."

    "title": "Trump Impeachment Aftermath: Implications for Global Politics and Security",
    "author(s)": "By Adam Garfinkle",
    "date": "No. 027 \u2013 17 February 2020",
    "content": "IT IS no big revelation that the churning dysfunctions of American politics are bound to affect American foreign and national security policies, and with them the rest of the world in one way or another. This is because the United States is no ordinary country. It is big, wealthy, powerful, and attention-arresting as a model of public life \u2500 whether on account of its core principles of Enlightenment-born liberalism, its tendency to anti- hierarchical egalitarianism, its secularism-nested multiculturalist reality, or all of the above as a package deal. These characteristics are irrepressible ideological lightning rods, taken separately or especially together. They strike some as aspirational, others as mortal threats. No one, however, knows how to ignore them. The Great Drama of Trump\u2019s Impeachment America\u2019s imprimatur on the current global order has been second to none since the end of World War II. It has not only affected nearly every aspect of global security, but it has shaped the global commercial/trading system and influenced deeply, for better and probably also otherwise, the world\u2019s emerging globe-spanning cultural m\u00e9lange. If American influence essentially collapses because of domestic political crisis and others fill the vacuum, all these shapes will change, sooner than later. The great drama of Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives and his summary acquittal by the Republican-controlled Senate affects all of this, both by way of prospective policy and by means of images and optics. It\u2019s not the only causal factor pressing on US policies, and how significant an inflection point it turns out to be in its own right is for the fickle future to determine. Even so, several broad implications can already be proffered. Nearly everyone involved in the impeachment affair and its many political outcroppings \u2500 the Republican and Democratic Parties, the mainstream media, the FBI, the Justice Department, and one could go on \u2500 has behaved badly. In some cases, very badly. The harm done to the health of American political culture is likely severe, and may not be fully recoverable. Acquittal has defined presidential deviancy down, harmed the structure of the separation of powers, and made a mockery of the rule of law. The problem has been metastazing for years, even before Donald Trump\u2019s election as president, but the impeachment debacle lays the dysfunction bare and likely accelerates it, as a dam breaking before a storm surge invites the deluge. The Impaling of American Soft Power The US brand, its \u201csoft power\u201d with it, has now been impaled for all to see on the boundless egos of a demagogic pretender and his spineless sycophants. To the extent that America was ever, as Abraham Lincoln said, \u201cthe last best hope for mankind\u201d or, as Governor John Winthrop famously put it, \u201ca city on a hill\u201d, the hope is fading as the lights in the city go out one by one. But that does not exhaust the implications for the world at large. Above all, the head- in-the-sand inward turn of America, away from the wider world and the responsibilities its power ordains, will now accelerate. Splenetic politics is so completely enveloping everything it touches that actual policy issues and choices no longer even rate mention. All higher-level policy formulation will likely cease or become sporadic and even less deliberate in their formulation; only political signalling using foreign policy issues as props looks to remain. Ongoing policy implementation, mostly at lower levels, is on autopilot whenever the White House avoids tampering with it. It loses energy daily without rational direction from above. Case in point: The Ukraine aid holdup affair and the infamous July 25 Trump - Zelensky phone call. No member of the political class, or the Fourth Estate, even bothers to ask whether the policy of supplying lethal aid to Ukraine is actually a good idea. Worse, no one ventures a public thought about what it would take for American diplomacy to actually help fix the problems that caused the Russo-Ukrainian mini-war in the first place. Gone are the days when Henry Kissinger and the late Zbigniew Brzezinski both warned against pursuing the policy currently in place and offered constructive suggestions for a deeper resolution. Trump\u2019s Politics of Diversion: Mideast & Taiwan Another case in point: The so-called Middle East peace \u201cdeal of the century\u201d was promulgated entirely for reasons of politics \u2500 Trump\u2019s politics of diversion and pandering, and by extension Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s politics of desperation. Not only is the plan a non-starter for any practical purpose, it erodes past partial Israeli- Palestinian understandings in escrow, jeopardises Israeli-Palestinian Authority security cooperation, encourages irretrievably harmful Israeli overextension (read: annexation of the Jordan Valley, and maybe more), jeopardises the Hashemite Kingdom and the Israel-Jordan peace treaty, and reduces Arab normalisation energies with regard to Israel. No one involved in this toxic abortion seems to care, even assuming they understand any of damage its promulgation may do. Another case in point: Former Senator Sam Brownback, now in charge of the Trump Administration\u2019s Religious Freedom Alliance (RFA), met with the Taiwanese vice- president elect William Lai on 5 February in Washington. That made him the highest- ranking Taiwanese official to visit in more than four decades. China\u2019s response? A PLAAF run at Taiwan\u2019s air-defence perimeter, causing the Taiwanese air force to scramble jet fighters. Were it not for the coronavirus crisis, the Chinese government no doubt would have played this into a major crisis in expectation of the US side backing down. As it turned out, so acute is Trump\u2019s attention deficit and risk-aversion in security issues that Beijing did not even need to do that. The State Department\u2019s response to the jet feint? To exclude Taiwan from the RFA, in which it had been a planning partner from the start. Post Impeachment: Worst Yet to Come Beyond America? Obviously, as this example illustrates, the Interagency-White House process nexus is in tatters. As a result, neither friend nor foe can tell anymore whether US policy is coming or going, or whether it actually exists at all. This isn\u2019t an entirely new condition, but the impeachment debacle as fevered introduction to a presidential election season has made it worse and so newly dangerous. For many who sincerely care about human freedom, human rights, human dignity and mutual toleration, and the basic decency and integrity of political life, this is not good news. In the absence of American power, resolve, and, yes, even its example up on that hill, hyenas will ramble, and the wild dogs will sooner or later find their prey. So it is over? Whatever its past shortcomings, is America really over as the world\u2019s beacon of liberty, protector of virtue, guardian of the weak? Is there no way back? No one knows. But we do know that with the recent impeachment proceedings resting in the archives, the worst of the peril is yet to come, for Americans and not only Americans."

It marks the first parliamentary meeting since Muhyiddin Yassin took over as prime minister through the controversial Sheraton Move, bringing into power a new governing coalition informally known as the Perikatan Nasional (PN). When he was sworn in on 1 March, the deposed ruling coalition Pakatan Harapan (PH) immediately disputed Muhyiddin\u2019s claim to majority support. One of Muhyiddin\u2019s first decisions as prime minister was to postpone the parliamentary sitting scheduled for 9 March to 16 April \u2013 a move clearly designed to buy time and consolidate support. Muhyiddin\u2019s MCO Muhyiddin\u2019s steps taken to stem the COVID-19 pandemic were drastic. The Movement Control Order (MCO), which began in the middle of March, is now in its fifth phase and has been instrumental in reducing infection rates. Economic stimulus packages amounting to RM260 billion (S$85 billion) have also been rolled out, though there is considerable debate over their effectiveness. House Speaker Mohamad Ariff Mohd Yusof had initially accepted the recently ousted table a no-confidence prime minister Mahathir Mohamad\u2019s proposal to motion.  However, following the advice of Muhyiddin, the Speaker subsequently announced that there would be no other agenda items after the King\u2019s address on 18 May as the COVID-19 virus outbreak has not been fully contained. Not even government legislation will be tabled. The Malaysian government has been commended for safeguarding public health in its handling of the COVID-19 outbreak. Still, the steps taken to limit parliamentary debate have been criticised as undemocratic and undermining governance procedures. Muhyiddin\u2019s majority has yet to be tested in parliament either. This gives the impression that Muhyiddin is, arguably, insecure. Has Muhyiddin the Numbers? Both Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) President, Anwar Ibrahim and Mahathir have, however, conceded that Muhyiddin may have the requisite numbers supporting him. Estimates place members of parliament (MPs) supporting Muhyiddin at between 113 and 118 out of a total of 222. However, there are reports that some PN parliamentarians are \u201cstuck overseas\u201d because of travel restrictions. Thus, there was a risk that the opposition would thwart government legislation or successfully unseat Muhyiddin if a vote is called on 18 May. Nonetheless, trends indicate that Muhyiddin\u2019s position is increasingly secure. Firstly, while relations between Muhyiddin\u2019s Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu) and the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) remain testy, there has been a shift. Early on, many senior UMNO leaders expressed their frustrations at being treated like a junior party. Even though it has the most MPs at 39, only 17 ministerial and deputy ministerial positions went to the party. In contrast, Bersatu leaders account for 24 such positions out of the 30 to 32 MPs who back Muhyiddin. Reduced access to government positions and the accompanying resources limit the extent to which UMNO can exercise patronage and consolidate power. UMNO\u2019s Position of Expediency UMNO Deputy President Mohamad Hasan has stated that UMNO\u2019s alliance with Bersatu was done purely for short-term expediency. The implicit threat was that the UMNO-led Barisan Nasional (BN), along with Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS), could well chart their own course in the next general election. That said, the odds of UMNO withdrawing its support for PN at the moment are slim. Even though it may feel sidelined, UMNO still prefers some degree of access to the government. A growing number of UMNO MPs have also been appointed to head various government-linked companies (GLCs), with the expectation that more could receive similar positions. This may have eased immediate pressures on UMNO-Bersatu relations. Indeed, UMNO President Zahid Hamidi has said that BN will not rule out formalising PN as a coalition, though of course the negotiating process would be long-drawn. PN and the State Assemblies Movements in various state assemblies since the beginning of May also indicate that PN is solidifying its position. The Johor and Perak state assemblies have been rife with infighting between Bersatu and UMNO. Bersatu\u2019s state assembly men have voiced their disgruntlement at being overlooked for state GLC positions by the UMNO Menteri Besar (chief minister), Hasni Mohammad. The dispute hit a high note after Bersatu\u2019s Johor chapter seemed willing to support an opposition-led no-confidence motion against Hasni. Indeed, Muhyiddin had to intervene and mediate the dispute, while the influential Sultan of Johor ultimately put to bed the possibility of a no-confidence motion by warning against any \u201cdisruption\u201d. The dispute in Perak was similarly centred around UMNO-Bersatu relations. Bersatu\u2019s Ahmad Faizal Azumu is the state\u2019s menteri besar even though the party only has four seats. UMNO has 25. UMNO was dissatisfied with negotiations over state executive council positions. But after UMNO finally received the three remaining executive council positions on 12 May, tensions were eased. On the same day, Mukhriz Mahathir, who is challenging Muhyiddin for president of Bersatu in its ongoing party elections, lost control of the Kedah state government after two state assemblymen aligned with Azmin Ali quit PKR and announced their support for a PN-led state government. These recent developments in Johor, Perak and Kedah suggest that Muhyiddin is gaining his footing. How Long Can Muhyiddin Delay the Vote? While Muhyiddin\u2019s majority is razor thin, it is evident that the opposition is not operating from a position of strength either. Anwar has been named the leader of the opposition, but he only has the explicit support of the 92 MPs in PH. A handful of Bersatu MPs and Parti Warisan Sabah (Warisan) still back Mahathir. While appearing unlikely, a rapprochement between Mahathir and Muhyiddin sometime after the Bersatu party elections in the second half of 2020 cannot be ruled out. Should this happen, PH\u2019s position would be weakened further. Clearly, the splits in the opposition benefit Muhyiddin. While UMNO-Bersatu relations may have improved lately, the alliance\u2019s instability is indisputable. There is much that would need to be resolved before they can work together smoothly. Whether the opposition will be able to take advantage of this, however, remains a question mark. While Muhyiddin\u2019s legitimacy is being contested, no doubt, he is the default prime minister until and unless UMNO, PAS and the PH-led opposition are ready for a snap general election. Given the COVID-19 situation and the difficult economic condition faced by Malaysians, triggering a general election that is estimated to cost up to RM800 million (S$265 million) is unlikely to be well-received publicly. Yet, delaying parliamentary proceedings will hang over Muhyiddin and only allow questions over his government\u2019s legitimacy to linger. Muhyiddin will, sooner rather than later, have to prove his majority \u2013 be it through a vote on the no-confidence motion or a vote on other legislation. Already opposition leaders say the one-day sitting of parliament shows that PN is afraid to face the no-confidence vote."

    "author(s)": "By Dymples Leong",
    "date": "No. 123 \u2013 17 June 2020",
    "content": "COUNTRIES AROUND the world have implemented various approaches to tackle COVID-19. As the race to develop a vaccine continues, governments face various challenges in communicating public health guidelines to citizens, including information dissemination and combatting the COVID-19 infodemic \u2013 a term used to describe the spread of coronavirus-related misinformation online. Providing accurate information to the public is key to fighting the pandemic. As misinformation threatens to undermine public health guidelines, how can practitioners utilise various strategies and tools to effectively communicate with the public? Nebulous Flow of Information It is vital for governments to provide accurate public information to people, particularly during times of crisis. Reliable information from governments enables the public to make informed decisions. COVID-19 has been the subject of new discoveries and insights, and its mutable, evolving status makes it harder to convey latest developments into practical and actionable guidelines for the public. As people attempt to seek understanding and clarity, rapidly changing information \u2013 with anxiety of physical and emotional impacts of the virus \u2013 can contribute to bewilderment. The exploitation of desire for answers and solutions provides fertile ground for susceptible audiences to engage with misinformation. Disinformation and Misinformation Effective disinformation is often constructed with enough familiarity to be persuasive, populated with vivid personal stories and descriptive language to invoke strong emotions, such as fear and anger. Social media algorithms drive engagement towards content with strong emotional response. This enables disinformation to drown out official information sources. Disinformation content is often packaged professionally, distorting audiences\u2019 perception of the contents\u2019 authenticity. The conspiracy documentary, \u201cPlandemic\u201d, for instance, garnered up to 2.5 million likes, shares and comments on Facebook, driving the documentary to mainstream attention, despite refutations from fact-checkers. Similarly, misinformation can also undermine public health measures, even when mistakenly and unintentionally spread. It can amplify confusion, sow distrust, and inspire people to ignore public health guidelines, potentially endangering lives. In some cases, people with ill intent can combine misinformation and disinformation to cause unrest, such as falsely attributing the cause of COVID-19 to 5G technology, resulting in physical attacks against 5G telecomm towers and workers. Conflicting Signals Unfortunately, official sources can add to the confusion if they provide conflicting and unclear advice. Such advice can further perpetuate the state of ambiguity. Inconsistent messaging brings about confusion, annoyance and mistrust, leading to public frustration with health directives. This could potentially result in a reduction of compliance by the public in following guidelines (e.g. mask-wearing in public). For instance, criticism over the British government\u2019s messaging over its updated \u2018Stay Alert\u2019 slogan has led communication experts to decry the mixed messaging efforts. This has resulted in confusion and doubt over the guidance for different sets of circumstances. Inconsistent messaging has also led to disastrous consequences. Mixed messaging on public health directives and social distancing guidelines from Brazilian government officials have worsened the health crisis. In contrast, Singapore, in response to public uncertainty and confusion, the Ministry of Health clarified that face masks, and not face shields, were to be the default face covering in Singapore as the country entered the first phase of reopening. Clear, Concise, Transparent Communication Public messaging can be a highly effective way of mobilising citizens to tackle COVID- 19 when there is effective policy planning and implementation. Social media and messaging platforms are widely seen as essential crisis communication tools for governments and institutions. These channels have been used in countries including Singapore and India to directly disseminate crucial COVID- 19 related information \u2013 broadcasting new updates and public health regulations. Messaging platforms such as Telegram channels created by governments and health authorities have gained popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments in countries like Singapore and Australia have utilised these channels to combat misinformation and disinformation. Helping users access information from verified channels makes it easier, while reducing the confusion and anxiety about unverified sources of information. By minimising the friction and effort involved in information search, the risk of potential engagement with misinformation is reduced. When public health sources present actionable information presented in a transparent and easily accessible way, people are empowered to take actionable steps to safeguard themselves from COVID-19. For instance, websites or channels could be designed to facilitate greater user-friendly information search. Officials should also provide public briefings in clear, concise language. Singapore\u2019s Case Singapore adopts a multi-channel communication strategy to disseminate COVID-19 related developments. Regular press conferences by the multi-ministry task force enables citizens to be updated on latest developments. The same consistent messaging is reinforced on multiple channels of communication. These range from traditional media such as print and television, to social media and messaging platforms WhatsApp and Telegram. Explainers illustrated in visual format break down guidelines to be easily understood and \u2018digestible\u2019 for the public. A potential step to further improve communications could involve the usage of a single, central repository website or channel to answer public health announcements and guidelines. This repository can be used to consolidate and unify existing websites maintained by individual ministries and agencies. The repository could be utilised to answer queries from the public. For example, in the Indian state of Karnataka, COVID-19 related questions are answered by a dedicated team of state administrators and public health officials, who then direct subscribers to verified sources of public health information. This helps the dissemination of accurate information and reduces the proliferation of misinformation. New \u2018Normal\u2019 Practitioners should also maintain persuasiveness in the face of shifting advice. As public-health recommendations often change due to new developments, persuading citizens to adapt to new behaviours is a continuing process. While enforcement can contribute to greater compliance with public health guidelines, persuading \u2018buy-in\u2019 from citizens while being authentic, empathetic, and transparent can enable citizens to comply better during this pandemic. Accurate and actionable information contributes value and relief in times of uncertainty and confusion, especially during a public health crisis like COVID-19. As countries tackle this societal threat, good communication has become more vital than ever. The continued emphasis on timely dissemination of clear, transparent and accurate public health information, even as governments continue to relax restriction guidelines globally, remains a powerful way to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic."

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence: Sustaining Singapore\u2019s AI Ambitions",
    "author(s)": "By Manoj Harjani, Dymples Leong & Teo Yi-Ling",
    "date": "No. 201 \u2013 24 November 2020",
    "content": "IN 2019, SINGAPORE launched its National AI Strategy (NAIS) in pursuit of its three- point vision of the Smart Nation: First, Singapore aims to be a global hub for developing, test-bedding and scaling AI solutions. Second, AI will be used by government to deliver anticipatory and personalised services, and by businesses to generate growth in key economic sectors. Lastly, Singaporeans will be equipped with the requisite skills and competencies to thrive in an AI-driven economy. Aligning the vision for Singapore\u2019s AI ecosystem to the broader Smart Nation effort should translate to greater coherence for various public sector AI initiatives, minimising the need to manage competing visions. The emphasis on developing Singapore into a global hub for AI solutions recalls a familiar \u2013 and relatively successful \u2013 playbook used by policymakers in the past for sectors of the economy ranging from transportation to financial services. There is also a clear intent to deliver social and economic gains for Singaporeans, whether through better government services or developing local workforce capabilities. Humans Still in the Loop One of the key challenges faced by the NAIS is addressing an oft-cited concern around the shortage Singapore faces in both the quality and quantity of talent required for the wide range of AI-related job roles. Since 2017, AI Singapore (AISG) \u2013 a cross-agency national AI capability building including graduate scholarships, initiatives programme \u2013 has apprenticeships and professional conversion programmes targeting individuals in adjacent STEM and digital job roles as well as mature workers. rolled out AISG\u2019s \u201cAI for Industry\u201d initiative aims to train 25,000 professionals in basic AI programming skills in Python by 2025. Furthermore, AISG is scaling up broader AI literacy to reach 100,000 adult and school-going Singaporeans by 2025. Nevertheless, chasing training throughput targets is only one tactic in trying to push Singapore towards realising its AI ambitions. Putting individuals through training does not guarantee deeper capabilities. Greater emphasis could instead be given to solving common business problems such as productivity and personalisation by training employees to implement off-the-shelf AI solutions. AISG already has enablement and \u201cquick start\u201d programmes for SMEs which could be expanded on a sectoral basis and strengthened by emphasising capability development to close the gap between available AI solutions and their adoption. Attracting AI Talent At the same time, building capabilities to solve common business problems using AI will not diminish the importance of attracting top-tier international AI talent. While off- the-shelf solutions are increasingly available, AI remains a largely \u201cartisanal\u201d endeavour, requiring specialised hardware, programming, and highly skilled talent to bring hardware and software together for meaningful applications. It has yet to be fully \u201cindustrialised\u201d, allowing it to achieve the kind of scale required to deploy it effectively and without the challenges of bias. This means that programmes such as Tech@SG, which facilitate company-level Employment Pass (EP) applications to build core teams for tech companies, remain critical. However, a spanner in the works is presenting itself: it is not yet clear how the new EP criteria announced in September 2020 to address COVID-19\u2019s economic impact on local jobs will affect such programmes. The Ministry of Manpower has raised the minimum qualifying salary for EP applications to S$4,500 for all new applicants from 1 May 2021. With economic uncertainty due to the pandemic likely to persist into 2021, there may be direct implications for tech companies looking to bring in talent. Further, the recently announced Tech.Pass scheme (an extension of Tech@SG) is intended to increase the attractiveness of Singapore in attracting top-tier tech professionals. Unlike an EP, it is linked to the individual instead of a company, which provides comparatively more professional flexibility. It remains to be seen if this scheme will gain traction. Will \u201cHub Strategy\u201d Still Work? In the year since the NAIS was launched, the intensifying rivalry between China and the United States has threatened to disrupt the international collaboration and flow of talent to America that drives research in AI. Singapore\u2019s ability to develop a global hub for AI solutions could potentially benefit from this if international researchers and companies are looking for a neutral space to continue collaborating and developing solutions. At the same time, cities like Berlin, London, Paris and Tel Aviv already possess well- developed AI ecosystems that can easily absorb new talent and investments \u2013 and it is useful in understanding why these places are attractive. Over and above the high demand for talent, there appear to be other pertinent factors influencing the decision of international talent and companies in setting up in Singapore. The NAIS must therefore reevaluate where Singapore stands in relation to its competitors, taking into account new initiatives such as the European Union\u2019s white paper on AI and complementary data strategy published in February 2020. These documents position the EU to harness its capabilities and resources at a regional level, which for now is an unrealistic prospect for Singapore and ASEAN, given that much of Southeast Asia is at the early stages of AI adoption. Prospects for Singapore\u2019s AI Ambitions The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the government\u2019s capabilities in rapidly developing and implementing AI solutions. Efforts such as VigilantGantry and SPOTON, which use AI to assist in effective temperature screening with minimal manpower, validate the NAIS\u2019 emphasis on developing and deploying solutions. However, they also serve to highlight the fact that AI solutions require careful experimentation in a set-up that differs considerably from traditional software engineering. Furthermore, unlike established general-purpose technologies, the economics of AI are not yet fully understood, and much of the existing research and applications have yet to deliver significant real-world impact. However, the NAIS appears to assume that the economics of AI follows a logic similar to a value chain, with Singapore\u2019s chosen niche in the deployment of AI solutions. Given that the NAIS has been described as \u201ca living document\u201d, it may need to be revisited from time to time and continuously reviewed to ensure it remains relevant as AI evolves rapidly across technical, ethical and socio-economic dimensions."

    "title": "Global Health Security: COVID-19 & Its Impacts Jokowi\u2019s War on Pandemic: Growing Dependence on TNI?",
    "author(s)": "By Chaula R Anindya and Sigit S. Nugroho",
    "date": "No. 088 \u2013 11 May 2020",
    "content": "FOLLOWING THE declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic as a national disaster, President Joko Widodo (\u201cJokowi\u201d) has granted the National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) a broader authority to handle the outbreak. Doni Monardo, an active three- star Army general who assumed the position of head of BNPB in 2019 before the pandemic broke out, was appointed to lead the COVID-19 Task Force. His position as head of BNPB despite being in active military service is likely to shape the country\u2019s strategy in containing the pandemic. Relying on TNI\u2019s organisational capabilities and networks is aimed at expediting the disaster relief effort to offset the slow response of the civilian authority to the health crisis. TNI\u2019s Tradition in BNPB Leadership Originally, BNPB was not considered a strategic post for an active three-star general. Lieutenant General Monardo\u2019s predecessors, Major General Syamsul Maarif and Rear Admiral Willem Rampangilei were both retired military officers when they headed BNPB. Entrusting Gen. Monardo to lead BNPB suggests that President Jokowi may want to reform Indonesia\u2019s disaster relief management. Monardo is qualified to lead BNPB with its organisational structure resembling TNI\u2019s own. Monardo\u2019s command experience and working relationships with TNI active-duty officers mean that BNPB\u2019s coordination with TNI commands on disaster relief operations should improve. As chief of the COVID-19 Task Force, Monardo will receive ministerial support and access to TNI and the Indonesian National Police (Polri)\u2019s operational assets and resources. The inclusion of both TNI and Polri chiefs of operational staff within the task force further enables Monardo to synchronise TNI and Polri operations to curb the pandemic. TNI\u2019s Role in Containing Pandemic With its logistical capabilities, manpower, and geographical reach, TNI\u2019s role has been critical in acquiring and distributing relief supplies across the archipelago. Minister of Defence Prabowo Subianto, himself now part of the COVID-19 Task Force, has directed TNI to collect medical equipment from China and employ its territorial commands to organise medical supply distribution, down to the remote and border areas. TNI has established four Integrated Joint Task Commands (Kogasgabpad) which managed field hospitals in Jakarta (Kemayoran Athlete Village) and Natuna (Sebaru and Galang Islands). Kogasgabpad is not necessarily a new organisation. It is formed on an ad-hoc basis and was first activated in 2018 to assist the earthquake reliefs in Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara. Fortuitously, TNI\u2019s concept of Kogasgabpad mirrors BNPB\u2019s holistic and integrated disaster management command structure and this hopefully will improve coordination in Indonesia\u2019s response to the pandemic. With TNI accelerating safe-the-people campaign at the national level, the territorial commands at the regional levels also initiated their own initiatives, such as blood donation drives to support the Indonesian Red Cross (PMI) which has been running short of blood stocks due to a drop in the number of donors. TNI is also starting soup kitchens to feed the poor. Dilemma of the Military? At the same time, TNI also needs to contain the virus spreading within its own ranks. On 15 April 2020, TNI Commander Air Chief Marshall Hadi Tjahjanto reported that there were at least 1,187 cases related to COVID-19 involving its personnel and their families. Most fall under the category of people under surveillance, with additional 55 positive cases and 15 fatalities, some of whom were medical officers. He asserted that TNI will prioritise rapid tests for its frontline medical personnel. Beyond service on the medical frontlines, TNI should also pay attention to its defence operations amid the outbreak, in view of the two foreign cases. In the USS Theodore Roosevelt, more than 100 out of 4000 sailors were tested positive for COVID-19 after a visit to Vietnam. In the Taiwanese Panshih Navy Ship, 36 out of 750 crews were tested positive for COVID-19 after goodwill trip to Palau. Both cases demonstrate that physical distancing might not work out during military operations, exposing personnel to the risk of infection. Ultimately, these cases accentuate the state's dilemma on military operations during the pandemic: should the military avoid unnecessary peacetime casualties or maintain its operational readiness during the health crisis? Large-Scale Social Restrictions and Polri\u2019s Measures To flatten the curve, President Jokowi has imposed large-scale social restrictions (PSBB) and banned the annual mudik (Eidil Fitri exodus) to the villages. A lockdown seemed unlikely as Jokowi does not believe such measures would eliminate the virus. Hence, the task force has ramped up PSBB measures by deploying Police and TNI personnel at various check points. Law enforcement is solely under the jurisdiction of the Police, with TNI serving as an auxiliary force. The Police are lenient when imposing PSBB as the population is still not-well-informed about the regulations. The Police, though, face challenges due to growing financial stress amid the pandemic. The country has seen an 11.8% rise in crime rates with theft and burglary the most common criminal acts. Inevitably, the Police will be forced to adopt a firm stance to maintain order. A crime prevention approach is a double-edged sword, though. While it might help the Police to induce compliance, there are negative repercussions for its image. Human rights activists oppose criminal charges for PSBB offenders as they believe this will only exacerbate prison overcrowding. The Police struggles to improve its image. A 2019 Kompas survey that showed the Police\u2019s s positive image among public was only 68.6%; while in a similar survey TNI\u2019s positive image was significantly higher at 96.6%. Dependent on Military? President Jokowi remains dependent on the military. This is evident in his appointment of Gen. Monardo as BNPB chief and the use of military agencies to compensate the delay and shortfalls the pandemic. Notwithstanding, a \u201cboots-on-the-ground\u201d approach also requires clear protocols to protect soldiers from the risk of infection. the civilian authorities\u2019 response to in On the whole, current developments triggered by the pandemic have entrenched the notion of TNI as the guardian of the nation. Both TNI and Police's top brass are promoting inter-service cooperation to curb the virus; with their different jurisdictions, the public might have their own perceptions: the Police is seen as the \u201cbad cop\u201d, while TNI is the \u201cgood cop\u201d. Last year, the Police was criticised for its repressive approach to a big rally against the government. TNI though played safe by conducting dialogues with the protestors. A similar pattern could play out if the pandemic leads to huge social unrest in the country."

    "title": "Raisi\u2019s Election: Supreme Leader-President in One?",
    "author(s)": "By Amin Saikal",
    "date": "No. 110 \u2013 16 July 2021",
    "content": "THE ELECTION of hardline cleric, Ebrahim Raisi, to the presidency of Iran has caused alarm in the West. It certainly poses major challenges but could also open opportunities for dealing with Iran more effectively. His rise to the top position streamlines the bifurcated authority between the unelected Supreme Leader and elected president in the Islamic Republic, as the two men will now preach from the same pulpit. Who is Ebrahim Raisi? Raisi has had a controversial past. He has been intimately associated with the Islamic Republic since its inception in the wake of the 1978/79 Iranian revolution. That epochal event overthrew the Shah\u2019s pro-Western monarchy and enabled his chief political- religious opponent Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to establish his Islamic order. Raisi bears the reputation of having been involved in the killing of thousands of political prisoners in 1978, which he claims was for the good of the Islamic Republic. Yet, he has also been an ardent follower of Khomeini\u2019s two-pronged approach to Iran\u2019s transformation: jihadi (ideological and combative) to Islamise state and society, and ijtihadi (reformative and pragmatic) to build a strong and defendable Islamic Republic, capable of resisting outside impositions and interventions. Khomeini opposed the United States as the \u2018Great Satan\u2019 due to the superpower\u2019s past unsavoury involvement in Iran and ongoing hegemonic presence in the region. He called for resistance to the US, along with some of its regional allies (Israel in particular), not only ideologically but also pragmatically whenever required. Instead, he urged his regime to look to the East, Soviet Russia, China and India, to counter the US, and showed no qualms over these powers\u2019 variance to his Shia Islamic disposition, despite having branded the USSR as a \u2018Lesser Satan\u2019. Reliving Khomeini\u2019s Jihadi-Ijtihadi Legacy? Khomeini died in 1989. His successor Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has followed his jihadi- ijtihadi legacy. Khamenei has used his enormous religious authority and constitutional powers to be hardline on principles and flexible in tactics. For example, he backed the July 2015 multilateral Iran nuclear agreement \u2013 the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) \u2013 as an act of \u2018heroic flexibility\u2019 or pragmatism. Raisi embraces the same tradition. He has reached the top through the judiciary, devotion to Khomeini\u2019s concept of Velayat-e Faqih (rule of the Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist) and close links to Khamenei. Prior to running for the presidency and coming second to moderate Hassan Rouhani in the 2017 election and then being appointed by Khamenei to the powerful position of Iran\u2019s Chief Justice, he was the custodian of the very wealthy Astan Quds Razavi Foundation (2016-19). He was also in charge of administering Imam Reza\u2019s shrine in the city of Mashhad, where he concurrently presided over one of the best libraries and museums in Iran. As an author and researcher, I met Raisi a few years ago in Mashhad, a city of religious pilgrimage in northeast Iran. I found him to be hardline ideologically and distrustful of the US and its regional allies, but meanwhile very philosophical and engaging in discussing Iran\u2019s problems. Like Khamenei, he was sceptical of the US fully implementing the nuclear agreement. But he could also see the need for ending the US sanctions and improving the living conditions of the Iranian people. He impressed me that, in tandem with Khamenei and many other conservative colleagues, including some in the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), he could be ijtihadi when the circumstances demanded. Hence his declaration of support as president-elect for the current Vienna negotiations to reach an agreement with the US over the JCPOA and for improving relations with regional Arab countries. Pragmatic Hardliner or Conservative Pragmatist? Raisi is unlikely to engage in any structural reforms that could rock the conservatives\u2019 hold on power or to show flexibility on Iranian national and regional security postures. But as Supreme Leader, he is as much interested in the survival of the regime and therefore prone to pragmatic actions. A fundamental problem of the regime has been its bifurcation between the \u2018sovereignty of God\u2019, embodied in the Supreme Leader, and the \u2018sovereignty of people\u2019, reflected by the elected president. This has caused power struggles and policy confusion when someone from the ijtihadi side has been elected to the presidency, as in the case of Mohammad Khatami (1997-2005) and the outgoing Hassan Rouhani. Raisi\u2019s election places just about all the top institutions of power under the conservatives\u2019 control, enabling them to focus on addressing domestic and foreign policy challenges without resistance from their reformist opponents. This does not provide a long-term solution to the Islamic Republic\u2019s ills but narrows the gap between the two lines of authorities for the time being."

    "content": "PRESIDENT VLADIMIR Putin\u2019s State-of-the-Union address to the Federal Assembly lasted an hour and 23 minutes; only 11 minutes were devoted to foreign policy matters while the rest dwelt upon Russia\u2019s socio-economic challenges and issues, in the light of the pandemic. Against the current background of tension with Ukraine and the West, the fact that his tour d\u2019horizon of foreign policy issues was very short and made towards the end of his long speech, indicates that his focus remains on domestic issues. The forthcoming Duma and 2024 presidential elections remain uppermost in his mind. Domestic Challenges From the outset, he paid tribute to the government\u2019s handling of the socio-economic challenges posed by the pandemic, and the role played by medical workers and researchers who developed \u201cthree reliable coronavirus vaccines\u201d. He urged his people to comply with all the recommended health measures and to get vaccinated, while calling on the government to ensure that vaccination was made available everywhere to \u201cachieve the so-called herd immunity by the autumn\u201d. A major consequence of the pandemic was the deterioration of the demographic situation which Putin labelled \u201can emergency\u201d. Russia has laboured under a demographic problem since the fall of the Soviet Union. President Putin also pointed out the need to speed up the introduction of telemedicine, artificial intelligence and new approaches in diagnostics, surgery, rehabilitation and the production of medicines. Social support measures were also outlined by him, noting that direct payments had been made to families bringing up almost 28 million children. He called on the government to \u201cprovide direct support to families with children who are experiencing hardships\u201d and to develop by 1 July 2021, \u201ca comprehensive system of support for families with children. Our goal is to minimise the risk of poverty for such families\u201d. In 2022, what he labelled \u2018social treasury\u2019 principles, would be introduced. In short, all federal benefits, pensions and other social payments and services would be paid in a one-stop mode. His goal was that in three years, \u201cthe vast majority of public and municipal services should be provided to Russian citizens remotely, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, that is, on an ongoing basis\u201d. Education, Science and Technology Some 1,300 new schools for more than a million children would be built, by the end of 2024, in addition to the provision of 16,000 school buses. Classroom teachers had been receiving a monthly addition to their salaries since 2020; an additional 10 billion rubles in the next two years for major repairs and technical equipment of Russia\u2019s pedagogical universities, would also be made. Another \u201ccrucial area\u201d was the planned allocation of 24 billion rubles within the next three years to renovate cultural centres, libraries and museums in rural areas and small historical towns. Other moves include at least 100 universities receiving grants of 100 million rubles or more for opening student technoparks and business incubators, upgrading academic and laboratory facilities, and running training programmes. Until 2024, Russia would allocate 1.63 trillion rubles for civil, including fundamental, research \u2013 to build and maintain the country\u2019s scientific talent. Putin stressed Russia\u2019s need to \u201censure independence in the production of the entire range of vaccines and pharmaceutical substances with the maximum engagement of Russian-made equipment and domestic components.\u201d In the event of another pandemic, it also had to develop its own test systems within four days, and to create an efficacious domestic vaccine and start its mass production. The timeframe for achieving these goals was 2030. Russia also needed new comprehensive approaches to the development of its energy sector, including new solutions for nuclear generation in the promising areas of hydrogen energy and energy storage. To address climate change, Russia must adjust its agriculture, industry, housing and utilities sector and the entire infrastructure; and create a carbon utilisation sector, bring down emissions and introduce strict control and monitoring measures. Economy and Infrastructure President Putin noted that in 2020, over five million jobs were preserved through subsidised loans for wage payments. The government would ensure the recovery of the labour market by the end of 2021 through encouraging entrepreneurial initiatives and stimulating private investments that create new jobs. The government was to present by May 2021, additional proposals to support small and medium-sized businesses. Infrastructure projects in the regions would benefit their inhabitants. To drive home his point, he cited a number of major regional infrastructure projects \u0336 the construction of a northern railway line that would spur the development of the richest resources of the Arctic \u2013 to name just one. The construction industry built over 80 million square metres of housing in 2020, which he called \u201ca good result\u201d; every year, 120 million square metres of housing were being planned. Housing is a major issue in Russia. To boost domestic and foreign tourism, a programme of \u201ceasy loans\u201d would be launched soon to finance the construction and renovation of hotels and other tourist infrastructure. Also e-visas for travel to Russia \u201cwould be available remotely and without undue formalities within a matter of four days in the majority of countries\u201d. In this regard, Putin criticised the tardiness of the federal and regional officials, stressing that \u201cthings must be done on time and projects must be prepared, not just pictures shown to the government\u201d. That was clearly a reflection of not only his frustration with the pace of the projects but also his concern about the possible negative political impact that would have on his standing. Foreign Policy In his short address on foreign policy, and against the background of current tensions with the West, Putin said that \u201cunfriendly moves towards Russia have also continued unabated. \u201cRussia to date had behaved in an extremely restrained and modest manner\u201d, and would prefer not to respond to \u201cunfriendly moves\u201d. It wanted to maintain \u201cgood relations with all those engaged in international communication,\u201d and did \u201cnot want to burn bridges\u201d. However, he warned that if this approach was mistaken for \u201cindifference or weakness\u201d, \u201cthey must know that Russia's response will be asymmetrical, swift and tough\u201d. He added that whoever threatened \u201cthe core interests of our security will regret what they have done in a way they have not regretted anything for a long time\u201d. Seeking to strike a moderate and reasonable tone despite current tensions with the West, he urged Russia\u2019s \u201cpartners once again to discuss the issues related to strategic armaments and to ensuring global stability\u201d. In this regard, since \u201cthe five nuclear countries bear special responsibility\u201d, Putin recalled his proposal in 2020 for \u201ca personal meeting\u201d of the Five Permanent Members of the UN Security Council to be held as soon as possible. Putin\u2019s speech reveals his current preoccupations with domestic challenges. With his political future on his mind, tensions with the West, while dangerous, would not be allowed to interfere with his ambitious goals to develop Russia further and in the process, secure his possible re-election in 2024. His stress on the need for national resilience would help him act tough on foreign policy and the external front. On Victory Day on 9 May, Putin reiterated long-standing charges of perceived rising Russophobia and attempts to rewrite history of the Second World War in the West. That was meant to warn the West of Russia\u2019s determination to defend its national interests."

    "title": "Growing Out of COVID-19: Can New Tools Work?",
    "author(s)": "By Richard Borsuk",
    "date": "No. 055 \u2013 1 April 2021",
    "content": "COVID-19 CONTINUES to ravage Indonesia, Southeast Asia\u2019s biggest economy. Indonesian officials expect a small contraction in 2021\u2019s just-ended first quarter, which would mean a fourth consecutive period of shrinkage \u2013 which has slashed jobs and consumption \u2013 compared with a year earlier. Still, President Joko Widodo should feel upbeat about the longer-term economic outlook based on some developments during the first quarter. Surprising sceptics who have been assuming bureaucratic lethargy, the drafting of implementing rules for bureaucratic reforms under the Omnibus Law, which should help attract investors, was completed on schedule, 90 days after the president signed it. Also, Indonesia launched an ambitious \u201csovereign wealth fund\u201d to draw hefty foreign inflows to build more infrastructure. The United Arab Emirates even pledged US$10 billion for the fund. COVID-19 Cloud However, an ominous cloud still hovers over Indonesia \u2013 and until it dissipates, the recession-hit economy likely will have at best an anaemic recovery that is not strong enough to recreate the millions of jobs lost last year, and create new ones for the millions entering the labour force every year. The cloud, of course, is COVID-19. For the economy to get back on a steady growth track, \u201ccontrol of the pandemic is really, really important,\u201d Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry vice-chair Shinta Kamdani told a recent seminar. In the battle with COVID-19, there were some encouraging developments during the first quarter: in late March, daily new case numbers were around 5,000, less than half those in January. The new health minister gets good marks, unlike the last one. And Indonesia started a massive vaccination campaign, before many developing countries did. But vaccination of the targeted 181.5 million people will take at least two years, rather than the 12 months Jokowi is hoping will be enough for the logistically daunting job. At quarter\u2019s end, more than 10.5 million jabs had been given. COVID-19: Still a Serious Problem But there are worries that case numbers could easily rise again, especially with holidays in May for the end of Ramadan, the Islamic fasting month, when millions in Jakarta traditionally return home to their villages. Last year, Jokowi, as the president is also known, flip-flopped on policy toward the movement called \u201cmudik\u201d, and cases shot up post-holiday. This year, the government has announced a ban on such travel, but there are big questions about how well that can be implemented. Meanwhile, international travel to Indonesia \u2013 vital for its significant tourism business and for attracting new investors \u2013 probably cannot restart for a long time. COVID-19 \u201cremains a serious problem\u201d, declares Pandu Riono, an epidemiologist at the University of Indonesia. He has long maintained testing is inadequate, and he believes that the real death toll may be double or even triple the official number, which recently topped 40,000. Traffic in Jakarta is close to normal, but not as jammed as the pre-pandemic days, so far. That\u2019s a sign of continued weakness in consumption \u2013 and consumption is what drives growth in Indonesia, as it accounts for about 60% of GDP. January\u2019s case-spike hurt consumption, which is a main reason the economy likely did not grow in January-March (the result is scheduled to be reported on 5 May). If the second quarter brings a sustainable fall in coronavirus cases, that will boost consumption and the growth rate. Overtaken by Vietnam? Economist Muhamad Chatib Basri, finance minister under Jokowi\u2019s predecessor, predicts there could be year-on-year growth of 6% in April-June, which sounds encouraging but stems from a very low base for comparison. In 2020\u2019s second quarter, with the pandemic raging, the economy contracted 5.32%, the worst result since 1998, when the Asian financial crisis raged and President Suharto fell from power after devastating riots in Jakarta. Basri sees 4% growth for full-year 2021 growth, compared with last year\u2019s -2.1%, though still below pre-COVID-19 annual levels of 5%. \u201cEconomic recovery depends so much on vaccination,\u201d he says. \u201cWith COVID-19 there, the economy can\u2019t operate at 100%.\u201d Jokowi, concerned that Vietnam has been far more attractive to investors than Indonesia for years, is counting on the Omnibus Law to attract companies and boost economic recovery. The changes it is bringing to cut red tape are due to be rolled out in July. \u201cIndonesia is very much known for over-regulation,\u201d says Kamdani, the chamber of commerce vice-chair. \u201cThis is a major step if implemented property\u2026 we\u2019re trying to be more competitive.\u201d Douglas Ramage, Indonesia managing director of business advisory firm BGA, says while some officials are \u201cwildly optimistic\u201d on what the Omnibus Law can do, Indonesia \u201cis on the right track. For companies used to Indonesia being hard work, they can see it\u2019s less (hard) now\u201d. INA: Details Still to be Worked Out The other tool Jokowi is counting on for an economic boost \u2013 and it was part of the law \u2013 is the newly-formed wealth fund, known as the Indonesia Investment Authority (INA). It is misnamed as a wealth fund, as this will depend mostly on foreign entities and institutional investors putting up money to co-invest in Indonesian infrastructure projects. Many details need to be worked out on how it will function, which is largely as an asset manager. Announcement of the fund was greeted with hefty scepticism, but that diminished when Jokowi appointed credible, well-respected individuals as its directors and supervisors. Announcement of the big UAE pledge further raised hopes. There still will be scepticism because infrastructure work is largely done by state- owned companies (SOEs), many of which have heavy debt-loads and less-than- sterling reputations. An economic survey on Indonesia published by the Paris-based Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in March called the SOEs \u201comnipresent and powerful\u201d. It said their financial and operational performance has \u201cexperienced a trend deterioration in recent years, which the current crisis (COVID-19) is further aggravating\u201d. The Omnibus Law and INA should produce gains for Indonesia, but don\u2019t look for quick ones. Due to the pandemic, Basri notes, \u201ceven people interested in investing in Indonesia cannot come at present\u201d."

    "title": "4IR: The RMA We Are Finally Looking For?",
    "author(s)": "By Richard A. Bitzinger",
    "date": "No. 017 \u2013 1 February 2021",
    "content": "THE BASEBALL player/philosopher Yogi Berra once said: \u201cIt's tough to make predictions, especially about the future.\u201d Yet it is the burden of analysts to at least attempt prognostication. In this case especially, defence analysts and experts are often compelled to extrapolate from trendlines in military innovation to basically predict future developments. Few chores are more difficult. The past is littered with failed predictions, and so it is easy to become jaded and cynical. Yet, when it comes to envisaging future advances in military innovation \u2013 and, subsequently, future areas of military capability and advantage \u2013 few requirements are more critical. We care about \u201crevolutions in military affairs\u201d (RMAs), because we ignore them at our peril. It is doubly difficult when we realise that we are not only attempting to predict RMAs but to actualise them as well. RMAs and Central Role of Technology RMAs are, of course, much more than \u201cmere\u201d technology. RMAs also entail \u201cinnovative operational concepts\u201d and \u201corganisational adaptation,\u201d executed in a such a way as to fundamentally alter the character and conduct of warfighting and produce a significant increase in the military potential and effectiveness of armed forces. Above all, an RMA is supposed to be a process of discontinuous and disruptive change in modes of warfare. Nevertheless, technology and technological innovation is what we always come back to. Mostly this is because technological advances are central to implementing the organisational, operational, and doctrinal aspects of the RMA. The RMA advanced by \u201ctransformationauts\u201d in the 1990s and 2000s was predicated on the so-called the third industrial revolution (3IR) \u2013 the information revolution in which we exist and operate today. (The first industrial revolution, which began in the late 18th century, was the age of steam and iron, exemplified by the first mechanised industries, railroads, telegraph, and the like; this was superseded in the late 19th century by the second industrial revolution, the age of steel, oil, electricity, and the internal combustion engine.) The 3IR began roughly in the early 1950s with the invention of the transistor and integrated circuitry, leading seamlessly to the microchip, personal computers, wireless communications, and the internet. This information-technologies (IT) RMA was supposed to deliver military superiority in three ways: information dominance, the networking of military forces, and long-range precision-strike. Sadly, the IT-RMA overpromised and undelivered. In particular, there was no great disruptive change in how militaries fight, but rather a cautious, evolutionary process of change. Enter 4IR: AI & Offensive Combat Systems Now we supposedly stand on the cusp of a fourth industrial revolution (4IR), comprising artificial intelligence (AI) and machine-learning, man-machine interfacing, automation and robotics, quantum computing, and the \u201cInternet of Things\u201d (IoT). AI, together with quantum computing, can assist humans when it comes to collecting, processing, and interpreting the large amounts of data being collected by new and more capable sensors, in order to help produce actionable intelligence. The IoT and the cloud, in turn, permit data to be safely stored and accessed from anywhere with Internet access, at any time. As such, the 4IR is about connectivity, permitting users to access vast amounts of data collected from constantly connected sources, powered by AI. AI and quantum computing could power new sensor technologies and provide the massive computing power necessary to interpret large amounts of data coming in from a wide variety of sensors and other resources, as well as enhancing datalinks that would provide shared situational awareness, ideally in real-time. Moreover, the 4IR will likely drive further development in the area of offensive combat systems. In particular, AI, combined with autonomous systems, could craft a new breed of armed drones, capable of swarmed and coordinated attacks, and able to operate in uncertain or changing combat environments. Overall, the 4IR could have a dramatic impact on operational capabilities. As noted by Diego Ruiz Palmer, a NATO special advisor, \u201cadvances in precision location, targeting and strike, navigation, large data transmission and discrimination, and weapon-system range and manoeuvrability, as well as the growing importance of the outer space and cyber domains\u201d are collectively altering \u201cthe spatial dimensions\u201d of warfare. The Futurist\u2019s Caveats: Domain of the Few There still exist high barriers to spin-on, especially in countries with weak military R&D infrastructures. In fact, most militaries are still stuck in the \u201cmetal-bashing\u201d second industrial revolution, and even the digital revolution of the 3IR eludes them. Nor should one expect the 4IR to create immediately \u201cgame-changing\u201d weapons that will quickly affect military balances. Progress in AI or other 4IR technologies could eventually result in some impressive breakthroughs, but these will likely take decades for their impacts to be felt. Nevertheless, smaller states may still be able to cherry-pick the 4IR to gain specific new capacities and, therefore, possible new areas of military benefit and leverage. In particular, the growing ubiquity of unmanned systems, especially armed aerial drones or underwater systems, coupled with deployments like swarming, could create asymmetric advantages for smaller or less-developed militaries. In this context, the potential of a 4IR-based military contest between China and the United States is increasingly possible, and growing more complex and worrisome. Both countries are keen to exploit the 4IR for military advantage. Artificial Intelligence-RMA: What We\u2019ve Been Looking For? Michael Raska, in his recent article on \u201cThe Sixth RMA Wave\u201d (Journal of Strategic Studies, November 2020), argues that we are in the midst of a new \u201cartificial intelligence-driven RMA\u201d that differs greatly from previous RMAs. If so, then we might be finally getting the RMA we have been looking for. In this regard, technology is still a crucial determinant of military effectiveness, and consequently harnessing the latest technology is still critical to military success and advantage. And if we are indeed, in a 4IR, then we must be prepared to identify and harness its promise and power."

    "title": "HADR in Southeast Asia: Unpacking the Military\u2019s Humanitarian Role",
    "author(s)": "By Angelo Paolo Trias and Alistair D.B. Cook",
    "date": "No. 184 \u2013 23 October 2020",
    "content": "DISASTERS ARE becoming increasingly intense and uncertain in our new climate reality. The growing linkages between natural and human-induced hazards in a more interconnected world are generating greater risks that can overwhelm national capacities and worsen transboundary effects. ASEAN states continue to invest in building national and regional emergency and disaster risk management (DRM) systems to adapt to this. Despite stronger civilian coping mechanisms, militaries continue to be the primary responders of ASEAN states during crises and calamities. Defence forces are also among the first to be mobilised when governments send or receive humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR). We observe this in the 2017 Marawi conflict, the 2018 Central Sulawesi tsunami, and the current COVID-19 pandemic. Centrality of Southeast Asian Militaries The centrality of Southeast Asian militaries therefore means that efforts to improve regional crisis response and disaster governance cannot fully succeed without military cooperation. Cooperating with militaries, in policy or practice, requires an understanding of the social networks they are part of and the nature of their ties in emergency and disaster contexts. Yet there is a shortage of studies outside of military institutions that generate such insights. Where should we begin? What civilians generally know about militaries in emergencies and disasters are driven by two developments: technological advancements and growing acceptance of military engagement in response to natural hazards and human-induced disasters like conflicts to pandemics. Access to more powerful mobile devices and information sharing platforms make large amounts of emergency and DRM data more available to the public. Datasets can give us a clearer picture not only of who is doing what, but also where and when they are doing it. As a result, our ways of tracking and assessing resources and activities in emergencies and disasters, including foreign military assets (FMA) like those deployed in Indonesia and the Philippines have improved. Militaries have the equipment and skills to quickly deploy strategic airlifts like C-130s that can transport and operate in hard-to-reach and chaotic disaster contexts. Our increasing knowledge about what militaries can contribute and how they can support civilian responders and aid workers made it possible to structure practices for humanitarian civil-military coordination (CMCoord). The Missing Pieces Military HADR missions are becoming more common in many parts of the world, and CMCoord is gaining traction, especially in the Asia-Pacific. However, there is still a lot we do not know about military engagement in emergencies and disasters. There are three key reasons behind this: narrow data processing, misjudgments about HADR missions, and emerging security competition by proxy. Mainstream emergency and DRM data processing strongly focus on operational tasks of traditional systems like civilian-led clusters. This eases coordination because it highlights the general needs of the response rather than individual differences of those providing aid. Yet it provides inadequate information on other actors such as the military that work independently of, alongside, or with such systems. HADR activities can assist in saving lives and alleviating suffering. It can also enhance confidence-building and interoperability between militaries. But it is essentially a military mission driven by other factors like defence capabilities, domestic politics, and foreign policy. HADR enables assisting states to show good governance, flex military might, and project technological superiority that allow rivalries to play out. The military-political- security dimensions of HADR make it challenging for militaries to share information deemed sensitive. Linking the Parts, Revealing the Whole Militaries are vital to emergency and DRM activities in Southeast Asia. So how can the public increase its oversight and understanding of HADR missions to improve its governance for the benefit of affected communities? One way to address this research gap affecting policy and practice is to assess military HADR networks and see how they shape and influence regional aid and responses. To contribute to this end, RSIS' HADR Programme launched a Database Project that explores the web of relations that link together militaries involved in HADR in Southeast Asia. Using opensource data and network analysis, it examines the social structures and nature of individual ties to gain insight into HADR governance. ASEAN states have many differences but there is consensus that they can accomplish more together than they can apart. So far, they have remained committed to developing institutions and strategies for a more secure and stable region. This includes the alignment of different mechanisms and tools to facilitate joint HADR missions like the ASEAN Regional Forum, Regional Standby Arrangements (SASOP), Regional Emergency Response Simulation Exercise (ARDEX), and Exercise Coordinated Response (ExCOORES), to name a few. One ASEAN One Response? ASEAN\u2019s progress in emergency and DRM have led to a grander \u201cOne ASEAN One Response\u201d (OAOR) vision to move towards faster and collective responses to disasters inside and outside the region. The HADR Database Project aims to investigate who the key actors are in the HADR network, how they are connected, and what patterns emerge from their interactions like the supply or transfer of assets used for HADR, and coordination and hosting of HADR exercises. Studying these activities can show the points of convergence or divergence that support or constrain the efficient use of available HADR resources besides regional standby arrangements. It also presents alternative pathways for achieving shared HADR objectives beyond existing cooperation platforms. We cannot completely harness the individual and collective strengths of different sectors and stakeholders in ASEAN unless we have a better understanding of their resources, expertise, and capabilities first. The HADR Database Project begins this effort by studying the ways militaries are interconnecting among themselves and other actors in the HADR network."

    "title": "Global Health Security Malaysia\u2019s COVID-19 Strategy",
    "author(s)": "By Jose Ricardo Sto. Domingo",
    "date": "No. 052 \u2013 27 March 2020",
    "content": "ON 12 MARCH 2020, the World Health Organisation declared COVID-19 a pandemic, with the coronavirus running rampant across many parts of the West. Meanwhile, after what seemed to be a slowdown in February, Southeast Asian countries began to experience a \u201csecond wave\u201d of COVID-19 infections, in Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Malaysia. Malaysia suffered a spike of cases arising from the Sri Petaling Tabligh religious gathering outside of Kuala Lumpur from 28 February to 2 March. The event was reportedly attended by 16,000 participants including 1,500 foreigners, resulting in the largest known cluster of COVID-19 infections with 1,117 cases testing positive so far. To date, Malaysia has more than 2,000 confirmed cases as of 26 March, the most among ASEAN countries. Critically, 80 health ministry staff members have been infected. The Movement Control Order The government announced the Movement Control Order (MCO) about a week and a half after the Tabligh event, only after a steady increase of cases were discovered. It restricted movement within, and out of the country, banned mass gatherings, and stopped all non-essential services. The sudden announcement was criticised for its timing and unclear guidelines, which caused unnecessary crowds at police stations and public transit as well as panic buying at groceries and supermarkets. Nevertheless, the MCO was imposed to prevent a repeat of the Tabligh event. It makes tracking and monitoring of potential cases easier. Six days after the MCO commenced, it was announced that the military would be deployed due to less than satisfactory public compliance. This was a step to bring on board the military\u2019s manpower and competence in large- scale planning, organisation and logistical support. The MCO has also been extended from 31 March to 14 April. Tighter controls are being imposed due to high infection rates, with two areas in the state of Johor having just been put under complete lockdown. Another extension would not be a surprise as market reports indicate the peak infection rate for Malaysia will come around mid-April and could possibly last for two more weeks, reaching an estimated 6,300 total cases. The mishandled announcement of the MCO could be attributed to the new Perikatan Nasional (PN) government just getting organised. The lull in reported new coronavirus cases between 16 \u2013 27 February along with the political coup known as the \u2018Sheraton Move\u2019 from 23 February to 2 March may have also contributed to the lack of government focus on COVID-19. Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin only swore in new ministers on 10 March, so there could have been a lack of direction and planning for more than two weeks. MCO Extension PM Muhyiddin\u2019s early announcement on 25 March that the MCO has been extended to 14 April is a sign that the government has learned from experience and is giving the people more advance notice. Policies governing the MCO are the responsibility of the National Security Council (NSC), chaired by the prime minister. Under the previous Pakatan Harapan (PH) government, then Deputy Prime Minister Wan Azizah was the Chairman of the Disaster Management Centre Committee and would make the key government announcements on COVID-19. Under PN, apart from the prime minister, various senior ministers have made policy statements on the matter, as have relevant ministers. (PM Muhyiddin had resisted pressures to appoint a DPM among the coalition parties, and instead appointed four \u201csenior ministers\u201d from different parties.) To improve coordination among the different ministries during the MCO, the government has created a special ministerial committee, headed by Senior Minister Ismail Sabri. This has helped to streamline government communications to some degree. Under Control, but Problems Exist Malaysia\u2019s public institutions and experienced public servants in the Health Ministry and other departments have handled the COVID-19 situation relatively well. Despite currently having the highest number of cases in Southeast Asia, its death rate at 1.1% has been relatively low compared to Indonesia and the Philippines. Its higher numbers reflect its more extensive testing. The government has shown that it has the capacity and resources available to handle the matter so far. The MOH has designated hospitals and areas to focus on COVID-19 and plans to emulate South Korea\u2019s strategy of mass testing. 34% of Malaysian hospital beds dedicated to COVID-19 patients are being utilised, with 3,585 more ready. Putrajaya has also allocated an additional RM600 million (SGD200 million) to the MOH for equipment and personnel against COVID-19. Putrajaya has also shown a willingness to cooperate with close neighbour, Singapore. An estimated 300,000 Malaysian workers who commute daily between the two countries were affected by the sudden MCO announcement. The Causeway and Second Link connect both countries, supporting an important supply line of food, goods and services. The sudden announcement drove people to rush back into both countries. Coordination from both governments under PM Muhyiddin and PM Lee Hsien Loong, as well as Singapore Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean and Senior Minister Ismail Sabri, have since brought more clarity to the situation. A Joint Committee with three working groups serves to facilitate the movement of people, and goods at the borders. Economic Challenges The MCO, and its extension, present serious challenges to an already battered economy headed for technical recession. Initially, to support the flagging economy, the central bank, Bank Negara Malaysia, had cut interest rates and the then PH government had announced a RM20 billion (SGD 6.7 billion) stimulus package. Today, that is not enough as the new PN government must now also support its citizens affected by the MCO. Though supply lines remain open, food production may become a problem, and jobs and wages are at risk, especially for those in the informal sector. It has been two weeks of people staying at home and non-essential businesses remaining closed, and the extension will strain resources further. Amidst rising calls from the public and the Opposition for more help for the people, PM Muhyiddin has pushed forward the unveiling of a second stimulus package from 30 March to 27 March. The central bank has announced a six-month moratorium on loan repayment by individuals and small businesses. The government has also allowed Malaysians to withdraw monthly RM500 (SGD167) from their Employees Provident Fund (EPF) accounts. This has been criticised for neglecting those without sufficient EPF savings and its negative effects on workers\u2019 retirement savings. It would be wise for the PN government to include cash injections for both individuals and SMEs, and help provide social safety nets for Malaysians caught in the economic fallout. This would help to sustain the real economy and maintain social order as the MCO drags on. Malaysia Post-COVID-19 Malaysia has sought to leverage its warm relations with partners such as China and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), with Foreign Minister Hishammuddin Hussein saying that his ministry has been speaking with foreign governments for medical assistance. Malaysia has sought to handle China sensitively since the start of the infection in January. It had imposed limited travel restrictions on China in late January and announced that it was sending 18 million pieces of medical gloves, and protective clothing. China has warmly reciprocated with donations just as Malaysia is experiencing its own spike. This positive dynamic bodes well for Malaysia, which can expect more Chinese investments and trade once the pandemic settles down. COVID-19 will test the ability of PM Muhyiddin and his PN coalition to manage the country\u2019s economic and political challenges going forward. It could make or break the coalition\u2019s chances in the next general election."

    "content": "EAST ASIAN countries have suffered from the spread of COVID-19. At the time of this writing, the numbers of confirmed cases and fatalities exceeded 345,000 and 12,500 respectively. Their economies are not spared either. The ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Office (AMRO) that represents the ASEAN 10 as well as China, Japan and South Korea estimated that most regional economies will experience a negative growth this year. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted that East Asia\u2019s 2020 GDP to be - 0.2 percent. The virus situation has yet to abate as some nations such as Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam are facing a new wave of contagion. Against this backdrop, the ASEAN+3 governments have made a laudable effort not only to cope with the adverse impacts of the virus but also prepare the region to better weather the subsequent waves. To this end, the Special ASEAN+3 Summit on COVID-19 was convened virtually in April 2020. Commendable Follow-Up Moves According to their Joint Statement, the Leaders discussed ways to enhance cooperation on managing the effects of the virus. They also tasked their foreign ministers to function as the main coordinating body \u201cto monitor the implementation of the commitments and agreements\u201d. In June, their economic ministers gathered online and pledged to transform \u201cthe Leaders\u2019 directive into concrete actions\u201d. For instance, they agreed to uphold the open economic system to strengthen the resiliency and sustainability of regional supply chains. They also agreed to refrain from taking unnecessary measures that may affect the smooth flow of essential goods such as food, commodities, medicines and medical supplies in the region. In addition, the governments undertook to exchange data on the production and trade of essential medical supplies to support the initiative towards developing regional stockpiling of such goods. The other promises include supporting essential international labour movements, leveraging on technology and e-commerce to help micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and encouraging the sharing of best practices in managing the undesired consequences of the virus on economies. Necessary But Missing Parts The follow-up work by the ASEAN+3 Economic Ministers deserves commendation. For one thing, it indicated that East Asian countries are working together to bolster regional economic resilience and sustain transnational supply chains. However, there exist some missing pieces necessary to achieve these objectives. First, concerning essential medical goods, a pledge to exchange production and trade information is a step in the right direction. Nevertheless, the ASEAN+3 governments should share the data on the consumption of these goods. Adding the \u201cdemand side\u201d information into the picture would not only allow companies to better gauge the market conditions and plan ahead, but also boost the region\u2019s responsiveness to the virus- afflicted landscape. To elaborate, the data would allow firms to know better which medical products are over- and under-supplied, and thus reallocate their resources to produce items that are in demand to fill the orders in the markets. Second, the Joint Statement indicated that the ASEAN+3 authorities did not emphasise collaboration in the investment area as much as in the trade one. For example, the word \u201cinvestment\u201d appeared only twice in the text while the term \u201ctrade\u201d was referred to 11 times. This is a mistake. Cross-border investment is an essential but often ignored part of transnational production networks. In other words, it is usually the case that money or investment goes first into the country to set up production facilities, and then trade (characterised by the supply chains) emerges and grows. Thus, if governments are serious about sustaining the regional production networks and augmenting regional economic resiliency, they must work together to enhance international investment flows. Need for Policy Adjustment Finally, while the Joint Statement alluded to the future prospects of collaborating on investment promotion among the ASEAN+3 countries, such a move is inadequate to boost international investment and economic resiliency. This is because it neglects the other two aspects of investment \u2013 liberalisation and protection. For instance, governments need to work together to liberalise investment by lowering or eliminating foreign investment restrictions. Moreover, the authorities must coin or amend domestic rules to better protect foreign investment in the region. Without doing so, foreign entities may not have high confidence in putting their monies into national economies, stunting regional investment flows and supply chain resiliency. Admittedly, implementing these elements above may be daunting. Doing so requires policy adjustments which have domestic political implications. For example, lifting barriers on foreign investment may render some local companies less competitive in the international markets, leading to shutdowns and layoffs. These consequences can increase the unpopularity of some regimes and trigger election losses. Yet, no single government can manage the adverse effects of this crisis alone. Hence, international cooperation is needed more than ever, even if accompanied by some domestic costs."

    "title": "Global Health Security ASEAN-China COVID-19 Meeting: Why and What\u2019s Next?",
    "author(s)": "By Zi Yang",
    "date": "No. 032 \u2013 28 February 2020",
    "content": "ON 20 FEBRUARY 2020, ASEAN and China held the first Special ASEAN-China Foreign Ministers\u2019 Meeting on COVID-19 in Vientiane, Laos that sought to coordinate a unified ASEAN-China response to the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic that now has all features of a global pandemic. During the meeting, China\u2019s Foreign Minister Wang Yi made four proposals \u2014 enhance inter-agency response; set-up permanent public health cooperation mechanisms; be prepared to lift trade and travel restrictions; and foster new areas of cooperation amid the epidemic. Wang\u2019s proposals were received positively by ASEAN counterparts. Factors Behind the Meeting According to the meeting\u2019s joint statement, ASEAN and China promised to increase information sharing and communications, strengthen cooperation mechanisms, expand policy dialogue, build disease prevention and control capacity, support businesses affected by the epidemic, \u201cmitigate supply chain disruptions of urgent medical goods and promote research and development of medicines and vaccines\u201d. Some two months after the outbreak began, China finally held the first meeting with ASEAN, the largest multi-nation bloc in China\u2019s neighborhood. Although we are not sure why it took so long for China\u2019s foreign minister to meet ASEAN counterparts, the results of the meeting were clearly positive. Still, it is necessary for us to grasp the circumstances that led to the meeting, so we could better understand the future trajectory of ASEAN-China cooperation in combating COVID-19. Two major factors contributed to the realisation of the meeting. One deals with national security of ASEAN states, the other is mutual economic interest. The Security Factor COVID-19 is a highly contagious virus with an unpredictable profile. In a recent speech, Chinese President Xi Jinping confirmed that COVID-19 \u201chas the fastest transmission, widest range of infection and has been the most difficult to prevent and control\u201d. Unlike SARS, the source and transmission patterns of COVID-19 have not been completely understood. Thus, COVID-19 is comparatively more difficult to contain. The surprise rise of infections in South Korea, Italy, and Iran of the past several days are testaments to mounting challenges in global containment efforts. So far, COVID-19 has already surpassed SARS in infected cases and death toll, all within a shorter time frame. With porous borders and heavy international traffic, Southeast Asian countries are especially vulnerable to the epidemic, leading to a number of ASEAN countries taking strict protective measures, with Singapore, the Philippines, and Indonesia being the most stringent in limiting visitors with recent travel history to Mainland China. Currently, six out of 10 ASEAN states have reported COVID-19 cases, out of which Singapore has the highest of 93 cases, of which 62 have fully recovered. With that being said, ASEAN countries cannot return to normalcy when the epicentre of the initial outbreak remains very much active and ASEAN states are helping themselves by contributing to China\u2019s containment effort. Mutual Economic Interest Besides security, common economic interest also brought ASEAN and China together. At the crossroads of international commerce, Southeast Asia is a main investment destination for China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). And in recent years trade between ASEAN and China has been expanding exponentially. Merchandise trade with China reached US$479.4 billion in 2018, or 17.1 percent of ASEAN\u2019s total merchandise trade. In addition, China has been ASEAN\u2019s largest trade partner since 2009. In 2018, China provided the third-largest amount of foreign direct investment to ASEAN and the country produced the largest number of tourists to four ASEAN countries. COVID-19 is extremely disruptive to commerce. Both China and ASEAN countries are forecasting much slower economic growth this year with billions of dollars in economic losses due to disruption in trade, travel, and investment. According to Morgan Stanley\u2019s assessment, China\u2019s first quarter growth could slow to 3.5 percent if COVID- 19 is not properly contained. In the meantime, Singapore has downgraded its 2020 growth to between -0.5 percent and 1.5 percent, a reflection of regional ill fortunes. As commonly known, economic troubles could amplify problems in other sectors. Therefore, it is in the interest of both ASEAN and China to join hands and bring an end to the epidemic as soon as possible. Meeting\u2019s Impact on COVID-19 Containment While the Vientiane meeting ended on a high note with words of mutual support and confidence in overcoming difficulties together, President Xi struck quite a different tone to Foreign Minister Wang\u2019s promising words. Three days after the ASEAN-China meeting, Xi gave a speech calling the COVID-19 epidemic the \u201clargest public health emergency\u201d since the People\u2019s Republic\u2019s founding and called the crisis a \u201cbig test\u201d for the government. Xi\u2019s statement, in addition to rising infections in several countries, show that COVID- 19 will have lasting global impact and its containment demands coordinated international action. For ASEAN countries, the Vientiane meeting is comparable to the April 2003 Bangkok meeting, when Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao met ASEAN counterparts and devised plans to jointly combat SARS. The Vientiane meeting could mark a new beginning for ASEAN-China public health cooperation. Besides utilising existing mechanisms such as ASEAN-China Health Ministers\u2019 Meeting and the ASEAN-China Senior Officials\u2019 Meeting on Health Development to \u201cfully implement the ASEAN-China MOU on Health Cooperation and support more mutually agreed cooperation projects\u201d, we will likely witness changes in three areas. Three Key Impacts First of all, according to the Chinese foreign minister, China seeks to hold a Special China-ASEAN Leaders\u2019 Meeting on COVID-19, in addition to establishing a China- ASEAN public health liaison group, and reserve centers for epidemic-control provisions. Thus, we will see the formation of new mechanisms in the coming months. Second, besides meeting between high-level government officials, there will be more coordination between Chinese and ASEAN medical professionals in sharing information regarding the COVID-19 containment, research, and treatment. Finally, ASEAN will accelerate aid to China. ASEAN governments and civil society organizations were sending aid to China before the meeting and such trend will likely gain momentum. In fact, the day after the Vientiane meeting, Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Defence delivered some 2,000 kg of essential medical supplies such as N95 masks, safety goggles, and medical handwash to China\u2019s military hospitals that are actively engaged in containment at Wuhan city and Hubei province. Although the official meeting to coordinate ASEAN-China COVID-19 containment could have happened earlier, the recent meeting in Vientiane is a positive sign for both parties\u2019 public health cooperation. Overall, this is an important milestone for what is shaping up to be a long fight for the global community."

    "author(s)": "By Frederick Kliem",
    "date": "No. 021 \u2013 4 February 2020",
    "content": "VIETNAM IS chairing ASEAN this year, something it has done with notable success twice before - 1998 and 2010. In 2010, Vietnam inaugurated the ADMM-Plus (ASEAN Defence Ministers Meeting Plus) and extended East Asia Summit (EAS) membership to the United States. Given Vietnam\u2019s diplomatic experience and multilateral pro- activism, there is a large degree of optimism regarding Vietnam\u2019s ASEAN Chairmanship in its 25th membership year under the theme \u201cCohesive and Responsive\u201d. Vietnam faces a dense diplomatic schedule, with the chairmanship coinciding with Vietnam\u2019s non-permanent membership of the UN Security Council. This poses logistical challenges for the country. But this dual diplomatic responsibility also offers a rare opportunity for Hanoi to present a well-coordinated foreign policy and achieve maximum impact. In particular, Hanoi should leverage the ASEAN agenda at the global stage at the UN, something previous ASEAN chairs have done with remarkable success. Cohesive and Responsive Hanoi will continue to build on the work and specific initiatives of previous chairs, such as developing smart cities. But they will also be cognizant of the need for any ASEAN chair to produce key deliverables of interests to the chairing country itself. Both thematic elements apply across all pillars of the ASEAN Community. \u201cCohesiveness\u201d symbolises ASEAN\u2019s unity and solidarity in the face of internal and external challenges, to further economic integration, and to raise public ASEAN awareness. \u201cResponsiveness\u201d is Hanoi\u2019s wish to promote greater ASEAN pro-activism in order to be a defender of regional interests in the face of crises. Five Priorities Vietnam has specified five key priorities: First, in order to be responsive, Hanoi will work towards strengthening ASEAN solidarity and unity in order to effectively and punctually address challenges and trends. Second, Vietnam intends to deepen ASEAN integration economically, by raising intra- ASEAN trade and investment levels, and leveraging the Fourth Industrial Revolution, in order to alleviate inequality. Third, Hanoi will promote a greater sense of a collective ASEAN identity and awareness, by encouraging the development of common ASEAN values, joint events and programmes, and broadening ASEAN education locally in each member country. Fourth, the 2020 chair will continue to strengthen good relations with ASEAN\u2019s external partners and seek to extend this network. Lastly, Vietnam will strongly highlight the need to improve ASEAN\u2019s institutional capacity. It plans to conduct a thorough review of the effectiveness of ASEAN\u2019s organisational structure and its operations. Its goal is to identify weaknesses and hurdles and reform ASEAN\u2019s operational methods and procedures to make the group more responsive and pro-active. Enhancing cross-sectoral and cross-pillar coordination and cooperation is a priority. So it is with procedural reform. While Hanoi believes ASEAN must uphold the consensus principle, it will develop a method to apply the ASEAN-X mechanism case-by-case on the basis of ASEAN-wide consensus. In other words, Vietnam seeks a way to find unanimous support across all ten capitals for applying ASEAN-X to very specific issues and questions across all pillars whenever unanimous ASEAN progress is not possible. Pertaining to organisational questions, Vietnam plans to set an example for alleviating the chair\u2019s hosting duties as well as for enhancing the role of the ASEAN Secretariat (ASEC) by organising more ASEAN meetings at the new ASEC building in Jakarta. Three Key Points to Watch Vietnam may attempt to set new directions for ASEAN-led mechanisms, including the EAS and ADMM and there will be efforts to advance cross-sectoral and cross-pillar approaches to better coordinate and tackle emerging security challenges within these forums. Within the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) pillar, Vietnam will seek to promote specific intra-ASEAN partnerships for sustainable development in order to boost intra- ASEAN trade and investment, and ASEAN sustainability measures. Under the ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community (ASCC), Hanoi will try to raise ASEAN awareness by seeking to enhance social security for the most vulnerable ASEAN citizens, to promote cooperation mechanisms to combat fake news, and raise the idea to place the ASEAN symbol on passports. Three Off-the-Radar Items to Watch In addition to the above agenda items, there will be several off-the-radar issues and flashpoints to watch. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) will receive particular attention and may become a concrete deliverable for Vietnam, after Thailand failed to put the seal on a pact that includes India. Second, although several officials have assured member states that Vietnam will not hijack the ASEAN agenda by placing the South China Sea at the centre of its chairmanship, it will remain a flashpoint given Vietnam\u2019s key role and recent Sino- Vietnamese tensions. The extent to which this will feature on the 2020 agenda will largely depend on either the restraint or assertiveness of China. But it would be desirable to reserve this issue for retreats and informal discussions. Lastly, the behaviour of the United States is worth observing. The Trump administration\u2019s engagement of ASEAN has been disappointingly low, and in 2020, the president is unlikely to attend the EAS, as it will coincide with the presidential elections. However, Washington may be incentivised to meet ASEAN leaders in a special US-ASEAN summit or otherwise, which would mitigate Trump\u2019s assaults on Asian multilateralism. Given Vietnam\u2019s increasingly active role on the global stage and within ASEAN, as well as the challenging regional environment and difficult issues, there will be much to observe in ASEAN in 2020 and Vietnam is uniquely well placed to move ASEAN forward."

    "author(s)": "By Kaewkamol Pitakdumrongkit",
    "date": "No. 104 \u2013 26 May 2020",
    "content": "THE COVID-19 pandemic has caused rising uncertainties and risks in the global economy. This resulted in capital flight from emerging economies as investors move their funds to safer places such as advanced economies or to safer currencies such as the United States dollar. For example, the International Monetary Fund\u2019s Global Financial Stability Report released in April 2020 found that since January 2020, emerging markets have witnessed sharp portfolio outflows of more than US$100 billion. This amount accounts for 0.4 percent of their GDP. Among the emerging markets, the outflows from emerging Asia, with several East Asian countries included, are the greatest. Effects on Regional Economies Why do we need to care about this capital flight? A short answer is that it begets several adverse impacts on regional economies. First, the financial exodus can dry up capital in a country, resulting in a credit crunch. Firms can no longer borrow and pay debts. Companies having foreign-denominated debts (especially in the US dollar) face higher debt service burdens as the greenback appreciates. They could ultimately default, exacerbating unemployment and economic hardship of the people. Second, the scale of this capital flight is larger than that which occurred in the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2007-2008, rendering the damage on affected economies more severe. Third, the outflow poses a risk of regional financial instability which can cause a crisis in itself. The capital flight from only a few countries could cause financial panic in the region. The scenes from the Asian Financial Crisis (AFC) of 1997-1998 may recur. Unsurprisingly, the ASEAN+3 governments mentioned such risk in the Joint Statement of the Special ASEAN+3 Summit on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) convened virtually on 14 April 2020. Action More Than Words Needed The region does not lack institutional structures to help regional states survive this difficult time. In fact, the ASEAN+3 financial cooperation process was set up in 1997 to address problems triggered by the AFC. The leaders at the Special ASEAN+3 Summit supported this mechanism. They pledged to foster closer regional financial cooperation and policy coordination and support the ASEAN Plus Three Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) in its monitoring role of the economic and financial development in the region. They also reaffirmed their commitment to the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation (CMIM) \u201cas a reliable layer of the Global Financial Safety Net\". While this pledge is commendable, words should be followed by concrete actions. To lessen the potential risk of regional financial instability and help East Asian nations better cope with the negative economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments should consider enhancing the ASEAN+3 financial cooperation process in the following ways. Give More Clout to ASEAN+3 Financial Cooperation Process First, they should expand the CMIM size of currency swap networks, which is currently at US$240 billion. While critics may argue that $240 billion pales in comparison to the amount of funds required to keep the economies afloat, increasing the size can send signals to the markets that these countries are working together. This can hence bolster market confidence and preempt financial panic. the governments should allow AMRO Second, to conduct macroeconomic surveillance more frequently. The entity\u2019s yearly consultation exercises should be adjusted to bi-annually, at least. As AMRO supports CMIM\u2019s decision-making, this action could enable the governments to be better informed about the region\u2019s macroeconomic conditions and use AMRO\u2019s assessments to craft their responses (e.g. activating CMIM swap lines) in a timely fashion. Moreover, the local-currency bond market development under the ASEAN+3 Bond Market Initiative should be further advanced because it would allow firms to raise funds in local currencies instead of borrowing abroad in foreign currencies. As a result, the issue of rising burdens of servicing foreign-denominated debts caused by local currency depreciation could be avoided. Reaffirm Free Trade Commitment Last but not least, governments should reaffirm their commitments to free trade. Because COVID-19 situations vary across nations, some countries which can first contain the virus spread may open up their economies and restart production lines earlier than the others. Those opening up later may be tempted to impose both tariff and non-tariff barriers to protect their domestic producers from losing out in international competition and going out of business. Therefore, bettering a financial sector alone would not suffice in pushing forward regional economies if countries roll out protectionist measures. Admittedly, free trade is not covered formally under the ASEAN+3 financial cooperation framework. However, the governments should seize the opportunity when they convene under this process to jointly pledge to refrain from pursuing trade protectionism. To sum up, the COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented economic challenges to countries around the world. While East Asia is not spared, the region has the ASEAN+3 financial cooperation avenue to help regional states weather this storm. To what extent the mechanism will be effective will depend on the collective action of the governments to turn their words into deeds."

    "title": "Global Health Security: COVID-19 & Its Impacts Pandemic Recovery: No Need For US Leadership?",
    "author(s)": "By Frederick Kliem",
    "date": "No. 135 \u2013 1 July 2020",
    "content": "THE COVID-19 pandemic is turning out to be one of the greatest global crises in living memory. Due to the nature of pandemics, international cooperation is imperative. Traditionally, the United States has played the critical role in managing global crises and marshalling international responses, including HIV/AIDS or the 2014 Ebola outbreak. Now, for the first time in decades, nations around the globe cannot look towards Washington for leadership. The COVID-19 pandemic is the first global crisis in decades in which US leadership has been entirely absent. US Leadership No More US leadership is far from perfect and never altruistic, but it has always been present and, hitherto, necessary to address challenges of such substantial global magnitude. It remains entirely speculative whether COVID-19 will be remembered as the moment when American leadership vanished forever. What is evident, though, is that the current US President Donald Trump has entirely abdicated the leadership role of his predecessors. Instead of offering global support and facilitating multilateral cooperation, Trump has shown to be vastly out of his depth. Trump neglects multilateralism, seeks to sever ties with the World Health Organisation (WHO), and disastrously mismanaged the domestic American response to the pandemic. Rightly or wrongly but certainly unhelpfully, Trump wasted valuable time blaming Beijing for the \u201cChinese virus\u201d, continues to downplay the severity of COVID-19, and led by bad example taking an untested drug publicly. If that was not bad enough leadership, the President of the US undermined state-led efforts to curtail the spread of COVID-19 by voicing support for protesters marching against COVID-19 lockdown measures. Regionalism\u2019s Turnaround COVID-19 requires deeply interconnected nation states to cooperate \u2500 mutually providing aid, sharing information, best practices and lessons learnt, and coordinating both lockdown and reopening of borders and supply chains. And it is mostly the geographical regions where such cooperation is most promising. The two most advanced regional organisations, the European Union and ASEAN, were both slow to react. Initially, regionalism came to a standstill. As soon as the severity of the crisis became evident, member countries switched into full nationalist gear. With unilateral border closures and export bans, unhelpful national self-help dynamics began to unfold in both regions. Yet, the EU has awoken from its initial crisis paralysis with impressive determination, and ASEAN is beginning to catch up, too. EU Solidarity Before COVID-19, it would have been impossible to imagine the extent of institutional failure and lack of solidarity that characterised the EU\u2019s total absence as first crisis responder. But Brussels\u2019 comeback from paralysis has been nothing short of impressive. EU lobbying efforts managed to break the negative self-help spiral across membership, as individual EU members came to each other\u2019s aid, providing consular support and repatriation of each other\u2019s citizens, opening their ICUs to other EU patients and sending medical teams and equipment across the union. The EU Commission and European Central Bank initiated several substantial grant and loan packages to support EU businesses and workers, and the Council are currently discussing an even bigger financial EU instrument. Once all financial support packages are finalised, EU members will channel the largest ever recovery package through the EU, with a size comparable to the GDP of France. Perhaps most important for regionalism as such, however, is the EU\u2019s Joint Roadmap to lift national pandemic-management measures in a coordinated and coherent way. To restore trust in regionalism, it is imperative to coordinate the lifting of national restrictions that were put in place all too hastily and uncoordinatedly, and to design common guidelines for future pandemics. This minimises the detrimental impact on supply chains, trade and free movement. And it can help overcome the negative dynamics of burgeoning unilateralism and restore trust in regionalism\u2019s value-added in lieu of American leadership. ASEAN Centrality 2.0 On 14 April 2020, ASEAN held a special virtual leaders\u2019 summit to develop a COVID- 19 strategy for the region. The summit allowed ASEAN leaders to exchange lessons learnt and better coordinate their responses. ASEAN leaders agreed on a set of measures to combat the virus, including the inauguration of a yet to be specified common COVID-19 response fund to aid economic recovery. ASEAN agreed to work towards extensive sharing of information and best practices, and initiated dialogue on joint cross-border responses to retain the smooth functioning and openness of essential trade routes to protect food security and the exchange of medical equipment. Extending their multilateral approach, ASEAN hosted a video conference with its ASEAN Plus-Three (APT) partners Japan, South Korea and China, all of whom have launched organised, cohesive responses to the pandemic. ASEAN managed to establish pan-East Asian buy-in to their multilateral approach to the crisis, for example securing APT contribution to their response fund. APT leaders also agreed to strengthen real-time information exchange and to set-up an East Asian medical supply stockpile. They committed to ensuring the continuous flow of commodities and medical supplies across Southeast Asia and specifically emphasised the commitment to food security. Regionalism\u2019s Moment The EU and ASEAN are also proving the value of inter-regional networking, as is already taking place with COVID-19 ASEAN-EU virtual ministerial meeting, EU financial support to ASEAN, and upcoming webinars on the topic. Of course, ASEAN and the EU cover only 1.1 billion people. But they can be leading the way for fellow organisations, such as SAARC. The further extension beyond the immediate region to include third countries such as Japan and China shows the tangible value of diplomacy and multilateralism in times of crisis. Regional recovery aside, such multilateral efforts show the path forward in this crisis amidst the US no-show, and they are a roadmap for a possible future scenario of permanent absence of leadership. Not only has the US been almost entirely absent on the international stage at this time of immense crisis, but because of Donald Trump, no other country is seeking US leadership. If regional organisations can step-up, US leadership is not only absent, it is also unnecessary."

    "content": "SMALL AND medium enterprises (SMEs) \u2500 backbone of Thailand\u2019s economy, with some three million of them accounting for 70 per cent of the total employment and 40 per cent of GDP \u2500 has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, about 75 per cent of tourism-related small businesses saw up to 75 per cent drop in their revenues due to overseas travel bans and restrictions. Also, the Asian Foundation report released last month found that the impact went beyond the tourism sector. Small producers of non-essential goods (e.g., apparels) were unable to reach their pre-COVID-19 sales even after the lockdown was lifted. As a result, 70 per cent of SMEs suffer from earning losses and 11 per cent of them risk permanent closure. Thus, it is necessary to finance these businesses and help them stay afloat. Financing SMEs: Limitations of Current Policies The Thai authorities were quick to respond. In April, schemes were launched to boost these firms\u2019 access to finance. First, the government approved a loan payment holiday for six months for loans less than 100 million baht (US$3.2 mil). This is laudable as 15 per cent of these enterprises have problems servicing their debts and the rising number of their non-performing loans (NPLs) will hurt the sovereign credit rating. This initiative was originally set to lapse on 22 October 2020 but will now end on 30 June 2021. Despite the extension, it is still too short. SMEs witnessed a revenue decline and have not seen their sales recover to the pre-pandemic level. Even if Thailand is to open up, it will take quite some time for foreign demands to pick up as some travel restrictions and regulations will still be intact. One might argue that despite foreign demand reductions, these enterprises can increasingly rely on domestic consumption. However, this scenario will less likely happen due to the rising household debts. For instance, the household debt-to-GDP ratio in the second quarter stood around 84 per cent, a huge surge from 50 per cent in 2009. Therefore, many small companies will encounter cashflow problems and will likely close shop when this scheme discontinues. Prohibitive Criteria The second programme involves the 400-billion-baht Corporate Bond Stabilisation Fund. Bank of Thailand directly purchases SMEs\u2019 bonds to increase liquidity and lessen default risks. This is a step in the right direction because the Thai corporate bond market is worth 3.6 trillion baht, representing about 20 per cent of GDP. Nevertheless, the Fund has never been used by SMEs due to its prohibitive criteria. The eligible companies must, among other things, possess investment grade bonds (i.e. BBB- and above), and have raised more than 50 per cent of their capital via bank loans. As Thai SMEs do not possess investment grade bonds, they are unable to benefit from this framework. In addition, Bank of Thailand offers 500-billion-baht worth of low interest rate loans to SMEs via commercial banks. It also bears the interest payments for the firms under the programme for the first six months. In short, SMEs can take interest-free loans (no more than 500 million baht per loan) for the first six months, and then pay the interest rate of two per cent per annum for two years. Despite the initiative\u2019s massive scale, only about 100 billion baht has been disbursed. This is because of two reasons: First, the uncertainties about the global economy and new waves of the virus make financial institutions reluctant to lend and absorb NPLs. Second, the qualifying criteria was set very high, enabling only a handful of SMEs to tap on it. For example, to be eligible, these enterprises must operate within Thailand, are not listed on the stock market, and serviced their debts no less than 90 days as of the end of last year. How to Better Finance SMEs The Thai government should adjust these policies to better address SMEs\u2019 cashflow needs and lessen the probability of defaults. For instance, the loan payment holiday must be extended to avoid defaults which could exacerbate unemployment and other problems in the economy. Also, the qualifying criteria of the Corporate Bond Stabilisation Fund should be relaxed to allow SMEs to participate. Moreover, to increase the usage of the low interest rate loan, the government should expand its credit guarantee schemes. At the time of writing, Thai Credit Guarantee Corporation \u2013 a state-owned entity established to provide guarantee services for SMEs \u2013 is being asked by the Thai business community to raise its maximum loan guarantee from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. The government should fulfill this request. Commercial banks avoid lending to SMEs as they fear NPLs. Therefore, the 50 per cent ceiling would entail that the government help these financial institutions bear more risks, making the latter more willing to lend. The Big Picture Beyond financing SMEs, the government should examine how other states\u2019 macroeconomic policies would likely affect the Thai economy and craft policies to create a viable business environment. The US Federal Reserve last week reaffirmed its commitment to maintain the near-zero interest rate for at least a few years to stimulate the US economy. The European Central Bank (ECB) chief said that ECB would be as aggressive as the Fed to galvanise the eurozone, revealing its desire to maintain a very low interest rate. These policies would eventually weaken the US dollar and euro, increasing the likelihood of baht appreciation against these currencies. Such scenario would not bode well for Thailand\u2019s economy which exports account for about 67 per cent of GDP. Stronger baht would sap the country\u2019s export competitiveness and reduce future export revenues. Therefore, Bank of Thailand should further loosen monetary policy, preventing the baht from being too strong. This will ultimately boost exports and help SMEs in this sector. To sum up, while the current SMEs schemes contain some merits, and there is room to improve them, the government must act fast as time is running out."

    "author(s)": "By Rajesh Basrur",
    "date": "No. 128 \u2013 23 June 2020",
    "content": "THE VIOLENT border confrontation between Chinese and Indian troops should not entirely come as a surprise. Though much time has elapsed since their 1962 war and lethal clashes between them in 1967 and 1975, frictions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) dividing the two forces have increased in frequency and intensity over the past two decades. According to one study, as many as 30 \u201cincidents\u201d occurred between 2003 and 2014, growing from two in 2003-05 to 16 in 2012-2014. A major run-in took place at Doklam at the tri-junction of Bhutan, China and India between June and August 2017. Hand- to-hand engagement has occurred regularly. More serious fighting is but a step away. What are the risks and what needs to be done? The Paradox: Stability & Instability While few analysts have observed the nuclear dimension of the China-India dyad, the tension between the two displays characteristics typical of a \u201ccold war\u201d-type rivalry between nuclear-armed states: rising tensions, brinkmanship, and crisis proneness. A central feature of such conflicts is the \u201cstability-instability paradox\u201d. As enunciated in the heyday of the Cold War, the concept held that, because nuclear adversaries cannot afford to fight for fear of mutual destruction, neither will initiate nuclear war (hence, stability); but that, precisely because of this, conventional war remains a viable option (instability). However, the history of nuclear dyads tells us something else: hostile nuclear powers invariably avoid major conventional war as well. As a matter of abundant caution, they try to stay on the \u201csafe\u201d side of two thresholds \u2013 those of nuclear and full-scale conventional war. In the modified paradox, varying forms of armed conflict short of major war occur periodically. One well-known phenomenon is proxy war (using the services of third parties, including non-state actors), which has been a feature of the Cold War (in the Afghanistan theatre) and India-Pakistan rivalry (in Kashmir). Others involve direct military action: one-off confrontations with limited violence (e.g. the shooting down of US reconnaissance planes over Soviet territory in 1960 and Cuba in 1962); occasional combat (US and Chinese aerial dogfights during the Vietnam War; sporadic military raids between India and Pakistan); frequent relatively low-level fighting (Chinese anti-aircraft batteries targeting US warplanes in Vietnam; India-Pakistan small arms firing); and more serious and sustained \u2013 but limited in scale and intensity \u2013 fighting (the Sino-Soviet border conflict of 1969; the India-Pakistan Kargil conflict in 1999). Fallout of the Stability-Instability Paradox Sino-Indian military engagement has hitherto been confined to scuffles, stone throwing and the like, but the trend is worrisome, especially now that there have been fatalities, with India admitting to 20 deaths and claiming an unspecified number on the Chinese side. Which way(s) will the Sino-Indian conflict go? At this point, there is no knowing what each side\u2019s calculus is and any analysis that claims knowledge of leaders\u2019 motives and strategies is speculative at best. But some reasonable inferences can be made from nuclear-strategic history. On the negative side, leaders under pressure are prone to demonstrate toughness and resolve in addressing adversaries as well as their own domestic audiences. President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are populist strongmen under domestic pressure arising from the twin crises of COVID-19 and economic turbulence and are involved in a game of \u201cchicken\u201d that neither would want to \u201close\u201d by swerving away from a major clash. Accordingly, both will be sensitive to the political cost of accommodation. And both will be tempted to push the envelope of psychological coercion to demonstrate an advantage. In addition, local military confrontations can easily go down a slippery slope of escalating tit-for-tat actions in the fog of crisis. Drivers for Restraint But there are strong incentives for both sides to exercise restraint. Unlike the other hostile nuclear dyads mentioned above, the China-India relationship carries a significant element of economic interdependence. Bilateral trade has grown enormously from US$ 2.2 billion in 2000 to US$ 90 billion in 2018. Though the balance of trade is tilted heavily in favour of China, and China depends less on India than vice versa, Beijing\u2019s interest in sustaining India as a strong trade partner is heightened by its on-going trade conflict with the United States. Additionally, Chinese FDI in India is estimated to be anywhere between $2 billion and $10 billion, with China expected to account for the largest share of India\u2019s FDI receipts, though the pandemic may modify calculations. But the strongest incentive to negotiate a compromise is still the presence of nuclear weapons. A pattern of cautious strategic behaviour is typical of nuclear belligerents. First, they tend to exercise unilateral caution and avoid major escalatory actions such as intensifying the use of military instruments or expanding the theatre of operations. China and India have exhibited such prudence thus far: no shots have been fired. Even if they are, major military clashes along the 4,000-km border are unlikely. the military A second aspect of cooperation is strategic engagement. This may occur in three ways: at informally between bureaucratic/political envoys in backchannel talks; and formally between political leaderships. The immediate utilisation of the first option by talks between regional military commanders has been an encouraging sign. local commanders; level between Ultimate Factor: Political Solution But any meaningful resolution of current tensions has ultimately to be political since it has to involve forward movement toward stabilising a long-disputed border. A Working Mechanism on Consultation and Coordination for India-China Border Affairs, created in 2012, has recorded no significant progress. Political leaders have met periodically, often at the summit level, but this has not prevented the current crisis because they have not tackled the central problem. The key source of military risk that needs to be addressed is the LAC. Disagreements over its precise delineation have produced local frictions over the years, with both armies jockeying for position on the ground. Military restraint is not a sufficient prerequisite for mitigating the nuclear risk associated with the stability-instability paradox. India has pressed for a formal demarcation, but China has been reluctant, apparently anticipating that an agreement might prejudice its case on the border dispute. Prime Minister Modi\u2019s public assurance in 2017 to the contrary has not yet persuaded Beijing. With the precise coordinates of the LAC being the source of military tensions, an agreement on it is essential for enhancing stability. Whether Beijing will be agreeable is the critical question."

    "title": "Russia and Myanmar: Moscow\u2019s Expanding Influence?",
    "author(s)": "By Christopher Cheang",
    "date": "No. 069 \u2013 26 April 2021",
    "content": "IN RECENT years, Russia\u2019s relations with Myanmar have strengthened, particularly in the defence sector. Russia is the second largest source of weapons for Myanmar, slightly ahead of China, according to an 18 March 2021 analysis by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute; between 2000 and 2019, Myanmar purchased US$1.7 billion worth of arms from China and US$1.44 billion from Russia. Not surprisingly, links between both countries\u2019 military establishments are openly warm. In November 2020, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu held talks via video link with the Myanmar military chief, General Min Aung Hlaing. It was stated that Russia was ready to expand cooperation with Myanmar, including joint work in the framework of the \"ADMM-Plus\" expert working group on countering terrorism. Supplying Myanmar with Missiles Shoigu was quoted as saying that despite the pandemic, \u201cwe continue to implement military delegation exchange events, including with your personal participation\". Shoigu also congratulated General Min on being awarded an honorary doctorate from the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences. He was given the title of \"Honorary Professor of the Military University\" of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation, as well as the medal \"For distinction\u201d In turn, General Min noted that despite the geographical distance, \u201cwe keep in touch, and you support us in difficult moments\". Regular visits by high-level Russian defence officials as well as Myanmar military officers to each other\u2019s countries have unsurprisingly taken place. The Irrawaddy, a Myanmar publication reported on 25 January 2021 that Shoigu\u2019s January visit to Myanmar illustrated that both sides planned to expand military cooperation. Russia agreed to supply Myanmar with Pantsir-S1 surface-to-air missile systems, Orlan-10E surveillance drones, and radar equipment, the publication added. Noteworthy is the publication\u2019s quoting General Min as saying that \u201cjust like a loyal friend, Russia has always supported Myanmar in difficult moments, especially in the last 4 years\u201d. Mutual Political Support? General Min reportedly has visited Russia six times, the last having taken place in May 2020, the 75th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany \u2014 a very important and symbolic holiday in Russia. Myanmar sends its officers to Russian military academies for training, as well as to China, India and Japan, and Israel. Its military also participated in some Russian military exercises. Political support from Russia has not been found wanting. Russia, with China, ensured that the UN Security Council could not issue a statement condemning the military\u2019s assumption of power in Myanmar in February. However, as the situation deteriorated, both countries supported a UNSC resolution in March which condemned the use of force, inter alia. Nevertheless, the presence of Russia\u2019s Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin at the 27 March Army Day in Naypyidaw was a clear signal of Moscow\u2019s determination to pursue its interests there. Fomin was quoted as saying that Russia \u201cadheres to a strategic line to intensify relations between the two countries\". He added that Myanmar was considered a reliable ally and strategic partner in Southeast Asia and the larger Asia-Pacific region. Fomin received a medal from General Min during his visit which he stressed was to reciprocate the Myanmar general\u2019s visit to Moscow in May 2020. Myanmar also coincidentally approved Russia\u2019s Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine in early February. Russian Motivations Russia\u2019s most immediate consideration is obviously commercial. Myanmar is a good and welcome customer of Russian weapons. At this point in time, Russian weapons sales constitute the bulk of its economic interaction with Myanmar. Second, Russia also seeks to raise its geopolitical profile in the region, and to signal to Myanmar (and its ASEAN neighbours) and the world at large, that Russia would not allow Western pressure on Myanmar to guide, let alone dictate its policy on the country. In doing so, Russia is fully aware that in the face of Western sanctions and severe criticism of Myanmar\u2019s military leadership, its support for Myanmar could become an additional apple of discord between Russia and the West. Third, Russia wants to add weight to its long-stated stance that there should be no interference into the internal affairs of a sovereign state and in the process, indirectly cock another snook at the West. Syria was the first case in which Russia challenged Western attempts to change the status quo. Fourth, its strong support for Myanmar also indirectly complements China\u2019s backing of that country while ensuring that should Chinese influence wane, Russia\u2019s might increase. Having the overall support of at least one of two UN Security Council Permanent Members is important to Myanmar. Of late, China has become a target of Myanmar\u2019s opposition forces. Some of its businesses were subjected to physical attacks in March. Moreover, Myanmar\u2019s military itself is reportedly ambivalent about China\u2019s growing influence in the country. China is a major investor and trade partner of Myanmar, unlike Russia. Russia's Southeast Asia Foothold Through Myanmar? Russia\u2019s actions have naturally been welcomed by Myanmar. There must be no doubt that it will remain a leading supplier of weapons as well as a reliable political supporter. Overall, however, having a foothold in Myanmar does not automatically lead to Russia becoming a major player in the region, until and unless its economic interactions with the rest of ASEAN, including Myanmar itself, rises considerably and outside the military/defence sector. At the same time, Russia must tread carefully in Myanmar, lest China becomes alarmed at any rapid and considerable increase in its influence, while China\u2019s is lessened, for one reason or another. Moreover, unlike China, Russia\u2019s relatively exiguous resources are concentrated in its relations with the former Soviet republics and the West. Ultimately, whether Russia becomes a major player in Myanmar and Southeast Asia is also dependent on whether it has the will and inclination to move away from its current and entrenched China-centric policy (towards the East) and devotes the necessary resources and energy to that end. As of now, that remains much in doubt."

    "title": "The Growing Challenge of the Extreme Right",
    "author(s)": "By Kumar Ramakrishna",
    "date": "No. 011 \u2013 20 January 2021",
    "content": "THE MOB that stormed the Capitol building in Washington DC on 6 January 2021, in a futile effort to prevent Congress from certifying the November 2020 election victory of Joe Biden over incumbent president Donald Trump, displayed a bewildering range of symbols representing the diverse populist and extremist forces supporting Trump. Intriguingly, The New York Times described the storming of the Capitol as \u201ca holy war\u201d in which \u201cwhite evangelical Christians fused with Trump extremism\u201d to provide the \u201cpolitical and theological underpinnings\u201d of the rampage. New Trends in Right Wing Extremism While the threat of violent Islamist extremism has occupied policy attention in the nearly two decades since the September 11 2001 attacks in the United States, the 6 January assault on the US Congress by the pro-Trump mob was symbolic of a wider, emergent trend in political and religiously-inspired violence across the world: Extreme Right Movements, at times fomenting hate crimes, violence and terrorism. Three types of Extreme Right movements appear of particular interest: White Supremacist, Buddhist and Hindu extremists. According to Julia Ebner, the Extreme Right comprises groups and individuals that espouse \u201cat least three of the following five features: nationalism, racism, xenophobia, anti-democracy and strong state advocacy\u201d; the Far Right represents the \u201cpolitical manifestation of the extreme right\u201d. Ebner\u2019s point that non-violent Far Right political figures and parties are ideologically related, albeit distantly, to the relatively more violence-prone Extreme Right, were a distinct feature of White Supremacist, Buddhist and Hindu extremist movements in 2020. The White Supremacist Extreme Right Extreme Right White Supremacist movements remain a complex, continually evolving, if fragmented, phenomenon. The movement is a bewildering amalgam of White nationalists, some White Christian evangelicals, racists, anti-government militias, misogynists, anti-globalisers, and anti-vaxxers, amongst others, seeking \u201cto capitalise on the global social and political upheaval\u201d \u2013 including the current pandemic \u2013 to promote intolerant ideas and at times inflict violence\u201d. According to some estimates, 67 percent of all domestic terrorist attacks and plots in the US between 1 January and 31 August 2020 were carried out by right-wing extremists. Meanwhile in the United Kingdom, in 2020, \u201cof the 27 late-stage terrorist attack plots in Great Britain disrupted by MI5 and CT Policing since 2017, eight have been right wing extremist\u201d. One important ideological strand of the White Supremacist Extreme Right \u2500 that, as we shall see, is very much in common with its Buddhist and Hindu ideological counterparts \u2500 is the notion of an existential threat to core group identity, in this case, White European identity. According to this discourse, a \u201cWhite Genocide\u201d is underway, perpetrated by non-White European out-groups like Jews, Hispanics and Muslims. White Genocide is allegedly the result of the stronger, insular identities and greater relative fertility rates of such out-groups, coupled with lax national immigration policies. Hence the \u201cGreat Replacement\u201d of the White Christian European races needs thwarting urgently. While such notions have certainly fuelled violent Extreme Right attacks such as the New Zealand mosque shootings in 2019, they have been increasingly mainstreamed into Far Right political discourse as well. For example, European Far Right political parties portray themselves as the \u201cdefenders of European values, culture, and civilisation\u201d, while slogans such as \u201cEurope for Europeans\u201d have been increasingly prevalent. The Buddhist Extreme Right In Sri Lanka, in 2020 the leading Extreme Right Buddhist monk Galagodaatte Gnanasara, who has long been \u201caccused of instigating hate crimes against Muslims in the country\u201d secured a seat in the parliament, on behalf of his Far Right-oriented Our Power of People party. Gnanasara, leader of the Extreme Right Buddhist movement Bodu Bala Sena (BBS), or Buddhist Power Force, has long urged the Sinhalese Buddhist majority to defend their identity and interests against Islamist extremism. Meanwhile in Myanmar, another Extreme Right Buddhist monk, Ashin Wirathu, days prior to Myanmar\u2019s November 2020 general election, voluntarily surrendered to the police in Yangon. Wirathu has long been an influential social media personality, following the country\u2019s transition from military rule in 2011. In several incendiary sermons over the years, he has targeted Myanmar\u2019s Rohingya Muslim minority, accusing it of posing an existential threat to Myanmar\u2019s Bamar Buddhist majority identity. Despite Wirathu\u2019s arrest, Myanmar\u2019s 2020 election saw the Rohingya almost completely excluded from participating. Meanwhile, members of the Extreme Right Buddhist movement Ma Ba Tha openly campaigned for the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP). The Far Right orientation of the USDP was somewhat reflected in its exploitation of the race and religion card during the campaigning, further suggesting that the politicisation of Buddhism in Myanmar will persist. The Hindu Extreme Right Meanwhile in India, the same close nexus between Extreme Right Social Movements and Far Right political parties is also evident. The Hindu Far Right Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government remained very much in sync with the broader Extreme Right Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) social movement \u2500 characterised as \u201cthe holding company of Hindu supremacism\u201d or \u201cHindutva\u201d ideology. The BJP is widely regarded as the \u201cpolitical wing\u201d of the RSS. The mainstreaming of the Hindutva worldview within India\u2019s national politics in 2020 contributed to several incidents that appeared to target the country\u2019s Muslim community. These included the Delhi riots in February 2020 against the backdrop of the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests. The CAA and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) were criticised as allegedly discriminatory against Muslims. Furthermore, the government\u2019s \u201cunilateral revocation of Kashmir\u2019s semi-autonomous status and the subsequent decision to allow non-residents to purchase properties in Kashmir\u201d, as well as the castigation of the Tablighi Jamaat missionary movement for allegedly ignoring safe distancing measures, thereby contributing to the spread of COVID-19, reinforced Hindutva accusations that Muslims were an existential threat. In sum, dealing with \u201cthe extreme right threat\u201d \u2013 across all three extremisms \u2500 has proven \u201cdeeply complicated for states\u201d, because the \u201cbleed into the political mainstream\u201d has rendered the problem \u201cvery difficult to isolate and eradicate\u201d surgically. Implications: Interlocking Extremist Movements? Going forward, greater research is needed to explore at least two issues. First, how do Extreme Right movements network with and influence one another? This can occur within and between such movements. For instance, it is known that Buddhist extremist figures like Sri Lanka\u2019s Gnanasara and Myanmar\u2019s Wirathu have institutionalised ties, while White Supremacist extremist groups have also established transnational links. Moreover, ideological cross-fertilisation across Extreme Right movements also occurs. Thus Gnanasara asserted in 2019 that his \u201cideology\u201d was influenced by \u201cHindu right-wing group Shiv Sena, the British National Party, and French far-right leader Marine Le Pen \u2500 all of whom have made incendiary remarks on Islam and Muslims\u201d. Second, it would be particularly important to better grasp what trigger factors could cause Extreme Right ideological ecosystems of interlocking social movements and various institutions, charismatic influencers, political parties and social media platforms, to generate violence \u2500 as we witnessed in Washington DC on 6 January."

    "title": "Global Health Security Temporary Closure of Mosques: Sharia Flexibility in Singapore",
    "author(s)": "By Mohamed Bin Ali and Ahmad Saiful Rijal",
    "date": "No. 069 \u2013 13 April 2020",
    "content": "AS COVID-19 began to spread within the community, the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) on 24 March 2020 took the unprecedented step to announce the temporary closure of all mosques in the country. Upon the advice of the Fatwa Committee, MUIS also directed the suspension of the obligatory Friday prayers pending recovery from the global pandemic. The objective was to break the cycle of local community transmission of COVID-19 through mosque clusters. Singapore is among the first few countries in the world to close their mosques amid the COVID-19 threat. As the move had never been done before, it required a certain boldness of resolve backed by independent reasoning to formulate the supporting fatwa. Thereafter, other countries whether with Muslim majorities or minorities took a similar stance. Singapore\u2019s fatwa has resonated globally as other Islamic authorities and scholars similarly called for the temporary closure of mosques and suspension of Friday prayers in the face of the pandemic. Progressive Muslim Community The fatwa or religious edict on mosque closure reflects the progressive spirit of a minority Muslim community. It also highlights the need for religious scholars to be proactive, courageous and be open to work hand-in-hand with authorities to make decisions that are timely and accurate, yet without compromising religious principles. In this regard, MUIS exhibited independent religious thinking by acting swiftly based on the situation report from the Ministry of Health about returnees from a Tabligh movement\u2019s mass gathering in Kuala Lumpur, two of whom tested positive for COVID- 19. Recognising the potential of large mosque clusters emerging within the community, the Fatwa Committee convened within days and issued its newly formulated fatwa authorising the mosque closures. This probably helped narrow the window for the virus to circulate among the mosque congregants, thus preventing large clusters from forming. Malaysia, which closed all its mosques about a week later on the18 March 2020 saw a large cluster formed from the same Tabligh event. This flexibility and independence of thought are also exhibited in other MUIS initiatives during this highly-challenging period, extending Muslim verbal greetings while refraining from the traditional handshakes. Extensive research has also been conducted by MUIS on how to incorporate national measures like social distancing into congregational prayers should conditions allow for mosques to be reopened. The Singapore Fatwa Twelve days before the blanket temporary closures of mosques, MUIS directed the disinfection of all mosques in Singapore. This followed confirmation by the authorities that at least 90 Singaporeans had attended the Tabligh gathering at Seri Petaling Mosque in Selangor. Two of them subsequently tested positive for COVID-19. It was the rising number of infections that led MUIS to close the mosques pending recovery from the pandemic. The Mufti of Singapore, Dr Nazirudin Mohd Nasir, emphasised the need for mosques to remain closed and for congregational prayers to remain suspended until there were significant improvements in the situation as advised by the Ministry of Health. To date, the Fatwa Committee maintains the view that the temporary closure of mosques or the suspension of congregational prayers during the pandemic is an emergency, which required exceptional religious rulings to save lives. Using the Islamic legal maxims of \u201cemergencies permit the unlawful\u201d and \u201charm must be eliminated\u201d, the Fatwa Committee ascertained that it was therefore permissible for Muslim men to forego the obligatory Friday prayers as such large gatherings would enhance the risk of community exposure to the virus threat. Mosques were also closed for other congregational prayers and religious activities. Subsequently, similar moves were taken up by Muslims in other countries to close mosques as the virus threat spread rapidly within communities across the globe. Flexibility of Sharia Law The point that is often missed is that Sharia is not a static set of rules devoid of flexibility. The nature of Sharia has been indiscriminately abused by conservative Islamist groups such that Sharia law is associated with rigidity and severity. In actual fact, flexibility is one of the defining characteristics of Sharia. Through the process of ijtihad (the exercise of reasoning to derive new rules from Islamic principles), Muslim jurists throughout Islamic history had codified legal theories and established a plethora of methodologies to suit the context and challenges of different times. These theories accumulated over time to form a treasure trove of guidelines for future jurists to rely on with room for flexibility and adaptability. This very feature has enabled Sharia rulings to remain applicable and adjustable according to context, dealing even with society\u2019s unprecedented situations. Islamic scholars are guided by Sharia law\u2019s principles, while providing Muslims with practical and appropriate guidance. There is no better example than the permitted lifting of restrictions to eat pork during life-threatening emergencies. Should a Muslim ever be in a position to choose between dying or eating pork, the guiding principle of life preservation takes precedence over the prohibition to consume the meat. The adaptability of Sharia is probably its greatest asset and manifestation of a living religion. The fatwa on mosque closure provides a model of how Sharia law is not cast in stone and can adapt to change in a timely, yet religiously-aligned manner. This requires wisdom, courage and flexible mindsets on the part of religious authorities. By adopting these values of the Sharia, an authentic yet progressive Islam can provide solutions to problems that Muslims face today."

    "content": "IN JANUARY 2021, the major tech companies (Twitter, Facebook and Alphabet) \u2018deplatformed\u2019 Donald Trump from their products, a decision supported by 89 per cent of the Democrats. In late March, Trump\u2019s senior adviser announced on Fox News that Trump should be returning to a social network of his own. Now that Trump is banned from the mainstream platforms, there is general scepticism about Trump\u2019s abilities to scale and maintain his social media presence. Still, can Trump\u2019s plan take off? In the current landscape, Trump is heavily dependent on the gatekeeping of Big Tech. Although his constituents might be looking forward to his next social media move, there are concerns that Trump\u2019s team can effectively develop an environment that can attract his followers. The Gatekeepers & the \u2018Alt-Tech\u2019 In an era of \u2018Trump-like\u2019 social media, Parler is the best example. Parler was considered a free-speech haven; millions migrated to the platform as Big Tech cracked down on misinformation. However, on 6 January 2021, Alphabet, Apple and Amazon blocked the Parler app from their operating systems on the grounds of incitement of violence. Parler is not the first \u2018Alt-Tech\u2019 ban. In 2017, Gab was removed from the Google Play Store on similar grounds, while the app has never been approved for placement on Apple\u2019s App Store. Additionally, the Google Play Store also removed Trump\u2019s 2020 Campaign app for non-functionality. Indeed, Trump\u2019s new platform would have to consider the best user experience for his constituents. Smartphones play a crucial role in social media\u2019s success by offering relevant user data and allowing users always to be connected. However, most smartphones are controlled by Big Tech, in particular Apple and Alphabet. These gatekeepers not only decide when and how to comply with their comprehensive policies, but they are also accountable for the content that might violate US laws. In the presence of any illicit material, these companies may be required to remove the app in question. Consequently, Trump\u2019s platform would have to focus on product and policy development and implement a robust content moderation system that complies with product policies and intermediary liability regulations. To circumvent this, Trump\u2019s team may launch an app outside the Apple App Store or Google Play, which would meet its challenges around distribution and user-friendliness. No matter the technological model or the users that make part of this social network, this new endeavour requires developing new policies that also keep the platform functioning at the minimum levels. The Constituents: Is User Migration Feasible? Jason Miller, Trump\u2019s senior advisor, noted that Trump\u2019s social media platform would draw tens of millions of people. He might be right. 85 per cent of Republicans believe social media intentionally censors political viewpoints they find objectionable. A survey from January 2021 identified that roughly eight-in-ten Republicans disagree with the deplatforming actions taken after the 6 January events. Conservatives believe they are under attack. Last year, Parler saw its user base grow from 1 million to 1.5 million users in a week with the \u2018Alt-Right\u2019 migration. With 88 million followers on Twitter, 35 million followers on Facebook, and 2.7 million subscribers on YouTube, the magnitude of Trump\u2019s supporters is evident. The outcomes of the 2020 US presidential election results can prove that. Indeed, Trump has a large fanbase; however, is a user migration feasible? As posed by Singh and Singh, \u2018network effects are like gravity. The greater the number of people on a network, the greater its \u201cmass\u201d\u2019. Creating a network is not simple. It takes time to build a new profile that will result in extended social connections. No matter the constituents, the success of a social network highly depends on a robust online community. Moreover, regardless of its constituents, any social media platform requires a strong product policy foundation that ensures the basic level of content quality and product functionality for its users. Without this basic formula, social media platforms might not take off. Ripple Effects: Maximised Polarisation and Censorship? In January, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) raised concerns about deplatforming. Deplatforming may have a ripple effect. It may create a precedent to be used to censor alternative voices in the future. While one may create its social media or go to Fox News to express their views, the risk lies in censorship of dissident voices around the globe that are solely dependent on the power of the US Big Tech for expression. Additionally, Trump\u2019s social media announcement the consequences of the ban. Furthermore, polarisation and homogeneity might result from a joint effect of confirmation bias and social influence. As new conservative platforms are developed, confirmation bias  and polarisation may become more prominent. is an early sign of The concept of conservative and \u2018Alt-Right\u2019 may become even more extreme. Users will no longer focus on supposedly diverse platforms; instead, they might be focusing solely on social media platforms that fully reinforce their views, increasing the formation of homogeneous clusters. This effect can create an unpredictable political environment of extremism. Political platforms with the single purpose of centralising conservative or \u2018Alt-Right\u2019 views looking for like-minded people may intensify polarisation even further in the real world. What\u2019s Next? Whether Trump succeeds in launching his own social media platform, he will undoubtedly face challenges in the current landscape. There is a strong pressure to crack down on extremist conservative views. However, Trump\u2019s power is his pool of fans waiting for his next move online and are ready to follow his lead. Experts have argued that \u2018Alt-Tech\u2019 platforms could serve as recruitment for the far right. Consequently, Trump\u2019s new social media plans might result in the \u2018Alt-Tech\u2019 amplification. Donald Trump\u2019s suspension from Facebook was reviewed by The Facebook Oversight Board in early May, and the board has upheld the suspension for now. However, Facebook has six months to consider replatforming Trump. In light of the latest developments, it would be wise for Facebook to assess the repercussions of their actions and the implications on dissident and civic speech in future cases. Instead of only acting reactively in response of a crisis, social media platforms and regulators should push for more regulatory changes. Additionally, companies like Facebook should reassess their policies by making them more transparent and consistent to avoid \u2018spirit of the policy\u2019 decisions that are useful only when it suits their own interests. Certainly, Donald Trump has criticised the suspension. Banning Trump from the mainstream platforms does not mean that his voice will not be heard by his supporters. Banning actions may instead boost the polarisation effects in the offline world and create a negative precedent for dissident voices. Deplatforming can be the beginning of a new and unpredictable polarised online world with real-life socio-political ramifications, and social media platforms should be accountable for the ripple effects caused by their actions."

    "title": "Decarbonisation on a Finite Planet",
    "author(s)": "By Margareth Sembiring",
    "date": "No. 202 \u2013 25 November 2020",
    "content": "DECARBONISATION THROUGH the deployment of low-carbon technologies such as electric vehicles, solar and wind power has become the most dominant strategy in combating climate change. It is a central component of reaching net-zero or carbon neutrality. While much focus is given on its potential role to reduce emissions and create jobs, the context within which decarbonisation is taking place receives much less attention. Recognising existing realities is important because high emissions are not the only environmental crisis confronting humanity. Rather, the Earth has long been suffering from resource over-extraction and biodiversity decline which, together with the use of fossil fuels, are deteriorating the planet\u2019s health even further. Thus, unless continuing expansion of low-carbon technologies takes into account existing environmental and social challenges carefully, decarbonisation may unintentionally run the risk of exacerbating problems instead of solving them meaningfully. The Context Drivers of environmental degradation abound, but consumption demand plays a key role. Consumption is responsible for emissions. Between 1990 and 2008, a group of developed countries listed in the Annex B of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol registered a three percent drop in territorial emissions. However, emissions embedded in imported goods from developing countries reversed the negative number and rendered the Annex B countries contributing to 11 percent of global emission growth instead. In fact, every year since the 1970s, the world\u2019s consumption has been exacting toll on Mother Earth\u2019s resources more than what it can regenerate, resulting in what is referred to as \u2018overshoot\u2019. It practically means resource depletion and carbon accumulation in the atmosphere. Our consumption today sees an overshoot equivalent of 1.6 Earths, with advanced economies, and by extension the richer segments of society, disproportionately consuming more. The state of resource over-extraction due to high consumption is consistent with 2.3 million km2 of forest being deforested globally between 2000 and 2012 with only about 35 percent being reforested. It is also reflected in global material footprint that continued to increase from 73.2 billion metric tonnes to 85.9 billion metric tonnes between 2010 and 2017 despite efforts to increase resource efficiency and reduce material use through, for example, circular economy in some societies. Various sustainability certification mechanisms are in place. Net forest loss rate has slowed down in the last decade. Conservation and management initiatives are showing progress. Although these are positive developments, the overall impact remains limited as nature continues to spiral into a dangerous decline. Worsening land degradation has reached critical levels in many parts of the world affecting at least 3.2 billion people. Similarly, current extinction rates are unprecedented and accelerating, with about 1,000,000 animal and plant species now being threatened. Indeed, the fact that none of the 2020 Aichi Biodiversity Targets, which were adopted during the 10th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in Nagoya, Japan, in 2010, will be fully met this year strongly indicates that humanity is failing Mother Earth. Low-Carbon Energy Transition Low-carbon technologies require many more critical minerals compared to their fossil fuel-based counterparts. An electric car requires five times more minerals compared to a conventional car, and an onshore wind plant needs eight times as much compared to a gas-fired plant of the same capacity. The development of electric storage batteries may even result in a 1,000 per cent increase in demands for aluminium, cobalt, iron, lead, lithium, manganese and nickel. Such material-intensive requirement means intensifying mining activities, which are known to be environmentally destructive and socially problematic. Nickel mining has turned parts of Indonesia\u2019s Sulawesi sea red with nearby fishing community being affected. Lithium extraction has caused environmental degradation and affected drinking water supplies for local communities in Chile\u2019s Andes Mountain region. Cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the single largest cobalt producer in the world, has seen alleged cases of environmental destruction and human rights abuse. A parallel issue is waste generation. The manufacturing and deployment rates of low- carbon products are currently outpacing recycling capacity. Not only recycling technologies for lithium-ion batteries are still being figured out, solar panel and wind blade wastes are projected to amount to respectively 78 million tonnes and 43 million tonnes by 2050. In a world that is still grappling with plastic waste conundrum, which is now increasingly witnessing mounting electronic waste, these additional millions of tonnes of waste from low-carbon products will certainly add extra pressures on the natural environment. The revival of once controversial carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology also presents another uneasy scenario. In view of the likelihood of tropical forest soils and permafrost discharging enormous amount of trapped carbon into the atmosphere should the world\u2019s temperature increase further, the prospect of disturbing the land ecosystems by digging deep into the Earth in a bid to find a permanent storage for CCS\u2019 sequestered carbon is unsettling despite technical claim of its safety. Holistic Approach Needed: Renewable Energy Not Enough Reducing fossil fuel use is important, but simply replacing it with renewable energy sources may not necessarily save the planet. A more holistic approach may point to the need to reduce consumption in absolute terms towards restoring a balance with nature while reducing emissions at the same time. A transformation of the current global economic system to a steady-state economy may be a way to achieve such a vision. A steady-state economy is defined as \u201can economy with constant population and constant stock of capital, maintained by a low rate of throughput that is within the regenerative and assimilative capacities of the ecosystem\u201d. In practice, the steady-state economy concept proposes wealthy countries to reduce consumption absolutely by slowing down economic growth and focusing instead on improving population\u2019s well-being through less material use, so that poorer countries can have the resources and ecological space they need to grow; all towards functioning within environmental limits. This transformation will certainly require a rethinking of how the measurement of societal progress and the different aspects of human security such as food, economic, and health, are to be reconfigured to remain compatible within the Earth\u2019s limits. Strong cooperation from members of the public and the business sector is key. Effective multilateral cooperation is essential but the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic clearly demonstrates that it is not within easy reach. Standing somewhat less prominently in the 2018 IPCC report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C is the following observation: \u201c1.5\u00b0C pathways that include low energy demand, low material consumption, and low GHG-intensive food consumption have the most pronounced synergies and the lowest number of trade-offs with respect to sustainable development and the SDGs.\u201d For the sake of the future of the planet and humanity, giving consumption reduction a stronger emphasis and a systemic treatment probably cannot wait any longer."

    "author(s)": "By Mely Caballero-Anthony",
    "date": "No. 162 \u2013 26 August 2020",
    "content": "THE OUTBREAK of the COVID-19 pandemic has brought home the fact that advancing regional cooperation has become even more critical for ASEAN and its multilateral agenda. ASEAN remains an important platform to deepen cooperation among the member states. In the wider East Asian region, ASEAN also works with countries like China, Japan and South Korea through the ASEAN Plus Three (APT) framework; and with Australia, India, New Zealand, Russia and the United States joining the ASEAN Plus Three countries through the East Asia Summit (EAS). Since the outbreak of COVID-19, ASEAN\u2019s shared existential threat has never been felt stronger. The impact of the long-drawn health crisis has already exacted a huge toll on the region\u2019s economy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has projected that the global economy will contract by 4.9 percent this year. A global economic recovery is contingent on the discovery of a vaccine. Global Race for a Vaccine The race to find a vaccine has already seen countries making exclusive purchasing agreements with big pharmaceutical companies to lock in access before these vaccines are safely rolled out for mass production. This \u2018my country first\u2019 approach hugely disadvantages countries that do not have the resources nor capacity to join the bandwagon of vaccine nationalism. It will seriously undermine the global fight against COVID-19. Can ASEAN centrality and its brand of inclusive multilateralism push back this alarming trend of vaccine nationalism? ASEAN has played a significant role in the region\u2019s fight against COVID-19. In the early phase of the outbreak, ASEAN activated its regional mechanisms on pandemic preparedness and response to support national measures in fighting the spread of the pandemic."

    "author(s)": "By Alan Chong",
    "date": "No. 112 \u2013 22 July 2021",
    "content": "IN RECENT weeks, seasonal summer rains wrought unprecedented havoc in Germany, Belgium, Austria and many places nearby. Scenes televised and shared around the world showed quaint once-picturesque towns upended by massive currents of mud and burst riverbanks. Whole houses, shops, main streets, community facilities and cars were swept away as if they were flimsy toys in the face of nature\u2019s fierce tempest. News editorials and reporters on the ground spontaneously chorused a universal question: why were their governments neglectful of preparing for this tragedy? Worse, both pictures and utterances of disbelief at the sheer damage wrought by nature implied that sovereign power was helpless against the wrath of wind, rain and flood. In the pan-Asian region stretching from Pakistan in the west, threading through Indonesia and northwards towards Indochina, China, the Korean Peninsula and Japan, Europe\u2019s recent devastation is like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Throughout Asia, natural disasters have been annual contenders for the position of biggest national security threat. But how should the policy and scholarly communities rethink the \u2018international relations\u2019 of sovereign states? Refocus on the Social Contract States have long been assumed to operate according to the ideal of possessing a clearly demarcated political border, containing an identifiable population, both border in turn ruled by a government. A government in control of border and population is described as possessing sovereignty \u2013 a legal condition that implies there are no serious and material challenges to that government\u2019s monopoly of power and legitimate authority. Under both constitutional and political definitions, sovereignty is supposed to be employed by rulers to protect the population by defending the border. This clearly did not apply when the rains and floods came for the German towns last week, and perennially for most of monsoon-vulnerable Asia. What sovereignty must address going forward is the re-evaluation of the social contract that undergirds sovereignty. The population \u2013 or preferably \u2018We the People\u2019 \u2013 consent to that very sovereignty in an exchange relationship. The government is elected, or assigned authority and power by alternative means as it may be the case in some authoritarian states, on the basis that the people obtain protection within the sovereign state from all threats to life, liberty and prosperity to the fullest extent possible. When the foundations of the present Westphalian-based world order were derived in the 1600s, the European political powers of the day were concerned with thwarting religious zealotry and imposition, as well as territorial grabs by neighbours. Commerce quickly emerged soon after as another reason for sovereignty: government needed to order the markets through laws of equity, transparency and assurance. Now one\u2019s life, liberty, property and economic livelihoods are being rendered equally risky by the forces of nature. In short, the sovereign state needs to expand the moral and legal foundations of its social contract by admitting to the insecurities of the human person arising from nature\u2019s caprice. The latter can be named as the usual ecological suspects: global warming, overconsumption of biodiversity and natural resources, and the release of industrially produced gases that upset the chemical equilibrium of Planet Earth\u2019s air. Interdependent Consequences Take global warming for instance. This is an international relations issue because it is possible today to measure nationally emitted industrial pollution in terms of volumes of specific oxide gases and the well-known carbon emissions. States can therefore be ranked in terms of pollution severity. The cumulative trajectories arising from the UN Conference on Environment and Development\u2019s (UNCED) \u2018Earth Summit\u2019 in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, produced the equivalent of an acknowledgement by virtually every sovereign state that the warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere was a collective responsibility of all governments. This was also symptomatic of what political scientists have termed the tragedy of the commons. If no state owned up to being a contributor to a planetary problem, global warming will only be compounded by every sovereign state\u2019s insistence on unilateral interpretations, or worse, neglect of a common malaise. But global warming has border crossing consequences. Every sovereign state will be affected by every other sovereign state\u2019s policies governing their national pollution. The unevenness of each set of national policies cannot but compound the problem of an excess in discharge of toxic gases that erode the natural composition of breathable air through the disruption of the various atmospheric layers enclosing the Earth. The build-up of toxic gasses traps heat within the Earth and in turn disturbs the natural movement of air masses. This in turn triggers extreme weather events like the exceptionally heavy thunderstorms in Europe, and the increasing frequency of tropical cyclones in Asia. It goes without saying that no single sovereign authority can eliminate extreme weather threats to each and every member of their socially contracted citizenry. There is sufficient moral and rational reasoning to embrace the idea that human security is an idea whose time has come. And it is urgent because global warming has produced a situation of interdependent consequences for every human being because of industrial activities occurring in every sovereign territory. Human Security: Security Policy for Climate Change Sovereign states must confront extreme weather events by rethinking the moral and pragmatic purposes of international relations. Unfortunately, the time honoured saying that something is as unpredictable as the weather has still stuck in the minds of old- fashioned sovereignty-bound politicians. Enlightened leadership of today\u2019s complex industrialised nation-states needs to appreciate that human security is upon us. The ability to rehabilitate the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, for instance, must mean that every human being regardless of whichever region they are located in, is synonymous with the security of every citizen. The social contract that enables sovereignty to stand must include humanity\u2019s self- preservation in its ultimate sense of becoming security policy. Europe\u2019s latest thunderstorm \u2013 inflicted human miseries have joined Asia\u2019s climate-induced population displacements in a global community of fate."

    "title": "Global Health Security COVID-19 and School Closures: Why Education Sector Needs Protecting",
    "author(s)": "By Tamara Nair",
    "date": "No. 067 \u2013 9 April 2020",
    "content": "SCHOOLS ARE where socialisation is encouraged and rightfully so. They are microcosms of the societies within which students will ultimately be embedded to live their lives. But schools are also more than that. They are places, for many students in this world, where access to food, water, safety and well-being is guaranteed for at least as long as the school day. Understandably, schools can also be hotbeds of infection given the close proximity of so many over a number of hours each day. And the young and very young are hard to convince when one speaks of social distancing. As of the end of March this year, 185 nations have country-wide school closures and that accounts for 89.4 percent of enrolled students globally, from pre-primary, primary, lower and upper secondary as well as tertiary levels of education. This situation cannot be without repercussions and will not be an easy scenario to walk back from. Schools: Provide and Protect The speed and scale of the current disruption is unparalleled in modern history. There are compelling reasons why keeping students away from schools, at least for this long, may not be ideal and in fact can be detrimental not only to the students of today but also the security of nations in the future. This points to the importance of preparing educational institutions for large-scale disruptions by strategic planning and dedication of resources to keeping them open for as long as possible. Schools are not only educational institutions, in many parts of the world, they are also kitchens that provide the only form of nutrition to many school-going children. Schools\u2019 feeding programmes are sometimes the only meal of the day that many children in the world have access to. At the moment, 300 million children are missing school meals as a result of the virus. The realisation of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger is often through schools as well. School feeding programmes in countries like Timor Leste help with food and nutritional insecurities faced by children. Similar to Timor Leste, the World Food Programme has feeding programmes in the Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar and Laos \u2013 all countries with serious rates of child malnourishment. Children could lose access to a daily nutritious meal if schools were to remain closed for long periods of time. For many children, schools also equate to safety from physical harm and exploitation. When children are not in schools they become easy targets. They can be abused, set to work, exploited in other ways and even recruited into unsavoury groups or organisations. In fact, schools are also places where abused and exploited children are often identified. This is not to say that nothing bad ever happens to students in schools. But for many students around the world, schools and the social networks and support they provide often create a sanctuary away from whatever trauma or terror they might be exposed to at home or in the streets, every day. Schools as Support Structures Schools are support structures for nations. Not only do they educate, they are a micro- economy unto themselves \u2013 from transport services to bookshops, to printers and publishers, to laboratory and media equipment, to coffeehouses and canteens and restaurants and fast-food chains; school closures affect all of these. Schools also allow a fighting chance for all to have equal economic opportunities in the future. They can also be spaces where gender discrimination can be reduced, especially with programmes that encourage the enrolment of girls since female students are the ones that often stop or postpone their education to go out to work to support families. This will happen if the economic situation worsens and we see years of work in reducing the gender gap in education being slowly dismantled. Ultimately, educational institutions get the next generation of labour ready. A trained labour force powers economies; accelerates their growth and development. Even a short period of closure can have implications on the economic security of nations. Preparing Educational Institutions The experience of countries that have had to shut down schools should bring to our attention the need to include them in pandemic preparedness. Countries like Sweden and Australia have kept their schools open. Increased precautionary measures, and here Singapore schools stand out as an excellent example: staggering breaks, temperature monitoring, reminders to wash their hands, cancelling mass assemblies, after-school activities and inter school competitions, have all made schools one of the safer places to be in. But Singapore too has recently had to shut schools for a month. A global health crisis like COVID-19 is a classic non-traditional security challenge. True to the latter\u2019s definition, it has involved large populations and has traversed across state boundaries requiring an \u2018all-of-society\u2019 approach to overcome. That translates into many actors at many levels of governance stepping up coordination and cooperation. But if we are to learn anything from this pandemic it is that the lines of communication between those that need and those that give should be open and clear. Learning in Uncharted Times Investments in education in the Global South henceforth may have to take a different form from just building infrastructure and feeding programmes. If anything, this pandemic has taught us the importance of bridging digital divides and increasing connectivity in countries that lag behind now. Such infrastructure can help students to continue to learn even in the event of serious disruptions. Humanitarian assistance may also include educational technology or infrastructure that can be brought in. This together with other strategies must help delay school closures for as long as possible in crises situations. Prolonged forced absence from educational institutions is a dangerous path to be on for any country. Schools serve social and economic functions. As the global economy tries to fix itself in the aftermath of this pandemic, it will need the skills and training of a prepared workforce ready to move in. Will we see this happen? The answer lies in what we do today to try and keep our students learning in unchartered times."

    "title": "Personal Data: Its Value, Risks & Potential",
    "author(s)": "By Teo Yi-Ling",
    "date": "No. 040 \u2013 17 March 2020",
    "content": "ON 28 FEBRUARY 2020, the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the regulatory agency overseeing communications by television, satellite, radio, wire, and cable across the US, announced that it was going to propose some of its most substantial financial penalties against four of the largest US mobile networks carriers. These proposed penalties, in excess of US$200 million, would be in respect of these carriers \u2013 Sprint, T-Mobile, AT & T, and Verizon \u0336 selling customers\u2019 real-time location data. This would be the first instance of the FCC addressing this issue of location data transactions in terms of privacy invasion. Free Market Failures For some time now, there has been a thriving market in location data and the lack of regulation around it, as highlighted in an earlier addressing the issue of data privacy erosion and security. Countries that have the business presence of some of these carriers, as well as countries that have data hub ambitions \u2013 like Singapore \u2013 will be watching this move by the FCC very carefully, as the outcomes of this will have accompanying ramifications for compliance and governance. While carriers have been allowed under US federal law to use location data for providing services like medical emergency alerts, fraud prevention, roadside assistance, and monitoring human trafficking, a report last year disclosed that some carriers were selling data to private individuals like car salesmen, property managers, bail bondsmen and bounty hunters, even after undertaking publicly to curtail this activity. The contracts that the carriers had entered into with their customers (who commonly \u2018consent\u2019 to the wide \u2018standard terms\u2019 of the contracts because they have no choice) had not been effective at preventing such unauthorised behaviour, as the carriers had reneged on their own contractual obligations. This essentially meant that millions of smartphones were being tracked for apparently illegal purposes. The scale of the issue is considerable \u2013 data of hundreds of millions of individuals owning smartphones were being continuously aggregated and traded. If triangulated correctly (for example with purchasing data or locations visited), such data does reveal personal and intimate details. Further, it may be the case that such aggregated data is feeding the already-thriving black market for data operated by cyber criminals. Market Corrections Such data selling-on is widespread among app makers and other technology companies (e.g. Facebook, Google and Tik Tok), but the telecommunications sector is subject to more stringent laws concerning the protection of customers\u2019 privacy, given that carriers have more access to their customers\u2019 personal data. Given the existing regulatory framework, the fact that that a small group of the largest telecommunications players collectively failed in their legal obligations, makes the situation more egregious and concerning. Observers have noted that even if the fines are imposed, the quantum is manifestly inadequate, and would not meaningfully serve as a deterrent. Notwithstanding issues of quantum, addressing deficiencies on the part of the telecommunications players is the next logical step, following from regulatory tightening taking place further upstream on the supply chain, nearer the sources of data, in order to properly manage accountability. In the last 12 months, the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has taken action in this respect against putative data collectors.: the $5 billion fine imposed on Facebook over the Cambridge Analytical scandal, the fine of $17 million on Google for violating the privacy of children on YouTube, and the fine of $5.7 million on the social media app Tik Tok over collecting data on underage children. Data as a Regulated Resource Could such enforcement be the impetus of rationalising data as a scarce resource? As has always been the case, useful resources are eventually subjected to regulatory action to prevent monopolistic or dominant market power abuse, impose transparency, and provide protection for consumers. Could a push for more comprehensive regulation then have a knock-on effect of crystallising the notion of personal data as property, capable of being owned and controlled? Once given away, the value of data increases exponentially in the hands of those entities whose business models are predicated upon the collection and exploitation of data. To cast this situation in the cold light of day, this is an extremely one-sided and exploitative trade practice: large entities acquiring tangible value over the trade and monetising of volumes of data obtained all too easily. The original source of the data \u2013 the individual \u2013 is left standing in a position that is worse off, having little or no control of how the data is used against him or her. Leaving the issue to market mechanics has so far proved ineffective in terms of protecting the value of data. Policymakers need to consider whether real value must be given in return to the individuals, upon whose personal information and the transactions thereon, a gargantuan and insatiable demand for data has arisen. Looking Ahead, Staying Grounded The future posits shifting to more digital paradigms than less. Personal data utility will continue to be reshaped, redefined, and refocused, with the market naturally taking the lead. Singapore\u2019s transition to a Smart Nation and its data hub ambitions are about sustainability and survival through capitalising data, with the challenges of calibrating this against protecting the interests of its people. All policymakers whose work touches personal data, not just the Data Protection Officer or even Personal Data Protection Commission, must continue to be closely attuned to the ramifications of this current paradigm of digital data exploitation, as digitalisation reveals aspects of peoples\u2019 lives that were once not so easily observed in an analogue world. Personal data finding its way into the wrong hands is dangerous, and personal data taken out of context can be weaponised against individuals and those closest to them. The value of personal data is at once tangible and intangible - beyond notions of economic utility, the matter of data privacy strikes further and deeper: while personal data manifests our identities, more fundamentally it is about the natural right to be left alone. This is the ability to decide the parameters of acceptable intrusions of informational, physical, and communicational privacy, which is priceless. Ultimately, it stands to reason that if the ability to control and deal in personal data is taken away from an individual, the ability for personal self-determination and free will \u2013 the power to decide one\u2019s thoughts and actions \u2013 is also then threatened."

    "title": "Buddhist Nationalism in Asia: What It Means for Europe",
    "author(s)": "By Rafal K. Stepien",
    "date": "No. 119 \u2013 6 August 2021",
    "content": "RELIGIOUS NATIONALISM, religious extremism, the rise of the religious far-right\u2026 headlines worldwide proclaim the fact that, far from dissipating into irrelevance in secular post-modernity, religion is alive \u2013 and kicking. While much has been made in the European context of the challenges of Islamism among immigrant communities and of attacks on the rule of law in the conservative Christian strongholds of the European Union\u2019s East, Buddhist brands of religious nationalism in Asia have passed largely unnoticed. But as tensions between Buddhist and Muslim communities in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and Thailand continue to spill over into overt violence, the need to investigate the implications for the religiously plural democracies of Europe becomes ever more urgent. Violence and Victimisation In the Buddhist-majority countries of South and Southeast Asia, popular resentment against perceived injustices involving Muslim neighbours has led to observable shifts in the political landscape. Thus, groups such as the hardline Sinhalese Buddhist nationalist Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) or Buddhist Power Force in Sri Lanka and the radical Pandin Dharma Party in Thailand have consolidated their recently won popular gains by continuing to peddle the need for armed protection on behalf of a Buddhism purportedly under existential threat from Islam. the state-sponsored military persecution of In Myanmar, the stateless and predominantly Muslim Rohingya people has proceeded on such a scale that in 2020 the International Court of Justice (ICJ) unanimously ruled to adopt \u201cprovisional measures\u201d requiring Myanmar to prevent outright genocide. The moral arguments for mediation are clear, but why intervene? What\u2019s in it politically for Europe? Politics and Geopolitics While Buddhists make up less than a single percent of the European population (a figure not forecasted to increase), the Pew Research Centre estimates that Muslims will make up a full 10% of the overall population of Europe by 2050. Given so, the relevance to Europe of the turn towards intolerance by some South and Southeast Asian nations lies not so much with the perpetrators as with the victims. If current trends continue, political parties within Europe will need to adopt concrete counter-measures or face losses among an increasing Muslim electorate: A direct long-term consequence of the changing demands of democratic representation as the European population increasingly comes to embody the continent\u2019s pluralist ethos. Geopolitical factors also need to be weighed. The alleged imprisonment, surveillance, and even forced sterilisation of vast numbers of overwhelmingly Muslim Uighurs by the Chinese government has been labelled genocide by the US government, and organisations including Amnesty and Human Rights Watch have published reports accusing China of crimes against humanity. More recently, the EU Council imposed sanctions on associated Chinese officials as part of its newly founded global human rights sanction regime. Violence against Muslims in South and Southeast Asia is only likely to intensify given the support it continues to receive from Buddhist political players in the region. In light of this, the increasingly tough stance European powers adopt with regard to the Uighurs of China may have to be replicated with respect to the disenfranchised Muslims of Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and Thailand. Otherwise, not only will charges of hypocrisy ensue, but European states will find it harder to countenance the influence of China on domestic as well as international political stages. Furthermore, the religiously fuelled inter-ethnic fighting already seen may easily spill over into broader armed conflict. This in turn would further destabilise the region, threatening the security of European political and economic interests there. Shifting Trends in Mediation and Conflict Transformation Given the strong reasons in support of intervention, the question of how to intervene naturally arises. Although the EU has not tended to rely on religious groups on the ground to foster conflict resolution, this is likely to shift following the appointment in 2016 of the bloc\u2019s first-ever Special Envoy for the promotion of freedom of religion and belief (FoRB) outside the European Union. The European Parliament has in fact already proven attentive to issues in FoRB facing religious minorities worldwide, as evinced by the work of its Intergroup on Freedom of Religion or Belief and Religious Tolerance. The European Commission\u2019s Department of Migration and Home Affairs, meanwhile, has founded both a Radicalisation Awareness Network (RAN) of frontline practitioners and a Network for Religious and Traditional Peacemakers \u201cleading, funding, and supporting training for the diplomatic and international community, as well as religious and traditional peacemakers on engaging religious worldviews in peacemaking and peacebuilding processes, particularly in peace mediation\u201d and preventing violent extremism (PVE). Religion, Politics & Conflict Moreover, independently of the peacemaking and reconciliation role EU agencies may foster among religious stakeholders in conflict situations, European institutions at governmental and non-governmental levels themselves have extensive experience in mediating religiously-motivated conflicts. Thus, the Network for Religious and Traditional Peacemakers, based in Finland and closely supported by the UN Mediation Support Unit and the United Nations Alliance of Civilisations (UNAOC), \u201cbuilds bridges between grassroots peacemakers and global players in order to strengthen the work done for sustainable peace\u201d. Outside the EU but wholeheartedly within Europe, furthermore, the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs of Switzerland has launched a Thematic Area concerned with \u2018Religion, Politics, Conflict\u2019 devoted to finding concrete solutions leading to the renunciation of violence and the restoration of peaceful coexistence. More specifically pertinent to the problem of Buddhist nationalism, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) based in Geneva recently launched a webinar series on Buddhism and International Humanitarian Law (IHL) designed to explore the mutual relevance of the Buddhist and IHL ethical and legal traditions. Complex Challenges Naturally, the modes and means of involvement will differ among actors. EU agencies and states, for example, may permit themselves a level of overt interventionism incompatible with the historically enshrined principle of neutrality in Switzerland or the fundamental principles of impartiality and independence of the Red Cross. But this diversity of approaches may itself enable advances unavailable to any individual initiative alone. Nonetheless, although European actors have a long history of contributing to conflict de-escalation, mediation, and reconciliation in diverse contexts, effective engagement with Buddhist nationalists in South and Southeast Asia faces distinct strategic challenges. Apart from obvious cultural barriers, the political and commercial interests of global players including China and the United States will need to be accounted for. Pressure is also growing on majority-Muslim nations in the region such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Pakistan to intervene on behalf of their beleaguered co-religionists. Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has already denounced Myanmar\u2019s persecution of the Rohingya as a genocide, and increased intervention by Islamic powers is predicted. This means that whatever avenues of action Europe may take will need to be more broad-based and involve non-European countries. Regardless of the complexities and challenges, however, one fact emerges clearly from ongoing analyses: Europe cannot afford to ignore the rise of Buddhist nationalism in Asia. Already implicating a multitude of factors and actors, its importance will only grow as the inter-religious conflicts it causes continue to deepen."

    "title": "Open Russo-Ukrainian Conflict In the Making?",
    "author(s)": "By Christopher Cheang",
    "date": "No. 066 \u2013 22 April 2021",
    "content": "SINCE LATE March 2021, media reports and some observers have postulated about the possibility of an open conflict between Russia and Ukraine. This follows the deaths of four Ukrainian soldiers in a battle against Russian-backed separatists in the Donetsk Region of eastern Ukraine; deployment of Russian forces on the border; and statements by Western and Russian officials in reaction. President Joseph Biden expressed \u201cunwavering support for Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russia\u2019s ongoing aggression in the Donbas and Crimea\u201d to his Ukrainian counterpart, President Volodymyr Zelensky on 2 April. EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson conveyed their concerns, similarly pledging their support for Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity. A NATO spokesman conveyed the alliance\u2019s support in the same vein while a Franco-German statement emphasised the same point. NATO Membership for Ukraine? NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg repeated NATO\u2019s stance during a call with President Zelensky on 6 April. On his part, the Ukrainian leader, in a tweet after the call, stressed that Ukrainian membership of \u201cNATO is the only way to end the war in Donbas. Ukraine's MAP will be a real signal for Russia\u201d. His government has expressed the hope that Ukraine would be invited this year to join NATO\u2019s Membership Action Plan (MAP), which is essentially a step designed for aspirants to NATO membership. On Russia\u2019s part, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stressed that Russia was \"moving troops within its own territory at its own discretion, and this shouldn't concern anyone\u201d. Reacting to Zelensky\u2019s call for NATO MAP to be implemented, Peskov told reporters that NATO membership for Ukraine would not help it to resolve the separatist issue but \u201cwill only worsen the situation\". Russia has been consistently arguing against NATO membership for Ukraine. The Deputy Head of the presidential administration, Dmitri Kozak, said on 9 April that Moscow would defend the separatist regions. \"Everything depends on the scale of the conflagration,\" adding that an escalation could mark the \"beginning of the end\" for Ukraine. President Zelensky was at the frontline on 9 April as well, in what is seen as a morale- boosting visit. Nevertheless, a military clash between Russia and Ukraine is not imminent for the following reasons: Russo-EU relations Nord Stream 2 This gas pipeline project to Germany is crucial to Russia\u2019s gas sector as well as Russia\u2019s politico-strategic objectives in Europe. Opposed by the US and some EU countries, it is almost completed and despite long-standing US pressure, is still supported by Germany\u2019s leaders. A Russian-Ukrainian war, irrespective of who makes the first move, would place the viability of the Nord Stream 2 project in dire straits, even after its completion. Should hostilities break out before its completion, that would drive the final nail into the coffin of the project. Russian vaccine The pandemic has brought both Russia and the EU to the realisation that cooperation is required to manage and eliminate it. To this end, the European Medicines Agency started a review of the Russian vaccine, Sputnik V, in March. Reportedly, supplies have already arrived in Hungary and Slovakia, with Austria currently engaged in talks for it as well. Germany\u2019s health minister has also said Germany would be discussing with Russia the supply of the vaccine while the German state of Bavaria has reportedly placed advanced orders for it. There have also been reports that joint production in EU countries could begin, after the vaccine\u2019s registration. Russia\u2019s vaccine acts not only as a source of revenue, but also as an extension of its \u201csoft power\u201d and might help ease tensions with the EU; however, a war with Ukraine would lead to more strained relations with the EU and jeopardise its vaccine diplomacy. Russo-US relations Despite the Russian outcry over President Biden\u2019s \u201ckiller\u201d remark about his Russian counterpart and the consequent recall of Russian Ambassador Anatoly Antonov to Moscow for consultations, Russo-US relations, while tense, have not totally broken down. Climate conference This fact is testified by President Vladimir Putin\u2019s reported acceptance of Biden\u2019s invitation to attend a live streamed Leaders\u2019 Summit on Climate that he will host on 22-23 April. President Xi Jinping and Putin are among 40 world leaders invited to this meeting. Space cooperation Russia extended a space cooperation agreement with the US on 3 April. The original cooperation agreement, signed in 1992 and extended four times previously, provided the basis for projects between NASA and Roskosmos. Biden-Putin phone chat President Biden spoke with President Putin on 13 April and \u201cproposed a summit meeting in a third country in the coming months to discuss the full range of issues facing the US and Russia\u201d. The US\u2019 latest sanctions on Russia covering the financial, economic and diplomatic sectors have cast a cloud on a possible summit but might act to deter Russian military action against Ukraine. US/EU Support for Ukraine In the face of the pandemic and their concomitant socio-economic and political challenges, the US or the EU cannot support to the hilt, any unprovoked Ukrainian military thrust into the separatist regions. Moreover, as long it is not a NATO member, Ukraine cannot reckon with full Western military assistance for any offensive military action against its separatist regions. Ukraine itself has stated that it does not plan any offensive action, according to a statement released on 9 April by Ruslan Khomchak, chief of the general staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Geopolitical Considerations The Russian military build-up is meant to show the flag to the Ukrainians as well as the West that Russian support for separatist regions remains strong. However, Russian actions might lead to a situation it does not desire namely the introduction of Western military forces into Ukraine. NATO/US troops could be invited or be deployed into Ukraine during or after an open Russo-Ukrainian conflict \u2013 a prospect Russia would not relish. Hence, Russia is unlikely to provide the West with any reason to take such a step. An open Russo-Ukrainian military conflict would mean the political danse macabre for Russo-Western relations. Unlike Georgia, Ukraine lies in a very strategic corner of Europe and such a conflict would bring home to the Europeans the immediate challenge that Russian military power poses to their security. A full break with the West might also lead to Russia having no other choice but to finally and fully throw in its lot with China. Such a move would go against the prevailing grain of Russian strategic thought as it would mean a significant loss of Russian strategic manoeuvre and independence vis-\u00e0-vis China and the US. Hence, President Putin will not make such an injudicious move against Ukraine."

    "title": "Asian Multilateralism in Uncertain Times ADMM-Plus\u2019 Next Phase: Whither Defence Diplomacy?",
    "author(s)": "By Lindsey W. Ford",
    "date": "No. 014 \u2013 26 January 2021",
    "content": "THE ASEAN Defence Ministers Meeting-Plus (ADMM-Plus) has been an unlikely success story for Asian multilateralism. As the organisation celebrates its 10th anniversary, the deteriorating Asian security environment raises questions about whether regional security institutions remain fit for purpose. Looking ahead to its next phase, the ADMM-Plus should consider three sets of issues that regional security institutions must be better poised to address: the continued inability of Asian institutions to drive coordinated responses to transnational security crises; a resurgence of strategic competition; and the need for Asian defence establishments to build collective capacity. Impact of 2020: Three Challenges for Asian Defence Institutions The COVID-19 epidemic has reaffirmed the interconnected nature of the Indo-Pacific region, but it has also provided a reminder that despite a proliferation of regional agreements, institutions, and exercises focused on transnational security threats, regional defence establishments still lack much needed capacity to prepare for and respond to these problems in a collective manner. This assessment is, of course, not new. Limitations in the regional response to the 2014 MH-370 disaster, difficulties in mustering an integrated response to the resurgence of violent extremism, as well as ongoing challenges in dealing collectively with transnational crime and illegal fishing, are all well known. Even as the COVID-19 crisis has affirmed the value of regional connectivity, growing strategic competition is creating fissures within regional institutions. Regional defence diplomacy is shifting away from ASEAN\u2019s preferred model of broad, inclusive institutions and toward a greater emphasis on smaller, mini-lateral forums. The reestablishment of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue between Australia, India, Japan and the United States (\u201cQuad\u201d) has dominated headlines, but mechanisms such as the ASEAN Our Eyes Initiative (AEOI) and new trilateral dialogues between countries including Indonesia, India, and Australia all point to a growing trend toward a narrower form of multilateralism. Finally, on the fiscal front, COVID-19 is placing renewed stress on regional defence budgets, creating starker choices for national defence establishments over which missions, investments, and platforms matter most. This problem is likely to accelerate in the coming years, both as the long-term economic impact of the epidemic is more clearly felt, and as the US military feels pressure to prioritise higher-end investments over lower-end presence and capacity-building activities. Faced with newly constrained budgets, some countries may choose to cut back on needed investments and prioritise personnel costs, a trend that would exacerbate existing capacity problems, increasing the risk that emerging threats and crises may escalate. Defence Diplomacy Priorities for the Future There are no easy solutions to these problems, but they point to the need for regional defence institutions to put a new emphasis on building collective capacity. To maintain credibility, institutions such as the ADMM and the ADMM-Plus must be able to demonstrate that they can deliver not just dialogue, but also problem-solving capabilities. The ADMM is the forum of ASEAN defence ministers while ADMM-Plus is the forum\u2019s dialogue process with its security partners. To begin addressing this task, regional defence diplomacy should focus on three priorities: \u2022 Information Sharing and Transparency: The ASEAN Outlook highlights the value of transparency, but national defence establishments have all too often shied away from the types of information-sharing that will be necessary to better prevent and respond to emerging security threats. As we have seen during the current COVID-19 epidemic, the absence of strong regional information sharing mechanisms can perpetuate and deepen existing mistrust between countries in the region, a problem that will only be exacerbated by a more competitive Indo-Pacific security environment. On issues such as pandemic prevention and management, counter-terrorism, environmental monitoring, and maritime domain awareness, countries could build on existing cooperation to develop the real-time information sharing capabilities that will be needed to more effectively address future crises. \u2022 Rapid Response Mechanisms: In addition to enhanced information sharing, regional defence institutions should accelerate efforts to build collective crisis response capabilities. ASEAN\u2019s work establishing the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance (AHA Centre), building regional stockpiles and emergency response warehouses, as well as recent efforts to operationalise an ASEAN Militaries Ready Group (AMRG) are valuable steps in the right direction. But these efforts will need to be strengthened and expanded. Operationalisation of the AMRG could provide a needed proof of concept to help build momentum for ADMM discussions on additional types of standing capabilities and response mechanisms to address transnational threats in the region. \u2022 New Coalition Models and Partnerships: An additional priority for regional defence diplomacy should be to help provide a more coherent agenda for the expanding array of militaries with a presence and interest in the Indo-Pacific region. In the past several months, several European partners have begun developing plans to enhance their military activities in the Indo-Pacific theatre. Indian Ocean littoral states have also become more engaged in discussions about Indo-Pacific security. This wider constellation of players is not currently reflected in the regional defence architecture, however, which remains geographically oriented around the Asia-Pacific region. From a practical and operational perspective, there would be significant tradeoffs associated with expanding the formal membership of institutions such as the ADMM- Plus. However, it may arguably become problematic for regional defence institutions to remain disconnected from emerging regional security dialogues and cooperation mechanisms increasingly oriented around an \u201cIndo-Pacific\u201d perspective. Going forward, regional militaries should explore new mechanisms and activities that will better link Indian Ocean and European partners to Asia-Pacific defence institutions. Filling the Void Over the past decade, the ADMM-Plus has filled an important void in regional defence cooperation, creating a venue in which participating defence establishments can begin to develop practical cooperation mechanisms. But the Asia-Pacific region has evolved significantly over the past decade and its defence institutions will need to evolve as well. Put simply, unless existing institutions can begin to lead in building effective problem- solving mechanisms, they risk finding themselves sidelined by new alternatives. To do so, regional institutions will need to strengthen nascent cooperation mechanisms with new financial and operational resources. They also need to more effectively link their efforts to a broader constellation of interested partners who have additional capacity they can bring to bear."

    "title": "Malaysia\u2019s Ageing Population: What It Means for Singapore",
    "author(s)": "By Jose Ricardo S. Domingo",
    "date": "No. 205 \u2013 1 December 2020",
    "content": "IN MARCH 2020, the Malaysian government enforced the first of a series of Movement Control Orders (MCOs) to curb the spread of COVID-19 by restricting movement within the country and across its borders. This included the Johor-Singapore Causeway and the Malaysia-Singapore Second Link, effectively closing one of world\u2019s busiest borders. Thousands of Malaysians and Singaporeans, along with businesses that rely on them, had to make difficult decisions on where they should remain in the meantime. The closing of borders by both sides has exposed both the deep personal ties and economic interdependency between the two nations. Cross-Border Trends Malaysia\u2019s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hishammuddin Hussein, was quoted by The Star in July 2020, and said that between 200,000 to 250,000 people passed through these border crossings daily. In September, Johor\u2019s Menteri Besar (Chief Minister), Hasni Mohammad, expressed deep concern for some 100,000 Malaysians, who may lose their jobs due to prolonged border closure, as reported by news outlets. Malaysians regularly travelled through these crossings to Singapore for work or school, while Singaporeans often visited Johor for day trips. Some Singaporeans also resided in Johor and commuted daily to Singapore. Businesses in Johor that were dependent on tourists from Singapore have been severely affected. Hasni also said in September that about five per cent to 10% of businesses had stopped operating in Johor due to the border closing, and some have seen revenue declines of up to 70%. Prolonged border control measures against COVID-19 have highlighted broader concerns for both countries' reliance on foreign labour. Although these will likely subside along with the pandemic, both face long-term demographic trends that are harder to manage. Singapore\u2019s Dependency on Malaysian Migrants While Malaysia is reliant on foreigners mostly for work, Singapore\u2019s far smaller population has relied on immigration not only for its economy, but also for population growth. According to the United Nations, most of the migrants in Singapore are Malaysian. Based on their estimates, Malaysians in Singapore numbered 952,621 people (2019). They comprised 44.2% of Singapore\u2019s own foreign-born population or migrant stock, which includes naturalised citizens, permanent residents, students, work pass holders and their dependents. The next closest to Malaysians were migrants from China at 17.6%, and Indonesia at 6.4% of Singapore\u2019s foreign population. The high number of Malaysians in Singapore is likely due to proximity and cultural affinity, which makes it easier for Malaysians to integrate with Singaporeans. While Malaysians comprise the largest group of Singapore\u2019s migrant stock, fewer Malaysians may be headed to Singapore towards 2040 and beyond, when Malaysia becomes an aged country. Malaysia\u2019s Ageing Population Today, Malaysia is estimated to be an ageing nation, with seven per cent of its population aged 65 years old and above. A country is defined as \u201caged\u201d when more than 14% of its population is 65 years old or higher. When this figure exceeds 20%, it is \u201csuper-aged\u201d. By 2040, the Department of Statistics Malaysia estimated that 14.5% of its population will be 65 and older. Last month, the World Bank also released a report that estimated Malaysia to reach the aged country status by 2044. At the same time, the country\u2019s birth rate has been below replacement levels since 2012 and continues to decline gradually. The UN projects Malaysia\u2019s total fertility rate (TFR) \u2013 the average number of children born to a woman \u2013 to eventually dip to 1.731, below replacement, between 2040 to 2045. The country\u2019s current population is estimated at 32.7 million people, 69.7% of which are between 15-64 years old (working age group). The next biggest group is those aged 14 years old and under (dependents), who make up 23.3% of the population. They are rounded out by those 65 years old and above (the elderly), at seven per cent. Nevertheless, Malaysia\u2019s population is still relatively youthful compared to some of its ASEAN neighbours such as Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Malaysia\u2019s current median age is estimated at 29.2, while Singapore\u2019s is at 41.1. By 2040, Malaysia\u2019s median age is projected to become 38.3 years old. The Malaysian government has acknowledged that a gradual ageing and growing long-term challenges, such as economic elderly population present serious sustainability, retirement security, and adequacy of elder healthcare. Last September, Khazanah Research Institute released a report that stated that nearly 40% of Malaysian workers did not have retirement savings plans, while the World Bank\u2019s November report highlighted these challenges. Malaysia\u2019s Ageing and its Migration Flows A future elderly Malaysian population could also slow its migration flows. It would have a smaller portion of the working age, and a growing number of retirees. With a smaller and older workforce, demand for labour could grow in Malaysia. The Malaysian government could respond by controlling the flow of its own emigrants and make the country a more attractive option for work. Malaysia\u2019s ageing population could also increase the country\u2019s own inward migration flow. Indeed, the government has ramped up efforts to attract members of the Malaysian diaspora to return to the country and contribute to the economy. Their experiences and expertise would be valuable in terms of skills-sharing and knowledge- transfer. These factors could make it difficult in the future for Singapore to attract and retain Malaysian migrants, especially the young. If Singapore continues to rely on foreign workers, the government may have to raise wages and provide further benefits for Malaysians or look elsewhere to replace the potentially lost labour. Singapore\u2019s Own Ageing Population The Singaporean government is also dealing with its own ageing population and has been exploring a combination of solutions to reduce its labour requirements and increase the employability and productivity of its elderly. In fact, Malaysian migrant flows to Singapore appear to have slowed down. From 1990 to 2015, UN estimates showed that Malaysian migrants in Singapore were increasing in five-year intervals. However, when compared between 2015 and 2019, UN estimates show that total migrants (including Malaysians) in Singapore actually decreased by 15.3%. Interestingly, Malaysian migrants decreased by 15.3% in 2019 as well. While this recent slowdown may not be due to Malaysia\u2019s ageing population, it could contribute to a trend leading towards 2040 and beyond. Will Singapore Tap Other ASEAN Countries More? Today, re-opening the border between Singapore and Malaysia remains a pressing issue. Malaysia and Singapore initiated a Reciprocal Green Lane (RGL) and a Periodic Commuting Agreement (PCA) in August to allow some form of minimal business travel between the two countries but the numbers were a far cry from the old border traffic. Talks are underway between the two countries to formalise Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for a daily commute scheme between Singapore and Johor. This could, however, take some time. Most states in Peninsular Malaysia were recently put under a Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO) in November, until 6 December 2020, including Johor. However, the state\u2019s CMCO was lifted on 21 November, and the government announced a targeted CMCO within the Batu Pahat district from 29 November to 13 December. For the longer term, Singapore would have to consider how its labour and population growth needs might evolve. Artificial Intelligence and automation could reduce future manpower needs. The government may also diversify sources of immigration and tap other ASEAN countries more. This would in turn require a review of the fundamental make-up of Singapore\u2019s population \u2013 and therefore, that of its economy and society."

    "title": "US Presidential Election 2020 Polling the Politicians: Pitfalls and Perils",
    "author(s)": "By Adam Garfinkle",
    "date": "No. 181 \u2013 20 October 2020",
    "content": "LAST MONTH, we noted three rogue factors bearing down simultaneously on the fast- approaching United States presidential election, rendering it the most accident-prone and unpredictable in American history: multipartite foreign interference; the logistical complications of voting in the time of pandemic; and a president who, uniquely in US history, has stated publicly and repeatedly that he will refuse to recognise the legitimacy of any election he does not win and will not concede defeat. A fourth predictable rogue factor has since appeared: President Trump\u2019s 1-2 October 2020 revelation that he tested positive for COVID-19. To this shock was soon added the spectacle of his muscling his doctors to claim that he was COVID-free, and his ongoing attempt to politicise his own medical adventures to advantage. More Rogue Factor: Polling the Politicians Thanks to an unbroken record of White House mendacity over the past nearly four years, we still cannot be sure if the entire episode was not a hoax designed to evoke sympathy, and turn around what are ghastly polls for the Republicans, but that seems highly unlikely given the epidemiological nightmare that is the White House right now. Assuming it was not a hoax, we still cannot be sure if the president\u2019s \u201ccure\u201d, near to singular for an overweight 74-year old male anywhere in the world, is real; or his most perilous period lies just ahead. That\u2019s a lot not to know on the eve of a critical election. Alas, a fifth rogue factor has emerged, though it is more a constant in recent American elections: the impact of published polls. Few Americans realise it, but most of the polls we read or hear about in the media are not social science-valid exercises. These polls bear little resemblance to those many learned about in their undergraduate political science classes. Polling is a business in the US and in many other countries where opinion surveys have become part of the democratic ethos, and the customers are the media corporations that buy them. Why do they buy them? Because survey research \u2500 another kind of polling \u2500 shows that people are attracted to polls as big news, at least when they can be presented in very simple ways, dressed up with eye-catching graphs or charts, and associated with pulsating news \u201chooks\u201d. Opinion Polling or Gossip? Commercial political opinion polling is really just gossip in the plural tense at a time when politics has become more of a series of reality-TV episodes than anything like Max Weber\u2019s \u201cvocation\u201d. Polls can even be made clickbait-attractive to niche audiences, such as the recent Carnegie poll entitled \u201cHow Will Indian Americans Vote?\u201d. When those kinds of boxes can be checked, commercial polling is good and often big business. And why in turn is that? Because, as Friedrich Nietzsche put it in Beyond Good and Evil in 1886: \u201cWere it not for the constant counterfeiting of the world by means of numbers, men could not live.\u201d Numbers create a false sense of concreteness, a simulacrum of certainty about reality that, for many, renders the complex simple. After all, few have time and opportunity to learn about the various methodologies of polling and their relatives and merits and deficiencies, such as coverage distortions, mismeasurement and misweighting, non-response factoring, and others. So when they see a number that magically seems to produce clarity from confusion on a topic they care about, they cling to it as if by mental reflex. This is unfortunate, because many commercial political polls have proved notoriously unreliable. The pollsters in Britain got Brexit so very wrong. Some years before that pollsters in Europe mispredicted the results of referenda concerning the European Union, notably in France and the Netherlands. And then, most memorably, they botched spectacularly the November 2016 US election, as well. We know the reasons. One is conscious bias, and another is unrecognised bias that seeps into the way questions are asked and interpreted. Bias in Polling Conscious bias is designed to produce polling news that either mobilises or demobilises constituencies \u2500 donors long before the time to vote as well as voters nearer to balloting day. Unrecognised bias leads those who design and choose methodologies and sample sizes, for example, to cause the over-representation of some social groups of voters and the under-representation of others. In 2016, pollsters, either themselves being or relying on highly educated social scientists, designed questions, selected samples, and used techniques like \u201copt-in\u201d the minority of college-educated people (like panels themselves) in a newly populist political environment. that over-represented Note that unrecognised bias can apply to serious polling efforts as well as to commercial ones. Hardly any American political scientist predicted Trump\u2019s victory in 2016. A seminal 1964 essay by Philip Converse on the striation of public opinion and style of assimilating political information has evidently still not sunk into the typical academic pollster\u2019s mental apparatus. A third reason concerns technology. It is now much easier for commercial polling start- ups to surmount barriers to entry thanks to the equalising effects of powerful and easy- to-use computer data manipulation. The new technical power at hand has caused ferment in sampling techniques, leading some to combine online surveying with robocalling and other methods, and then claim, non-transparently most of the time, huge reassuring sampling sizes and small error margins that are, to put it bluntly, bogus. Why Polling Faults Matter These infirmities matter today as they did in 2016, when optimistic polls helped persuade Hillary Clinton not to campaign in important swing states late in the campaign season. When polls say that Biden is so far ahead that Trump barely has any chance, it gives rise to a secondary media meme whose premise has the effect of persuading many people that their vote doesn\u2019t matter. That has two intertwined effects: It may, under the special circumstances of this upcoming election, reduce pro-Biden voter turnout on election day, for those unable or unwilling to vote by mail; and it may cause the redoubling of anti-Biden energies from the White House and supporters nationwide out to the far sticks. The presumption of a Biden victory in November may also have affected Biden\u2019s choice of Kamala Harris to be his running mate. If Biden thought he might lose, his choice would have logically been taken with a priority on who would help him win key swing states \u2500 like first-term Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, if indeed it had to be a woman. But if he thought he was going to win in a breeze, his choice might well have turned instead on who would be most likely to heal, or paper over for optical purposes, fissures within the Democratic Party. He believed the polls, so it\u2019s Biden-Harris \u2500 a choice that risks some centrist Democratic and independent support. How all of this will come out in the wash after 3 November we\u2019ll all just have to wait and see. When it does, we won\u2019t need a poll to tell us the answer."

    "title": "EU-China Sanctions Tussle: Winners and Losers",
    "author(s)": "By Frederick Kliem",
    "date": "No. 058 \u2013 8 April 2021",
    "content": "EUROPEANS ARE often quick to reserve the right to sanction third-party states on normative grounds. This happened again last week, when the latest round of European Union sanctions targeted the usual suspects, including Russia and Myanmar. What was new was that China has made it on to the EU sanctions list on human rights grounds for the first time since Tiananmen. With this, European institutions joined the United States and others, targeting four senior Chinese officials and one entity for human-rights violations in Xinjiang. Targeted Sanctions and Countersanctions The EU has an ambivalent relationship with China. There is an omnipresent power tussle among the EU institutions as well as among member states over the right balance between economic interests and normative imperatives, a struggle between national economic interests and the EU\u2019s normative global ambitions. Germany, for example, has long caused frustration among those in the EU who believe engagement with China should focus much more on questions such as human rights. This \u2018lobby\u2019 includes the more forward leaning member states and, importantly, the EU Parliament which largely sees itself as Europe\u2019s normative guardian. Human rights abuses are serious and must receive international attention. But it is common wisdom that the efficacy of sanctions is low, perhaps counter-productive. In the EU, the primary objective of sanctions is, therefore, not an improvement inside the target country. Instead, sanctions are an instrument of public diplomacy, a symbol of international protest, and not least addressing domestic public opinion and appeasing political dynamics inside the EU. EU\u2019s First Dilemma: How to React Navigating the dilemma of having to react robustly without causing too much trouble for the sanctioned country is achieved by targeting a handful of lower-ranking individuals and entities with modest measures, including travel bans and asset freezing. This way, the targeted country is only minimally affected, often not even worth a reaction. Not so this time. While EU officials would have expected a Chinese reaction, they had not expected Beijing lashing out as they did, with countersanctions on ten European individuals and four entities, including the EU Parliament\u2019s Subcommittee on Human Rights, parliamentarians (including the EU Parliament\u2019s greatest China critic, the prominent German Green-MEP B\u00fctikofer), diplomats and think tanks. Just like in Europe, Chinese sanctions are an instrument of public diplomacy. China is not a small developing country but a superpower, and Beijing cannot be seen as passively accepting international sanctions. A Dicey Investment Deal Germany\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel is its export driven economy and the automobile industry in particular. It is no surprise that German Chancellor Angela Merkel was instrumental in concluding the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI). This is an investment deal with which the EU hopes to level the hitherto asymmetric playing field for foreign businesses in China, long a serious concern in the EU, and Germany in particular. Many EU MEPs, B\u00fctikofer included, were critical of the other EU institutions\u2019 and CAI\u2019s ignorance towards poor human rights standards in China, including forced labour. And while Commission and Council can negotiate and approve the agreement, it is ultimately the EU Parliament that must give its consent for ratification. Parliamentarians cancelled a meeting to discuss the deal in protest over China\u2019s reaction. Of course, China must have predicted this reaction, leaving only one conclusion: Beijing is signalling that they do not need to open up to the EU. EU\u2019s Second Dilemma: Two Losers, One Winner The EU now faces a dilemma. While Chinese sanctions are equally toothless, the difference to Brussels\u2019 sanctions is that Beijing\u2019s are clearly punitive, therefore highly confrontational. This audacity enraged MEPs, many of whom had already been critical of CAI, the Greens in particular. When the agreement now returns from \u201clegal scrubbing\u201d and official translation to Parliament for ratification, Beijing\u2019s countersanctions jeopardise the outcome many national governments were hoping for. There is still time for intra-EU diplomacy to convince a critical number of MEPs to support CAI. Should the agreement be rejected, however, it will be European industry that loses out, not China. And yet, the atmosphere in Beijing is barely festive. As is often the case, inept Chinese diplomacy is better at assembling a coalition of opponents than its actual opponents are. US-EU Anti-China Alliance? With its counter-sanctions Beijing has undermined its own objectives. With CAI, China attempted to drive a wedge between Washington and Europe, with success. Although the vast majority of European leaders eagerly awaited a \u201cnew beginning\u201d post-Trump, Europe threw Joe Biden a curveball by rushing through CAI just before his inauguration, instead of waiting to coordinate with Washington\u2019s new China policy. The White House reaction was more than icy, leading to an early diplomatic tussle between Washington and European capitals. But EU-China relations are taking a nose-dive just as the new US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken arrived for his first official Europe visit. The tit-for-tat sanctions are a diplomatic manna for the US, and a stumbling block for those in China \u2014 and inside Europe \u2014 who argue that the EU should dissociate itself from Washington. For the foreseeable future, a united US-EU anti-China alliance is unlikely. But Washington has done better than Brussels by delicately producing a \u2018frenemy\u2019 relationship with Beijing out of last week\u2019s Alaska talks. The unintended consequence of technically harmless EU sanctions show how easily diplomatic dynamics can spiral out of control, possibly with lasting impact on the global balance of power among Brussels, Beijing and Washington."

    "author(s)": "By Irm Haleem",
    "date": "No. 190 \u2013 3 November 2020",
    "content": "TO HIS supporters, President Trump is a patriot of the highest order. He is seen as a \u2018regular\u2019 man who understands the \u2018regular\u2019 working Americans, a faithful Christian, and a saviour of a bleeding nation that has given too much to the world and gotten very little in return. In their view, the United States has suffered from the liberals\u2019 agenda which resulted in permeable borders and weak immigration policies that has increased crime in America and has overburdened its social welfare system. For Americans who support Biden, Trump has been a divisive president who has created Nazi-esque camps as a \u2018holding pattern\u2019 for illegal immigrants before their deportation, put children of illegal immigrants in cages, created a nonsensical Muslim Ban that exempted the very country that represented the nationality of the majority of the 9-11 terrorists. Trump is regarded as a president with shattered legitimacy upon being impeached by the US House of Representatives, a president who has failed in response to COVID-19 pandemic by belittling its threat and placing the blame on the \u2018China virus\u2019 that has generated anti-Chinese racism in America. This president has emboldened the violent far-right militia by failing to condemn their hatred and violence, and by instructing them to \u2018stand back, stand by\u2019. Adding to the objectionable policy positions taken by Trump and his character flaws, the Biden supporters are also concerned with the American electoral system, where a candidate does not win by a majority of the popular vote, but by securing the required number of electoral college votes. What is the Electoral College? The US presidential election rests on the \u2018electoral college\u2019 system. This \u2018college\u2019 simply refers to a group of people whose job is to elect the president. In fact, when Americans go to the polls this week, on 3 November 2020, they are voting for the group of officials who make up the body of the electoral college; each state gets a certain number of electors depending on the population size of the state and the number of its representatives in the US Congress (that is, the House of Representatives and the Senate). Each elector gets one vote and each one of them is supposed to support the presidential candidate which won the most popular votes at the state level. There are a total of 538 electors from all states. The candidate receiving the votes of 270 of these electors goes to the White House in Washington DC as the President of the United States of America. The popular criticism of the American electoral system is that, basically, 538 persons determine the outcome of the US presidential elections. Some argue that this is hardly reflective of a purely democratic exercise. Contrary to widely-held belief, the occupant of the White House is chosen not by American citizens casting their votes personally but whether the presidential candidate get more votes in those states that matter. Trump won the 2016 election when a combined small margin of votes from three states swung against his contender, Hillary Clinton, and this was reflected in the eventual voting in the electoral college. Emotion Behind Trump Appeal Comments on social media posts reveal where the emotional strings lie for Trump supporters: Trump\u2019s isolationism is revered as a needed \u2018America First\u2019 policy, as patriotism of the highest order, despite the fact that US military involvement overseas was meant as a measure to guard against bringing the conflicts home. His promise of bringing troops back home is perceived as a caring for the soldiers despite his open disdain and disrespect towards key high-ranking military officers. Trump\u2019s affiliation with the conservative Republicans is understood as a marker for morality and ethical behaviour, despite the fact that Trump\u2019s open misogyny has led to 26 counts of sexual misconduct, along with a litany of other unethical behaviour. His criticism of Biden and the Democrats as being \u2018anti-police establishment\u2019 is accepted wholesale based on fears of the lawless liberals, despite the fact that Biden has rejected the \u2018Defund the Police\u2019 initiative. The Centre for Strategic and International Studies (a think tank based in Washington DC) reports that from January-August 2020, over 40 violent incidences were attributed to the violent far-right that Trump has emboldened, compared to 12 incidences from the violent far-left, and less than five incidences from violent Jihadi groups. Virus vs Politics President Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, is reported to have told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper: \u201cWe are not going to control the pandemic.\u201d The COVID-19 infection is spreading like wildfire throughout the US. Yet, wearing of mask and social distancing are being contested by political factions in the country, with Trump leading an unrelentless campaign of rejecting the scientific advice and COVID-19 protocol. This is even though he was personally struck by the coronavirus and hospitalised for a few days. The fact is that the Trump campaign gambled on the coronavirus being brought under control, and lost. It cannot change tack at this late stage of the game without political devastation. There seems a determined effort to deny health care provisions by the Trump White House. Timothy Snyder, a professor of history at Yale University, warns that \u2018America\u2019s poor health is an invitation to tyranny\u2019. Snyder notes that in \u201cnormal democracies, health care is not the preserve of an elite\u201d, but of the population at large. This is not so in America. Inaccessible health care generates fear and insecurities. Instead of a concern for the health of Americans at large, Trump has threatened to revoke the Affordable Care Act \u2013 Obamacare \u2013 that offers affordable care to middle and working class Americans, and prevents insurance companies from denying care to individuals with pre-existing conditions. The Biden Alternative In his election campaigns, Biden has promised that he will be an American president who sees no distinctions between red (Republican) states, or blue (Democratic) states, but sees only \u201cthe united states\u201d. Biden promises a progressive presidency, where his \u2018Build Back Better\u2019 agenda comprises some of the following features: a US$6 trillion over a decade to improve social and economic conditions for all Americans; a more effective contact tracing to combat the COVID-19 spread, new lockdowns if needed, and a no pay-out-pocket cost for Americans for a COVID-19 vaccine. There will also be $400 billion in investments in the economy; $300 billion for research on clean-energy initiatives; a $15 per hour federal minimum wage; support for unions; expanded Affordable Care Act; higher taxation for corporations and the wealthy; a plan to put into action Bernie Sander\u2019s \u2018College for All Act\u2019; progressive criminal justice reforms and abolition of the death penalty; and a rejection of \u2018Defund the Police\u2019 campaign of the left. The Three Scenarios Ultimately, the conclusion of the 2020 US presidential election depends on how the American system lives up to the challenges of the time \u2500 the coronavirus pandemic and its unprecedented disruption of society and economy, and the ego of Donald Trump. There are three possibilities ahead: The good scenario is one where the candidate who loses the election will gracefully yield to his contender, showcasing a healthy, strong democracy in the world\u2019s most powerful country. The bad scenario is where President Trump will declare a premature victory around 11pm on Election Day (3 November), well before all the mailed-in and absentee ballots are counted, and when these counts are completed and translate into a Biden victory, Trump will cry fraud, thereby pulling in the Department of Justice and conceivably the Supreme Court to render the final decision. The ugly scenario is where the far-right militia groups act on Trump\u2019s \u2018stand back, stand by\u2019 commandment and view it as a licence to unleash violence on American"

    "author(s)": "By Anne-Marie Schleich",
    "date": "No. 081 \u2013 18 May 2021",
    "content": "NEW ZEALAND always had a reputation for doing foreign policy its own way. Recently, New Zealand\u2019s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern explained that her government had raised \u201cgrave concerns\u201d with China on human rights issues. But she also stressed that \u201careas of difference with China\u2026need not define a relationship\u201d. The Five Eyes is an intelligence alliance comprising five Western powers \u2014 Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States. New Zealand has recently demonstrated a certain reluctance to sign up to some of the Five Eyes political declarations against China. felt that she uncomfortable about the alliance \u201cgoing beyond its remit of intelligence sharing\u201d. foreign minister said recently Its Appeasing China or Independent Player? In May 2020, only four (Australia, Canada, US and UK) of the Five Eyes members issued a statement about the impending imposition of a national security law on Hongkong; the same happened in a January 2021 Five Eyes statement about mass arrests in Hong Kong. New Zealand also did not support a recent Five Eyes declaration on the treatment of the Uyghur minority in Xinjiang. However, New Zealand joined its partners in November 2020 expressing concerns about curbs on Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy. And in March 2021, the Australian and New Zealand foreign ministers together voiced their \u201cgrowing concerns about \u2026 human rights abuses in Xinjiang\u201d. New Zealand's parliament last week unanimously passed a motion on human rights abuses against Uyghurs, but only after the word \"genocide\" was dropped from the text. International commentators have speculated whether New Zealand wants to appease China, its biggest export market, and whether it could still be trusted as a political ally. The Biden administration has been drumming up political support against China among allied partner organisations, the revived Quad quasi alliance, NATO, G7 and the Five Eyes; the role of the Five Eyes has expanded from an intelligence agency to a more politically vocal one. Contrary to Australia, New Zealand has carefully chosen the platforms for its public condemnations of China. A view back into history might help to better understand New Zealand\u2019s so called \u2018independent\u2019 foreign and security policy. Why the Independent-Minded Posture New Zealand\u2019s and Australia\u2019s geographic isolation has led both to maintain a strong military partnership with the US. The two Pacific countries have also cooperated with the US, the UK and Canada under the Five Eyes intelligence sharing agreement. The origins of this intelligence alliance date back to the 1946 \u2018UKUSA Agreement\u2019 of the Cold War era. The five partners divided their sphere of intelligence gathering. New Zealand with its main signals facility on the South Island, is responsible for gathering information in the South Pacific. Five Eyes activities were critically viewed domestically, especially because the surveillance is directed against New Zealand\u2019s close partners, the Pacific Island countries, where about 10% of the New Zealand population originates from. In the defence area, the 1951 ANZUS treaty between the Australia and New Zealand and the US was the foundation for the US military presence in the Pacific Ocean. The three countries fought side by side in the various wars since World War I. But in 1985, the Labour government led the antinuclear weapons movement in the Pacific and banned US nuclear-powered warships from New Zealand waters. The ANZUS alliance with New Zealand was frozen for 30 years while New Zealand\u2019s participation in the Five Eyes continued, though somewhat reduced. It was President Obama\u2019s \u201cPivot towards Asia\u201d policy which brought New Zealand back into the US fold. The 2012 Washington Declaration was the official icebreaker and provided a framework to reopen bilateral defence ties and allowed US naval ships back into New Zealand. Trade Dependence and Political Dilemma New Zealand\u2019s closest neighbours are the Pacific island countries and Australia. Its foreign policy is therefore primarily focused on stability at its Pacific doorsteps, close cooperation with the Pacific Island countries and on the protection of its own vast Exclusive Economic Zone. New Zealand\u2019s trade dependence on China has created enormous economic opportunities as well as a political dilemma, as it has for its neighbour Australia. China is New Zealand\u2019s biggest trading partner. New Zealand\u2019s exports quadrupled since the signing of the bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) in 2008 with bilateral trade amounting to NZ$33 billion (2019) and approximately 29% exports to China. This FTA the first that China signed with any country, was upgraded in January 2021.China is also the second largest tourism market and largest source of international students. New Zealand was a founding member of the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. It signed in 2017 a Memorandum with China for (yet unspecified) Belt and Road projects and in 2020 the RCEP trade agreement. The second Labour government under Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is able to govern without its previous coalition partner, New Zealand First, whose leader, the then Foreign Minister Winston Peters was critical of China. Now without Peters, the government can avoid an open confrontation with China \u2014 unlike its Australian neighbour. Navigating Tricky Geopolitical Waters With the US-China strategic competition intensifying, New Zealand defines its own national interests and is determined to navigate these tricky geopolitical waters. It also takes into account critical views of its intelligence operations, especially among its close partners in the Pacific. Many of them also have close political and economic ties with China. The New Zealand PM has questioned the usefulness of direct statements which she deems as mostly ineffective when dealing with China. New Zealand sees Fives Eyes as a pragmatic spying network and not as a foreign policy coordination platform bound by common political values. Its economic vulnerability to potential Chinese reprisals is not the major factor in New Zealand\u2019s foreign policy. With New Zealand continuing to cover the South Pacific intelligence flank, it can be predicted that it will stay a member of the club despite the government\u2019s occasional unwillingness to back Five Eyes political statements."

    "title": "Jokowi\u2019s Cabinet Reshuffle: Will It Beat COVID-19?",
    "author(s)": "By Richard Borsuk",
    "date": "No. 212 \u2013 24 December 2020",
    "content": "PRESIDENT JOKO Widodo\u2019s major cabinet reshuffle this week is aimed at improving Indonesia\u2019s efforts to be on top of the COVID-19 pandemic and get the country out of its first recession in more than 20 years. Six months after he rebuked his \u201cOnward Indonesia\u201d cabinet for not treating the pandemic as the crisis that it was, the president replaced the military radiologist who was health minister with a banker who is a respected manager, and dropped the trade minister for a non-politician with business experience. Jokowi, as the president is known, also filled vacancies created recently when two ministers were detained as suspects in corruption cases. Improving Cabinet\u2019s Performance The latest cabinet reshuffle \u201cpresents a few upgrades in terms of execution and public messaging,\u201d says Aaron Connelly, a research fellow with the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). With the changes, \u201chopefully there will be meaningful improvements for the wider community\u201d, tweeted social scientist Ariel Heryanto of Monash University. The most significant change in Jokowi\u2019s second-term cabinet, formed in October 2019, is the dropping of Terawan Agus Putranto as health minister, and his replacement by Budi Gunadi Sadikin, who was previously deputy minister for state-owned companies and chair of the National Economic Recovery Task Force. There has long been strong criticism of Terawan, who downplayed COVID-19 when cases first emerged in the country and told Indonesians that prayer could fend it off. Terawan struggled to work through the Health Ministry\u2019s bureaucracy, which was frustratingly slow to spend budgeted funds and increase testing from woefully inadequate levels. Replacement of Terawan \u201cwas long overdue\u201d, said Connelly, adding it was \u201cnot clear if it will improve the COVID response much, as Jokowi long ago began to work around Terawan\u201d. New Health Minister Budi will be Indonesia\u2019s first health minister who is not a doctor or have a medical background. But he is an experienced manager, and that could be just what Indonesia needs at the ministry, especially for the period of vaccination \u2500 which hopefully will start soon in 2021 but will pose huge logistical challenges. Budi has solid management credentials. He was president-director of state-owned Bank Mandiri and then ran Indonesia\u2019s mining holding company, PT Inalum, which bought majority control of the country\u2019s giant Freeport gold and copper mining operation. Another key appointment is of Muhammad Lutfi, Indonesia\u2019s ambassador to the United States, who succeeds Agus Suparmanto of the National Awakening Party (PKB) as trade minister. Lutfi was previously chairman of the Investment Coordinating Board and briefly served as trade minister in the last cabinet of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Jokowi\u2019s predecessor as president. Lutfi also has worked in the private sector. Lutfi had just presented his credentials in Washington in September, and his appointment as minister means Indonesia will be without an ambassador there when Joe Biden is sworn in as president on 20 Jan 2021. But the trade post at home is important, especially as Indonesia needs to boost exports to help end the contraction of its economy. Long-Awaited Reshuffle Consumption, and not trade, is the big engine of the Indonesian economy, accounting for more than half of GDP, but it is still sputtering because of COVID-19 and its spiking case load \u2500 which is keeping many Indonesians from shopping. The economy is expected to shrink close to two per cent this year, which has caused big increases in joblessness and poverty. As of 22 Dec 2020, Indonesia had the biggest number of COVID-19 cases in Southeast Asia \u2500 more than 650,000 \u2500 and the biggest number of deaths, about 20,000. Jokowi\u2019s cabinet reshuffle has long been expected. Some analysts prematurely projected it to come soon after he lambasted ministers in June about a lackadaisical approach to fighting the pandemic. Then in the past month, two ministers were detained as suspects in corruption cases, casting a shadow on Jokowi\u2019s government. One of those cases was particularly embarrassing as the then-social welfare minister is suspected of siphoning off money from the budget for putting a safety net for Indonesians impoverished by COVID-19. The dropped minister, Juliari Batubara, has been replaced by popular Surabaya mayor Tri Rismaharini. Coopting Another Political Opponent Also significant from the reshuffle is the appointment of Sandiaga Uno, the vice- presidential candidate who ran with Prabowo Subianto to oppose Jokowi and his running mate Ma\u2019ruf Amin in the April 2019 presidential election. Sandiaga was named the new minister of tourism and creative economy. So there is the unprecedented development in which political opponents in a presidential election subsequently joined the winning candidate\u2019s government. When forming his cabinet for the second and final term that ends in 2024, Jokowi, who likes inclusiveness, controversially made Prabowo defence minister even though the outspoken former general had rejected the legitimacy of the 2019 presidential election \u2500 as well as the previous one in 2014. Equally of note is the appointment of Yaqut Cholil Qoumas, leader of the youth wing of the giant Islamic organisation Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), as religious affairs minister in place of retired general Fachrul Razi. This portfolio has traditionally been for an NU figure, so NU was not happy to have been bypassed for the post last year. Indonesia is the world\u2019s most populous Muslim-majority country. Jokowi clearly hopes the cabinet changes give his government a fresh start with more than two-thirds of his final five-year term left. He will be judged on how Indonesia deals with COVID-19. How his government performs with the coming rollout of the massive vaccination programme will be as much a test of Jokowi\u2019s leadership."

    "title": "South China Sea: New US Policy and Its Implications",
    "author(s)": "By Olli Pekka Suorsa",
    "date": "No. 144 \u2013 16 July 2020",
    "content": "AMID GROWING tensions between the United States and China, Washington has announced a new South China Sea policy. The new policy was expressed by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on 13 July 2020 as the two powers locked horns on multiple fronts from economic and technological competition and issues over Hong Kong and Xinjiang, to the confrontation in the South China Sea. The new policy statement called out Chinese coercive actions against its Southeast Asian neighbours and promised support in protection of their respective maritime rights. The stronger US stance came after a landmark US-Japan-Australia joint statement of 7 July, condemning Chinese actions in the region. The trilateral declaration was followed by unilateral statements by Japan, Australia and India, among others, along the same tone. Why the New US Policy Pompeo\u2019s statement made the intention of the new policy crystal clear: \u201cBeijing\u2019s claims to offshore resources across most of the South China Sea are completely unlawful, as is its campaign of bullying to control them\u201d. The policy aligned the US South China Sea position closely with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the 2016 Philippines versus China international arbitration ruling, which delegitimised claims to historic rights and China\u2019s so-called nine-dashed line in the South China Sea as the basis of Beijing\u2019s claims. The statement therefore also showed Washington\u2019s strong support for the declaration made by ASEAN leaders at the end of the 36th ASEAN Summit on 26 June 2020, insisting that all maritime claims to be based on international law, and especially the UNCLOS. Not all this is new, though. Washington has consistently denounced Chinese excessive and illegal maritime claims in South China Sea, including the nine-dashed line, and has increasingly called out Chinese bullying of other South China Sea claimant states. More Explicit Tone What is different, however, is the explicit tone and message it sends to Beijing as well as allies and partners in the region that the US is doubling down on stopping China\u2019s coercive actions in the South China Sea. As a clear signal to allies and partners, the statement singles out Chinese assertive actions in the Philippines\u2019 Scarborough Shoal, Mischief Reef, and the Second Thomas Shoal, Vietnam\u2019s Vanguard Bank, Malaysia\u2019s Luconia Shoals, and Natuna Basar off Indonesia. It calls out China\u2019s harassment of coastal states\u2019 legitimate fishing and hydrocarbon development activities around those maritime features. The policy thus gives explicit US support to those states and the exercise of their rights within their respective maritime zones, receiving positive acknowledgments from the region. In addition, the support for claimants to exercise their legal rights in their respective exclusive economic zones gives Washington a new tone to its actions in the South China Sea, one that has more credibility than backing all US moves under the assertion to uphold the freedom of navigation in the region. The two need to go hand in hand. China\u2019s Response & What Lies Ahead China, unsurprisingly, was unhappy about the US statement and followed up with the rather usual tirade. Beijing lashed Washington on interfering in the region\u2019s issues and on unnecessarily escalating the situation. Beijing views the new statement as a significant shift in Washington\u2019s policy toward South China Sea, abandoning the stated neutrality on sovereignty disputes. Instead, China sees the new US policy as a direct challenge to its own position and blames Washington on putting a wedge between itself and Southeast Asian claimant states. With the South China Sea policy statement, US created itself a more explicit policy framework for activities that would deter what Pompeo accused as attempts to create a Chinese \u201cmaritime empire\u201d in the South China Sea and support the smaller Southeast Asian coastal states\u2019 rights and freedoms in their respective exclusive economic zones (EEZs). For the US, however, the real challenge still lies ahead. How Washington go on to implement the strongly-worded policy matters ultimately more than the statement itself. In a keynote speech to the tenth annual CSIS South China Sea conference, on 14 July  2020, the US Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs David Stilwell said that \u201call tools are on the table\u201d and hinted that there certainly was room to sanction Chinese officials and state-owned enterprises that engage in illegal activities. An example of possible US actions that will follow took place from late April till early May when Chinese Haiyang Dizhi 8 oil exploration vessel, flanked by Chinese maritime militia and coast guard boats, intruded into Malaysia\u2019s EEZ. Ostensibly to survey the area, the Chinese vessels harassed the Petronas-operated West Capella rig\u2019s drilling operations, inviting a close monitoring by nearby US Navy warships. Following this brief standoff, the US Navy\u2019s littoral combat ships intermittently made themselves seen by Chinese surveillance vessels. The Navy has thus made its presence seen and felt for all sides. Whether these examples have provided a precedence for the future US Navy missions and involvement in disputes remains to be seen. Legitimacy and Credibility It goes without saying that while stronger US support for weaker states\u2019 maritime rights is welcomed, it also raises tension in the region. With the stronger, more muscular US Navy presence comes more frequent encounters with Chinese counterparts and, therefore, grown risk of accidents and escalation. Washington must therefore ensure that its actions, while deliberate, are both credible, controlled and legitimate, and avoid entangling smaller states between the two behemoths navies. Ideally, US presence comes in frequent coordination with allies and partners, giving any action it takes broader legitimacy. Ultimately, legitimacy is the most critical enabler for any US action in the South China Sea and how those actions will be received and perceived by others. It is, nevertheless, a good start that the US is voicing support for the 36th ASEAN Summit chairman\u2019s statement and backing allies and partners \u0336  such as Japan, Australia, India \u0336 in unilateral as well as joint statements that call out Chinese coercive actions. It is also helpful that Washington is insisting on the primacy of international rules and norms over \u201cmight makes right\u201d. Probably not in too distant future, we will see whether Washington will be willing to follow through with this bold policy statement."

    "title": "End of Al Qaeda Era?",
    "author(s)": "By Raffaello Pantucci",
    "date": "No. 207 \u2013 3 December 2020",
    "content": "THE REPORTED deaths of Ayman al Zawahiri and a number of other senior Al Qaeda figures suggests we are approaching the end of an era. At the same time, a series of events in Europe point to a terror threat that remains as ingrained and dangerous as ever. None of this is about the persistence of Al Qaeda and ISIS-affiliated groups around the world. These parallel sets of events illustrate the reality that terrorist groups are not the ultimate problem in themselves, but are an articulation of broader societal issues. The core group may be withering, but the problems driving their emergence remain. Other Fires Burn, Different Set of Problems Much like their initial emergence, Al Qaeda\u2019s senior leadership\u2019s slow disintegration has been shrouded in mystery. The deaths of Abu Muhsin al-Masri (Husam Abd-al- Rauf) in Afghanistan, Abu Muhammad al-Masri (Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah) in Tehran and the possible passing of leader Ayman al Zawahiri have all taken place off stage. Some, like Abu Muhammad\u2019s dramatic shooting in Tehran, seem cinematic in their drama. Others, like Ayman al Zawahiri\u2019s possible passing, suggest a quiet exit. But this series of deaths leaves very few men standing amongst the initial cohort who assembled around Osama bin Laden as he launched his jihad against the West. Yet as this light dims, other fires burn. Around the world, Al Qaeda or ISIS-affiliated or -inspired groups continue to operate; but they now have turned inwards on their local contexts, focused on whichever regional struggle they have emerged from. Global goals now seem secondary priorities. And in the West a very different threat troubles security forces. The spate of attacks and plots that Europe has seen over the past few months illustrate a different set of problems. Not the large-scale terrorist attacks of 2001, but rather a constant patter of rage articulated through pin-prick attacks. And there is no connection to Al Qaeda in any of these attacks. Some jihadi strategists would argue that this is the fulfilment of the vision laid out by one of their visionaries, Abu Musab al Suri, who wrote at length of a global insurgency made up of attacks and cells with no direct link to each other but all driven by the same aim and goal. Yet the seeming incoherence of the attacks and their planning suggest otherwise. Few of the attackers seem driven by genuine belief, more often are stirred by personal or confused rage which they have attached to a jihadi ideology. None show a tangible link to the initial core of Al Qaeda, and in many cases, show little link to some of the group\u2019s many subsequent expressions. Al Qaeda\u2019s heir ISIS seems to be the most effective at connecting and inspiring this new generation, but there is very little evidence usually of cases having specific direction and planning organised by the group. The Disentangling of Two Threads The most recent European case, carried out by a woman who started stabbing at passersby at a shopping mall in Lugano, Switzerland, appears to be have been done by someone who wanted to connect with ISIS but failed to. She tried to go to Syria in 2017 and failed. The earlier attacks this year in Europe appear equally uncoordinated \u2013 some (like in Austria) show links to networks around ISIS, while others (like the young man who decapitated a teacher in Paris suburbs) show no clear links to groups, but a deep personal rage that was seeking an outlet. But it is unclear that ISIS directed any of them. Rather than seeing the realisation of a plan set in motion by Al Qaeda, we are seeing the disentangling of two threads. On the one side, an organisation that launched a war is being eradicated, while on the other a series of tensions in Europe (and elsewhere) are articulating themselves through a terminology articulated by the group. The many expressions of Al Qaeda will not go away, but the core organisation is no longer able to project its power and force in the same way. A continuing disintegration will take place as the various groups using the name around the world continue to focus their attention on local conflicts rather than the global clash the core group was advancing. Their language will remain the same to give them gravitas, but their interests will likely stay local. Deeper Issues Must Be Addressed ISIS and Al Qaeda successors and affiliates will continue to want to strike at the West, but are unlikely to dedicate too much resource towards realising these goals. Years of successful security force penetration and management have likely dampened their enthusiasm, though they will continue to look for opportunistic moments and individuals to take advantage of. At the same time, the divisions and cultural clashes in Europe and elsewhere will remain and likely worsen. A rising extreme right in Western societies reflects how anger at difference in society in the West in particular is deepening. The repeated attacks by militant Islamists we have seen in Europe show that a deep anger amongst Europe\u2019s Muslim community persists. The targets they chose are ones which reflect a desire to strike society in its every form. The manner of attack they choose is clearly inspired by Al Qaeda or ISIS, but there is very little evidence of a direct link. Nevertheless, these attacks will stir the extreme right further, exacerbating circular tensions and deepening divisions. The passing of an earlier generation of jihadists is not the end of the problem. It is the end of an expression of a problem. The deeper issues which Al Qaeda and other jihadist groups fed off in the first place to grow remain. And until these are addressed, the world is likely going to continue to see a steady patter of incidents. The difficulty will come in ensuring we are focused on managing the right expressions of the problem, and not making these tensions worse."

    "title": "\u201cOffensive Cyber\u201d and Espionage: Dirty Secrets No One Talks About",
    "author(s)": "By Shashi Jayakumar",
    "date": "No. 001 \u2013 4 January 2021",
    "content": "RECENT REVELATIONS concerning the compromise of SolarWinds' Orion network management platform through the backdoor insertion of malicious code are noteworthy in part because of the soul-searching that followed within the US political and security commentary. Many US government agencies were amongst its victims. The reactions stem from three factors. The first is sheer embarrassment. The hacking appears to have been done by the SVR \u2013 the Russian foreign intelligence service. Its exposure is at a sensitive moment in US history \u2013 and with Russia in the security crosshairs due to earlier episodes such as electoral interference. Secondly, this was not a run-of-the -mill exploit. This was a sophisticated \u201csupply chain\u201d attack aimed compromising a trusted tool which downstream clients would assume is safe. Distractions on Two Fronts? The third factor is a conceptual one, and has to do with the mistaken notion that what happened amounted to OPE (operational preparation of the environment), or preparation for destructive attacks. The separating line between OPE and intelligence collection in the domain cyber can be fluid; there is little evidence too that there was an attempt to convert this espionage operation into evidence of a destructive attack. The somewhat bellicose talk of kinetic retaliation has proved something of a distraction from two issues. The first is a perceptual one. From the point of view of US\u2019 adversaries \u2013 and even some allies \u2013 the US has been engaged in the same game for some considerable amount of time. The Snowden revelations have shown this, and there has also been more recently some light thrown on spying through technical means, sometimes in concert with select trusted partners, against other nations (including friendly ones), in the form of the Crypto AG scandal. The second distraction may be one with internal ramifications. What should not be forgotten from the Solarwinds episode is where the real remediation efforts lie. There should be a comprehensive breach notification law (which currently is only addressed at the state level) for the private sector in the US. And crucially, the incoming Biden administration needs to initiate a comprehensive cross-governmental effort (including the Department of Defence vendors, and the Department of Homeland Security) to address software and hardware vulnerability from vendors. These things are difficult to do, but necessary, and may in fact be the real learning lessons that should be heeded. Retaliation and Deterrence The US has the tools in its cyber arsenal to retaliate as well as the doctrinal blueprint to do so, having evolved offensive doctrine that provides a conceptual and operational framework to respond to cyberattacks. The culmination of this thinking came in the form of two seminal documents in 2018: The first is the White House\u2019s National Cyber Strategy (NCS) which warns of developing \u201cswift and transparent consequences\u201d \u201cto deter future bad behaviour\u201d; the second is the DoD\u2019s own Cyber Strategy which makes pointed mention of the concept \u201cdefending forward\u201d, or halting malicious cyber activity at its source, which includes, it must be presumed, extraterritorial cyber operations. Imposing costs on the adversary, and resetting adversary expectations in cyberspace, have therefore now become essential parts of US offensive cyber doctrine. Core to this even in times of peace is activity in adversary networks. But activity and interdiction also take place in \u201cgrey zones\u201d (as defined by the US), which might be networks of neutral states or even states allied with the party initiating action. This is a grey area in international law, with very little discussion on what happens when states seek to transit through nodes located elsewhere, or interdict others, when the adversary in question is another state. Solarwinds, Supply Chain Compromise & No Red Lines? A supply chain compromise is one matter. But nations engaging in persistent forward defence \u2013 and here one must assume that several nations think similar as the US \u2500 may choose to up the ante especially if engaging in retaliatory action. They might for example put in place assets that could compromise or even cause damage to critical infrastructure. The line between reconnoitering and the emplacing of these assets (as a preparatory to a cyber attack), is recognised to be grey area by many experts; and for some nations, this may cross the \u201cuse of force threshold\u201d justifying an armed response, although there is no international consensus on this. There is, in short, the risk of miscalculation in a realm where there is no accepted codification of red lines. As some respected commentators have observed, it is unclear what aspect of international law would have been contravened by the Solarwinds espionage incident. The norms agreed at the 2015 UN GGE (Group of Governmental Experts) also do not cover espionage activities. Officials from major cyber powers have spoken generally about international law in cyberspace but have not been precise when it comes to how international law interacts with their right to defend themselves. This criticism is not specific to the US: other major cyber powers, while agreeing in general terms that international law applies in cyberspace, are chary of contributing to discussions on enforcement mechanisms. Norms do matter but not that much. The discussions themselves must and will of course continue, but it is extremely unlikely that as it stands they will prevent cycles of escalatory retaliation \u2500 or espionage when it serves the interest of the state. This is illustrated in the willingness of states (or hackers working at the behest of a state) to attempt cyber-enabled espionage to discern the extent of the COVID outbreak in other countries and the actions being taken against the virus. Southeast Asia: Friends in Need? Cyber discourse is not as well developed in Southeast Asia as it is in the West. Nations in the region have shown signs of participating more actively in discussions on advancing responsible state behaviour on cyberspace. But when it comes to thorny issues such as attribution of cyberattacks, and taking a stance on whether hostile cyber operations that are not physically destructive (but might affect critical infrastructure, or even undermine governments) can constitute a use of force, no firm positions are taken. Singapore and Southeast Asian nations should prepare for scenarios that might see intensified conflict within the cyber arena by the major powers -- conflict that might test existing, ambiguous, positions. Nations may come under pressure, for example, to attribute cyberattacks. Singapore has suffered major hacks before \u2013 with the most serious, the IHiS/SingHealth breach, almost certainly the work of state-linked actors, although following the usual practice, no specific official attribution was made. Separately, APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) groups thought to emanate from the region have targeted Singapore-based firms, a case in point being APT 32, or Ocean Lotus. The identification of APT32 with Vietnam has recently been confirmed by Facebook in its own investigations. Besides calling out aggressors (or being pressured to do so), another possible scenario might see countries in the region facing situations where major powers seek grey zone cooperation on the denial of space for others to operate, perhaps in the context of an offensive cyber campaign. These would be difficult situations to be placed in, and they may, or may not, transpire. They may in fact already be happening. Their very possibility refreshes the seemingly tired adage that there are no permanent friends in statecraft. Especially not in cyber."

    "title": "Biden\u2019s Foreign Policy: Reading the Tea Leaves",
    "author(s)": "By Adam Garfinkle",
    "date": "No. 072 \u2013 30 April 2021",
    "content": "BUSINESS IS always brisk in the tea-leaf reading industry at the start of a new US administration. As the Biden administration approaches its first hundred days in office on 30 April 2021, the ASEAN world is abuzz with analysis and prediction, and the usual ensemble of premonition and hope. Among the questions posed as torque points for inquiry is this: What to make of the 3 March White House-issued Interim National Security Strategy Guidance (INSSG)? What does it mean for Singapore and Southeast Asia? The INSSG The INSSG is the most significant and lavishly verbal of the Biden administration\u2019s early signals. It\u2019s also unique in being the first time since Congress mandated the Strategic Guidance obligation on the Executive Branch in the hallmark 1986 Goldwater-Nichols legislation that a new administration promulgated an interim assessment, and so quickly. Why did the Biden White House do it? Three reasons converge to explain it. First, while it remains to be seen if the new administration has actually worked out substantive policy choices, it does show every sign of having a communications strategy whose principal audience is domestic more than foreign. This is not incidental, for it sees domestic political equities as being at the very core of US foreign and national security policy. Why? Administration principals believe that if the Republican Party in its current state of manic xenophobia, and with its anti-democratic, conspiracy-addled siege mentality, should reclaim control of the Congress in 2022 and the White House in 2024, the very basis of US foreign policy would likely disintegrate. This entails its liberal positive-sum principles, its alliances and institutions, and the substrate of domestic political support for an active, constructive US global role. They are not mistaken, which helps explain the INSSG\u2019s simplistic Manichean democracy-versus-authoritarianism organising template, one that reminds us more of the Truman Doctrine than anything else. This choice speaks to a domestic audience, the bet here being that cold-hearted Trumpian transactionalism in international affairs appeals not to the American soul. Non-Traditional Dimensions of National Security Policy Second and accordingly, the INSSG deviates from the by-now standard Democratic narrative about \u201cnon-traditional\u201d dimensions of national security policy in three key ways, all attuned to domestic politics. It doubles down on the national security impact of \u201cclimate change\u201d, which amounts to a secular religious calling whatever its actual scientific basis; it expresses a preference for selected protectionism to align trade policy with the needs of the American middle class; and, relatedly, it sharply prioritises both the domestic bases and impact of foreign and national security policies over traditional perspectives. In sum, the United States used to have \u201cforeign and national security policies\u201d seen as more separate than not from its domestic policies and politics; now it has for all practical purposes domestic policies (and politics) with foreign/national security aspects. Third, the White House appears to have wanted to quickly dispel concern that it lacked bandwidth for foreign policy given such a full and portentous domestic agenda, and that it could not see beyond the contours of restoring what foreign policies existed on 19 January 2017, the last full day of the Obama administration. The truth is that these constraints are real. A President \u201cAll In\u201d That said, it was wise to try to manage impressions with the INSSG, and it was done with shrewdness aforethought. Whatever material NSC Advisor Jake Sullivan pulled off the shelf for quick editing, President Biden himself is understood to have put his own hand on the document. That matters; it means that, whatever the policies may be, the president is \u201call in\u201d with them, and not randomly at odds with his own advisers as Trump was for four years of mayhem and ceaseless uncertainly. It is a statement about the relationship between sound process and coherent outcomes, and it is a statement well worth having made. Having a communications strategy is important, and a proffered US$715 billion defence budget is a signal at least as powerful, if cruder, as the INSSG. But in the end substance matters more than symbols. Here the picture so far is mixed. Despite much talk about democracy and human rights, the actual complexity of applying aspirational idealism has come clear in early dealings with Saudi Arabia. The early speeches and the INSSG have not made it any easier to deal with Afghanistan, or to restore some version of the JCPOA with Iran, or to parry increasingly bold Chinese tests over Taiwan and Russian tests in Ukraine, or to work out effective and practical policies over Myanmar or North Korea. They have not made it any easier to decide how to parry Iranian proxy threats whose territorial ground-zero includes both Iraq and Syria. And that\u2019s the short list of pressing issues the president does not have enough time for. Southeast Asia? The 23 pages of the INSSG mention Singapore and Southeast Asia once, after Europe, the Western Hemisphere, Israel and the Middle East, Australia, India and New Zealand, and just before the Pacific Island nations: \u201cWe will deepen our partnership with India and work alongside New Zealand, as well as Singapore, Vietnam, and other Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states, to advance shared objectives.\u201d Could have been worse: Africa is not mentioned at all. But not much worse if you are trying to read real priorities into a text like the INSSG. You should not be doing that, however. Many readers in foreign governments and media establishments tend to treat documents like the INSSG as scriptural, as containing gnostic wisdom to be found by careful exegesis of subtle hints. The INSSG expresses important nuances even though its actual signals do not reside within the four corners of the document but outside them. But a new administration still staffing up and yet to deal with a major foreign crisis does not even know what it thinks about most things to a level of specificity that actually matters. Biden & the Indo-Pacific In general, while the Indo-Pacific will concern the Biden administration a great deal, if only because of the presumed centrality of China as singular challenger to US preeminence, it will depend on the Quad quasi-alliance and, within the Quad more on its relationship with Japan, to help manage the challenge. That was the signal from the first-ever, if virtual, Quad summit on 12 March. Southeast Asian countries are liable to be seen mainly as stakes in the competition and puzzle pieces to be assembled tactically to add to the larger picture, not as co-equal diplomatic partners. It is useful to think of a new US administration in foreign policy as a brain full of dendrites waiting to be shaped into neural pathways by contact with reality. The brain, connected obviously to the body politic, owes much to inheritance, and reality does not typically jump out of its own skin. But there is still plenty of variation to make predictions about how that brain will work risky exercises in tea-leaf reading. Best to enjoy the tea, and leverage its stimulating qualities for purposes of careful observation."

    "title": "Name-Giving in Muslim Mindanao: Problem of Conflating Labels",
    "author(s)": "By Mathew L. Bukit",
    "date": "No. 034 \u2013 23 February 2021",
    "content": "MURAD EBRAHIM, Chairman of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and Interim Chief Minister of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), recently announced that he had reached out to three Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighter (BIFF) and Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) factions affiliated with the \u2018Islamic State\u2019 (IS), seeking to \u201cconvince them to join\u2026the government\u201d. The fact that two out of three factions are reportedly receptive to this overture brings into question whether the demarcation between the \u2018revolutionary\u2019 MILF and the \u2018terroristic\u2019 ASG and BIFF is as clear-cut as their labels suggest. Rather, the in (un)surprising counterterrorism can inadvertently lead to parochialism. rapprochement highlights how name-giving inkling of What is \u2018Terrorism\u2019? Since 9/11, terrorism has been a permanent fixture in global security discourse. As attention ballooned, the descriptive value of \u2018terrorism\u2019 has been eroded by a nexus of policy and media name-giving, while also being applied to an increasingly broad range of acts and actors. The term is so contested that no universally agreed upon definition of terrorism exists. Tenuous militant identities are negotiated against the backdrop of the aphorism \u201cone man\u2019s terrorist is another\u2019s freedom fighter\u201d. For example, in 2003 the Philippines government attempted to come to terms with whether the MILF were \u2018revolutionaries\u2019 or \u2018terrorists\u2019. Though they ultimately opted to retain the \u2018revolutionary\u2019 label, it was not without public deliberation that demonstrated the arbitrariness of these labels. The tendency to demarcate what are considered discrete types of violence for which coherent strategies can be tailored is made problematic by this arbitrariness and definitional quibbling. The mixing and matching of deradicalisation, counter-narratives, community engagement, development, political reform, policing, and military operations or preventing/countering violent extremism. These approaches propagate a presumed distinctiveness between the threats posed by terrorists, insurgents, and violent extremists. counterinsurgency, counterterrorism, manifests as But violence rarely conforms to neat categories, especially when the character of a conflict is changing. In such cases, uncertain deferral to the categories and labels that should aid the formulation of, rather than dictate, responses can risk misdiagnosing its perpetrators by putting the cart before the horse. The perceived shift from Moro (Philippine Muslim) separatism to IS terrorism in the southern Philippines typifies this transforming threat landscape. Moro Separatism Moro separatists fought an insurgency in Mindanao from the early 1970s in pursuit of a Muslim nation in the Philippines: the Bangsamoro. The most prominent armed groups were the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and MILF \u2018revolutionary\u2019 groups, and ASG and BIFF \u2018terrorist\u2019 groups. Both revolutionary groups have signed peace agreements with the Philippines government, resulting in iterations of autonomous regional governance: first the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, which was replaced by the MILF-led BARMM in 2019. As the insurgency putatively wound down with the 2012 Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro, which paved the way for the BARMM, the rise of IS and its quest for a global caliphate eclipsed Moro irredentism in policy thinking. A constellation of militants in Mindanao began to swear fealty to IS in 2014; first ASG faction leader Isnilon Hapilon, with the BIFF and Ansar al-Khilafah Philippines shortly thereafter. The Maute Group, who swore allegiance to IS in 2016, would gain infamy for their major role in the 2017 Battle of Marawi. The scale of the five-month long Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) siege against IS-affiliated Filipino and foreign fighters came as a shock to those that had downplayed IS\u2019 presence in the Philippines. Bringing the Local Back In Since then, and amidst a growing trend of suicide bombings, IS terrorism is now considered dominant, with the Bangsamoro struggle seemingly consigned to history. The BIFF are caught in the turning tide, once nominally separatists pursuing the Bangsamoro, but now perceived to be adrift between this goal and IS ideology. In 2017, the AFP believed that the BIFF was \u201ctraining for its gradual alignment with DAESH ideology and objectives\u201d, referring to another name for IS. Yet, there is an implicit recognition of instrumentality in believing that violent irredentism and global jihad might be reconciled through training. When IS ideology predominates the characterisation of militants, idiosyncrasies below the surface of their aggregation are obscured. Violence is equally shaped from the bottom-up by local interests as it is from the top- down by what is conceived to be a conflict\u2019s overarching issue. Overlaying understandings of IS over militants in the Philippines should converge with, not substitute, situating them in their local context. Since its founding in 2010, the BIFF consistently engaged in clan feuding known as rido, which ranges from land disputes to electoral violence. Electoral conflict is endemic in the Philippines but particularly pronounced in Mindanao as a legacy of its dysfunctional incorporation into the state. In Mindanao, clans wield violence to monopolise political offices and protect their participation in lucrative illicit economies. This has at times been tolerated in Manila because Muslim politicians have historically delivered bloc voting that can win national elections. Following the 2015 death of its founder Ameril Umra Kato, the BIFF split into three factions, of which two are pro-IS and the most fervent led by Abu Toraife. Even so, the behaviour of Toraife\u2019s followship has not deviated too far from the BIFF\u2019s pre-splinter conduct, continuing to challenge the oligarchic monopoly over local illicit economies by extorting local governments and mulcting \u2018revolutionary taxes.\u2019 Finding a Middle Ground The significance of IS in Mindanao should nevertheless not be downplayed. The enlistment of foreign fighters is clearly important, most visibly in the continued spectre of suicide bombings. However, this generally remains insulated from \u2014 rather than transforms \u2014 the relationship between Filipino militants and their local milieu. Nor are espousals of IS ideology unequivocally instrumental. Though most IS-affiliated Filipino militants are unlikely to understand the Salafi-jihadist principles underpinning IS ideology, the depositions of suspects in the Maute Group\u2019s 2016 Davao City Bombing indicated the allure of IS\u2019 narrative of \u2018purely Islamic\u2019 governance. But it is difficult to divorce that narrative from its juxtaposition with Mindanao\u2019s local milieu today, where political clans have long defended their hegemony and illicit aggrandisement to the national government by instrumentalising Muslim Filipino identity. What is key for those in authority who allocate descriptive labels is regular introspection to ensure that labels continue to clarify, rather than conflate, the pathologies of violence in Muslim Mindanao."

Since 2018, the EDA has established a common AI taxonomy and glossary and developed an action plan on AI. The aim is to foster a greater number of collaborative AI projects, enhance cooperation with industry and support AI projects funded by Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and the European Defence Fund (EDF). The European Commission\u2019s (EC) own strategy to facilitate AI adoption is evolving, which affects European efforts towards military AI. Under the Action Plan on synergies between civil, defence and space industries, the EU will develop specific civil-defence technology roadmaps and standards, establish innovation incubators and cross- border defence innovation networks, and provide new forms of funding for European AI development. While European AI governance is developing, key technical and political challenges to faster European adoption of AI persist. They include the increase in European production of high-performance, the establishment a single EU data space, which could be the first step towards greater military data shareability to fuel faster military AI adoption. low-energy computer processors and AI: Europe\u2019s Game-Changer or Gradual Change? AI is expected to be a game-changer in European security and defence. It will be a key part of future European weapon systems, such as the Europe\u2019s future sixth- generation fighter and next-generation main battle tank. Nevertheless, the European approach to AI-enabled capability development and operational capacity has been incremental. Europeans tend to use AI technologies to gradually optimise and improve capabilities, plug capability gaps and increase operational capacity in national and EU-funded projects. Examples of scalable projects that include AI are project SCORPION, which develops a new motorised capability for the French land forces, and the German-Dutch project TEN which develops reliable tactical edge communication networks for land forces. However, these are upgraded iterations of programmes that have been in place for a decade or longer. In 2019, the EU developed a concept for the digitalisation of defence which sees AI as an enabler for plugging capability shortfalls that relate to achieving information dominance. Its focus seems to be on available and interoperable AI-augmented conventional capabilities and less on new operational concepts for their deployment. This incremental approach is inconsistent with the European level of ambition of global leadership in emerging technologies and, if it is maintained, it could undermine the Union\u2019s goals of strategic autonomy and technological sovereignty. Course Correction in European AI Adoption The EU is a collection of 27 states with varying degrees of technical capacity and AI ecosystems in place. Only one (France) in 26 EU member states has a dedicated AI strategy for defence. The majority of the remaining 26 EU member states vary in the incorporation of defence use cases in their national AI strategies, defence planning and AI R&D/T funding. This raises the risk of emerging intra-European AI capability gaps and lower interoperability. Ongoing AI national projects in Europe may result in non-interoperable AI-enabled capabilities and risk perpetuating structural vulnerabilities in the European defence sector and the European defence industry, which make Europe less globally competitive. To overcome European fragmentation of military AI adoption along national lines, member states need to urgently incorporate the strategic and full-spectrum European capabilities landscape into their defence planning and cooperation. However, the 2020 Coordinated Annual Review on Defence confirmed there is little room for course correction in the short-term. The aim is to move towards greater European defence cooperation in the mid-term (mid-2020s). So far, progress on greater European defence cooperation in AI has been very slow. 2019 has seen the lowest record of collaborative R&T funding in Europe (at roughly 31% of 2007 levels), although defence procurement is increasing. This suggests that despite the goal of supporting greater European technological sovereignty and despite greater European defence spending, Europeans buy more military equipment and technologies off-the-shelf than they are willing to jointly develop in Europe. Techno-Diplomacy and EU Partnerships The EU and NATO can be institutional accelerators of European AI adoption in defence and can leverage multilateral engagements and partnerships for more effective AI governance. EU-NATO cooperation on AI has been slow, despite overlapping interests. Since 2018, the two organisations have had only two exchanges on the development of their respective AI strategies and institutional over- compartmentalisation has often obstructed deeper cooperation. Despite this, the Biden administration creates new opportunities for greater, faster and more ambitious transatlantic cooperation on military AI. And the EU\u2019s evolving approach transatlantic partnership. techno-diplomacy recognises the centrality of the to To take advantage of the new political and technological landscape, Brussels needs a new, more strategic approach to technological diplomacy that links its domestic AI policies to its outward-looking multilateral engagements. This includes areas that impact security and defence, such as computer processors and critical digital infrastructure of 5G, data and cloud. A new approach to techno-diplomacy should enable the Union to take a prominent global role on human-centric AI governance, particularly on the ethical and legal aspects of AI military use. It should also enable the EU to achieve synergies between its regional and sectoral strategies, such as the EU\u2019s connectivity strategy, its emerging Indo-Pacific strategy and its efforts in partner capacity building. A variety of instruments are being explored by EU institutions in this area, including international digital partnerships and digital coalitions of the willing with like-minded countries for cooperation on AI. However, the EU needs to channel its efforts into developing a clear technological offer and a coherent political messaging on AI towards its partners."

    "title": "Women, Peace and Security in ASEAN: New Issues",
    "author(s)": "By Noeleen Heyzer",
    "date": "No. 204 \u2013 27 November 2020",
    "content": "WITH TWO ASEAN members, Vietnam and Indonesia in the United Nations Security Council, the region has advanced the UN Security Council Resolution (SCR) 1325 on Women, Peace and Security. This is the first global framework that addresses the changing nature of conflicts, the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war, the issues of exclusion and injustice, and the importance of women\u2019s participation in peace and development. As the 2020 ASEAN Chair, Vietnam has focused on enhancing the leadership and roles of ASEAN women in sustainable peace, security and development, while Indonesia has championed women in peacekeeping as president of the Security Council in August 2020. 2020 is a pivotal year to revitalise commitment to achieve gender equality and empowerment for women everywhere. It marks the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations and the UN Charter whose preamble ensures \u201cthe equal rights of men and women \u2026 to better standards of life in larger freedom\u201d. It is also the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women, and the 20th anniversary of the landmark SCR 1325 on Women, Peace and Security. Over the past two decades, the international community has increasingly recognised that women\u2019s meaningful participation in peace and security matters are important not only to ensure respect for women\u2019s human rights, but also fundamental to build a solid foundation for sustainable peace and just societies, to prevent the conflicts of tomorrow. ASEAN\u2019s Commitment to UN SCR 1325 In Southeast Asia, ASEAN leaders issued a Joint Statement on Promoting Women, Peace and Security at the 31st ASEAN Summit in the Philippines, highlighting ASEAN\u2019s commitment to the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda. Much has been done to support WPS since that important decision in 2017, and to work closely with the UN in its implementation under the ASEAN-UN Comprehensive Partnership. ASEAN and the UN co-organised the first dedicated Track 1.5 regional dialogue on Women, Peace and Security and women\u2019s role in the prevention of violent extremism in 2017, bringing together ASEAN governments and committed women\u2019s civil society organisations. In December 2018 ASEAN launched its Women\u2019s Peace Registry and organised the first ASEAN Symposium on Women, Peace and Security in August 2019. The ASEAN panel \u201cThe Role of Women Mediators in the Maintenance of Regional Peace and Security\u201d took place in July 2020 with the new initiative to set up a \u2018Southeast Asia Network of Women Peace Mediators\u2019, with strong support of Indonesia. The ASEAN Ministerial Dialogue on Strengthening Women\u2019s Role for Sustainable Peace and Security was convened by Vietnam as Chair of ASEAN in September 2020 resulting in the Joint Communique by the foreign ministers. ASEAN has provided strong contribution to UN peacekeeping with around 5,000 UN military and UN Police deployed in 10 global UN peace operations. The recent Security Council Resolution on Women and Peacekeeping Operations during Indonesia\u2019s presidency of the Security Council will increase the numbers of women as peacekeepers. Much has been done, yet so much remains to be done because of the changing peace and security landscape. New Issues Four new issues need to be highlighted to effectively implement the WPS agenda in ASEAN. #1 COVID-19 More Than a Health Pandemic: The COVID-19 pandemic is more than a health crisis; it is an economic crisis, a humanitarian crisis, a security crisis, and a human rights crisis. It has not stopped conflicts and displacement but has created immense constraints to sustaining peace, to human rights, to human development and to addressing planet security. The security-sustainable development nexus and opportunities for regional cooperation are critical for response and recovery. Our concept of security will need to include health security, climate security, addressing inequalities, upholding human rights and good governance, understanding the linkages between peace, sustainable development, and humanitarian action. Women are already at the frontlines, responding to the needs of those affected by the health pandemic, by conflict and disasters. They are even more crucial now to prevent the further fracturing of society, to build foundations for restoring confidence and sustaining peace as we remake our societies to protect and deliver on critical public goods. #2 Global Ceasefire and Conflict Prevention: The UN Secretary-General\u2019s call for a global ceasefire has been widely endorsed by ASEAN foreign ministers, and recently by all ASEAN leaders at the 11th ASEAN-UN Summit on 15 November. Together with the ceasefire, the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has placed conflict prevention at the top of his agenda, stressing the need to invest in the infrastructure of peace and security: the values and institutions that sustain peace. ASEAN countries have been successful at sustaining peace regionally. But several are affected by subnational conflicts and inter-communal tensions. This is the time to urgently promote social cohesion, to build trust with local communities and invest in community-led resilience and response systems. There are already examples of how women in the police force and as peacekeepers have built confidence among local communities. The newly established ASEAN Network of Women Mediators would be an important addition to this effort. #3 Cyber Security, Misinformation and Hate Speech: In the age of social media, the misinformation, hate speech and narratives in the public arena can hamper tackling the root causes of conflicts and forging political solutions to grievances. Given these and other challenges, we need to be better at converting early warning into early action, using all tools, including mediation to respond to early signs of tensions and conflicts flaring up, to fight discrimination and xenophobia intensified by the pandemic, to promote reconciliation and healing. This is the time to urgently focus on cybersecurity, digital literacy and on bridging the digital divide affecting women. #4 People on the Move & Violence Against Women: The impact of COVID-19 is especially hard for millions of people on the move, such as low-waged migrants, victims of trafficking, refugees and internally displaced persons fleeing persecution. The tightening of border controls complicates their access to protection with hundreds of refugees stranded at sea in the ASEAN region. Many refugees are women, and girls are forced into child marriage because of the unbearable situation they find themselves in. The rise of extremism has further led to the closing of spaces for women and to an increase in violence against women. The Secretary General has issued a global call emphasising the need for an end to all violence against women not just in conflict situations but everywhere, including in the home, especially during this pandemic when people are locked in. These are all issues that the women, peace and security agenda will need to address in the changing peace, security and development landscape. ASEAN-UN Partnership: Mainstreaming Gender ASEAN is committed to building a people-centred community, promoting the complementarities between the ASEAN Community Vision 2025 and the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, moving forward with the WPS agenda, and the ASEAN Comprehensive Covid-19 Recovery Framework. This is an opportunity to mainstream gender in all areas of cooperation under the ASEAN-UN Plan of Action, to leverage the full, equal and meaningful leadership and participation of women \u2013 from political decision-making to peacebuilding and pandemic response. Moving the women, peace and security agenda forward offers an important pathway to ASEAN\u2019s transformative recovery and journey towards sustaining peace and a secure future of shared prosperity."

    "title": "US Assassination of Gen Qassem Soleimani & Its Aftermath Iranian General\u2019s Killing: How Will Iran Respond?",
    "author(s)": "By Ahmed S. Hashim",
    "date": "No. 005 \u2013 7 January 2020",
    "content": "AYATOLLAH KHAMENEI, the supreme leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, once referred to General Qassem Soleimani as a \u2018living martyr of the revolution\u2019. Assassinated on 3 January 2020 by US drones in Iraq, Soleimani was a legend in Iran. His was such a big name at home that some equate his assassination, on the orders of President Trump, as the killing of Iran\u2019s de facto vice-president. It would thus be virtually impossible for Iran not to respond, but how will Tehran do so? From \u2018Living Martyr\u2019 to Martyr Soleimani was born in southern Kerman province in Iran. He left home at 12 years of age to work as a labourer. When war broke out with Iraq in 1980, Soleimani volunteered and headed to the frontline to fight, eventually becoming a senior commander in the 48th Division of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). After rising through the ranks of the Iranian military, Soleimani was appointed commander of the Quds Force in 1997, which is responsible for the political warfare and sub-conventional operations of the IRGC. Soleimani\u2019s threat perceptions were shaped by the Iran-Iraq war, by the massive presence of US forces in the region, and by the rise of anti-Shia extremist groups, which Soleimani referred to as \u2018Takfirism\u2019. These factors shaped his use of sub- conventional warfare capabilities. Soleimani was not merely a military commander and tactician. He had developed skills as a diplomatic negotiator and masterful promoter of Iran\u2019s national security interests in the region. The justification for killing Soleimani was that he was involved in the \u201cIranian-backed\u201d militias assault on US interests in Iraq and the attack on the US embassy in Baghdad. While that provided a justification for the Trump administration, there was no evidence that Soleimani was involved in this. When he was killed, his primary concern was what seemed to be an erosion of the Iranian position in Iraq as a result of the instability in that country, as reflected in the emergence of protests against government incompetence and undue Iranian influence. The Trump administration also claimed that it killed him and his associates because they were planning a series of \u2018sinister\u2019 military operations against US interests. Officials such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed the US had the intelligence on this, which he, of course, demurred from releasing, though he said the administration would do so in due course. US Blundering After the Killing Anonymous Pentagon officials contradicted this when they claimed that there was no indication of immediate plans of Iranian escalation in Iraq. Following the killing of Soleimani, worried US officials from Trump down fell over themselves with justifications and rationalisations: It was claimed that Soleimani was a \u2018bad man\u2019 who had killed tens of thousands of people in Iran, Syria, Yemen, and Iraq. Soleimani was killed not because he was a 'bad man'; he definitely would not have been killed if he had been America\u2019s \u2018bad man\u2019. The US was not concerned with the deaths of tens of thousands of \u2018locals\u2019 at the hands of Soleimani and his allies. The US did not kill him because he had ostensibly played a role in the killing of the US contractor in Kirkuk or in the assault on the US embassy in Baghdad. To be sure, Trump may have been worried about US diplomats being taken hostage in a replay of the Benghazi siege or even worse, the US embassy hostage drama in Tehran decades ago. He may have even been trying to deflect from his growing domestic problems associated with impeachment. Soleimani was killed because he and his vast network of militias and skills in sub- conventional warfare were a threat to US interests in the region, and to Israel, which had advocated his assassination previously and to the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. Taking him out would deprive Iran of a seasoned commander in case of further escalation of the Iranian-Israeli \u2018undeclared war\u2019 in Syria or a full-scale US-Iran war. Soleimani has had a bullseye on him long before recent events. It is not inconceivable that hawks within the administration pushed Trump into this act. Killing Soleimani was designed either to establish US dominance and force it into war with the US, or to back down in a manner that would humiliate it and delegitimise it. How Will Iran Respond? Pundits are referring to the killing as a \u2018game-changer\u2019. They are predicting that Iran must respond now and that this will lead to a bloody war. This seems like an eminently logical prediction, if not a self-fulfilling prophecy. Why is it a logical prediction? Iran has to respond to this. Its prestige and legitimacy are at stake. The US did not simply target Iranian forces on the ground as Israel had been doing in Syria. The US killed a military commander and senior official of the Iranian government. The US declaration of Soleimani as a \u2018terrorist\u2019 heading a \u2018terrorist\u2019 entity notwithstanding, simply does not make him or the Quds Force such. For Iran, this means its officials are subject to decapitation, even in the absence of war. But killing Soleimani is not prelude to war, it is an act of war. In a supreme act of Orwellian \u2018doublespeak,\u2019 both Trump and Pompeo claimed that the killing of Soleimani was designed to de-escalate the situation. Iran will simply not see it that way. A lack of response could have incalculable consequences for the regime in the region and at home: its enemies would be emboldened regionally and at home. Hence, Iran must respond. So, how will it respond? This is a significant problem. Iran cannot respond conventionally by attacking US forces in Iraq and the Persian Gulf in a war which it cannot win. Iranian doctrine calls for the avoidance of falling into the trap of conventional war against a stronger enemy. This is something that Soleimani and other Iranian military leaders have repeatedly advised against, unless forced. It could respond asymmetrically with sub-conventional war and try to engage in plausible deniability. It retains a vast capacity for sub-conventional warfare, which along with ballistic missiles constitute its major military assets. Problems in Iran\u2019s Asymmetric Response There are problems at the moment with any Iranian asymmetric counter-response. Everyone is assuming Iran will respond, even if its proxies undertake the retaliation, and the US will strike Iranian assets, even possibly within Iranian territory. While Trump may not be itching for a fight, the hawks around him are and a major Iranian asymmetric response could escalate to outright war, which would allow Trump to blame Iran. Iran\u2019s trajectory could be the incremental approach rather than the immediate response. Iran does not make hasty decisions or ones on the fly. The Iranian system debates, often extensively, to address the pros and cons of desired or necessary policy outcomes. The incremental is geared more towards political responses such as step-by-step withdrawal from the nuclear accord (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA) and helping undermine the US presence in Iraq. Iran has been known to put national interests above immediate action; indeed, it has and can defer a military or \u2018game-changing\u2019 response. It can wait until the US guard is down. Ultimately, one could say that the Iranians believe that revenge should be a dish served cold; and in this context, what if we wake up to a headline one day: Iranian scientists test two nuclear devices in the Dasht-e-Kavir desert? Now that would be both revenge and a game-changer."

    "title": "Myanmar Crisis and ASEAN: What\u2019s Really at Stake",
    "author(s)": "By Naoko Kumada",
    "date": "No. 050 \u2013 22 March 2021",
    "content": "ON 8 AUGUST 1988, I witnessed mass anti-government protests break out on the streets in Yangon. As the protests escalated in the following weeks, all foreigners were required to leave the country, except diplomats and their family members like myself. The date left a permanent mark in Myanmar society and in my consciousness. Today, Myanmar is undergoing yet another crisis. This situation is deja vu in Myanmar's post-independence history. General Ne Win overthrew U Nu\u2019s civilian government in 1962 and led the country for the next 26 years. These events reflect the difficulties of governing a complex nation whose very sovereignty remains a troubled work in progress. Issues of Sovereignty and Nationhood They result from historical issues left over from more-than-a-century of colonial capitalist exploitation followed by internal and external threats to its integrity during the Cold War. Myanmar's proud and ancient tradition of sovereignty was not simply suspended, it was wiped out entirely when the British dethroned and led its last King, Thibaw, out in humiliation on a bullock-cart in 1885. \u201cBurma'' was annexed and made a province of British India. This loss of monarchy and sovereign statehood led to a near total breakdown of Myanmar\u2019s social, religious, and political order over the following decades. Burmans, subdued by British Indian troops, were excluded from the new military and administered by transplanted Indian officers. Burmese peasants, thrown into the global capitalist economy, were dispossessed by money-lenders and displaced by farmers and indentured labour from India. Soon after Burma declared independence in 1948, its sovereignty and basis as a nation over the tangled lines of empire were fought over as mutinies and civil war broke out. From 1949, the country was invaded and partially occupied by Kuomintang (KMT) troops. In this Forgotten War they were backed by Washington as part of \u201ca grand strategy to contain the People\u2019s Republic of China [...] to utilise the remnants of Chiang\u2019s forces for the purpose of harassing and weakening the Peking government from bases wrested from the Burmese [\u2026]\u201d in the words of George McTurnan Kahin, the late renowned scholar of Southeast Asia. US arms airdropped into the region were also diverted to Shan and Karen rebels. These forces profoundly destabilised the Myanmar government and created a continuing basis for the frontline mobilisation of the Myanmar military. Myanmar\u2019s Challenges Post-Cold War Like Iraq, Libya and Syria, Myanmar continues to struggle with the aftermath of empire and the Cold War. The Tatmadaw (The Armed Forces of Myanmar), and its predecessors the Burma National Army (BNA) and the Burmese Independence Army (BIA), has played a central role in Myanmar\u2019s history, fighting British and Japanese forces to obtain independence, then rebel armies and a Cold War invasion. It sees itself as the champion and guardian of Myanmar's sovereignty and territorial integrity. It remains, for all its issues and wrongs, an indispensable institution in a country beset with armed conflict. Myanmar\u2019s highly strategic location makes it a tempting target of foreign intervention. Today\u2019s crisis is familiar because fundamental issues of sovereignty remain unresolved in a state still in the making. A solution to the current crisis must therefore respect both the democratic will of its people and the role of the military in a nation that has, since 1947, suffered the modern world\u2019s longest running civil war. Both principles are written into the 2008 Constitution, as is respect for the self- determination of Myanmar\u2019s indigenous peoples. The solution will not come from former and current imperial powers using it as a platform to showcase 'values-based diplomacy' while ignoring their complicity in the violently fractured reality of Myanmar today. Myanmar and ASEAN at the Heart of Asia ASEAN is the best partner for a political solution to Myanmar\u2019s crisis. ASEAN\u2019s commitment to \u2018respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations\u2019 and \u2018abstention from intervention or interference in the internal affairs of another country\u2019 express anti-colonial principles that are also foundational to Myanmar\u2019s political culture. Given its centrality in East Asian multilateralism, ASEAN leaders and diplomats can work with those of neighbouring countries such as China and India and key economic partners such as Korea and Japan to create a framework for reconciliation and development within a context of East Asian multilateralism. Its oft-lamented weaknesses belie its strength in positionality, equality in dignity, unique diversity of political experience and capacity for quiet diplomacy exercised in a framework of open regionalism. Myanmar did not join ASEAN until 1997, but it was ASEAN\u2019s patient engagement and respect for Myanmar\u2019s conduct of its internal affairs, rather than moralising and threats, that helped move Myanmar\u2019s military leadership towards a democratic transition that, while dependent on the charisma of Aung San Suu Kyi, and thus of Aung San himself, was also orchestrated by certain members of the military leadership. Western sanctions contributed only to the isolation and suffering of the people of Myanmar, and the habit of portraying the struggle as a Manichean contest between a sainted figure and a monolithic evil may actually have retarded the path to democratic transition from the moment in 1988 that so struck me. While each day the situation grows more dire, more tragic, ASEAN must redouble efforts to play the principal mediating role in helping envision and agree, with the military government, some path of return to civilian-led rule and development. ASEAN is at the heart of an independent, confident, and interconnected Asia to which Myanmar is joined, and for which Myanmar is itself a strategic connector, between India and China, South and East Asia, and the Indian Ocean and continental Asia. ASEAN also has the most at stake, for what is at issue in Myanmar isn\u2019t merely the integrity of this past election. It is the very viability of Myanmar as a state. If that fails, then the forces and interests unleashed, as in Iraq and Libya, threaten to spill over Myanmar\u2019s territorial borders to the entire region."

    "title": "Global Health Security: COVID-19 & Its Impacts Pandemic Tracking: The Unfortunate Use of Statistics",
    "author(s)": "By Jikon Lai",
    "date": "No. 107 \u2013 1 June 2020",
    "content": "IT IS now clich\u00e9 to suggest that COVID-19 has lifted the veil on shortcomings in almost all aspects of our various dimensions of public life. One that has not received a lot of attention however is our use of statistics. Day after day, one media report after another continues to cite statistics related to COVID-19 in ways that are problematic at best, misleading at worst. Issues with the use of these statistics in recent months fall into two main areas: the use of inappropriate indicators and the inapt use of indicators. Use of Inappropriate Indicators Almost every news report and analysis on COVID-19 cite and use the total number of cases. In the context of discussing the situation within a single country, this is understandable. The total number of cases convey information about the severity of the situation. It is also something that can be used to compare changes from one day to another. The issue arises however when this indicator \u2013 the total number of cases \u2013 is used to compare situations in different countries, something which observers do every single day. Many use the total number of cases reported to imply, infer or convey the severity of the situation in one country relative to another. For instance, it is not uncommon to read statements that are similar to the following: \u2018with X number of cases, country A is now the worst-hit country in the world\u2019. The unstated assumption or implied observation here is that country A has a higher number of cases than others. The issue with this logic lies in the use of the raw number of cases to compare different countries. For example, if China had a total of 50,000 cases and Singapore had a total of 40,000 cases, would it be correct to conclude that the situation is worse in China than it is in Singapore\u2026? With those numbers, many would probably argue that the situation is worse in Singapore than in China because China has a population that is almost 250 times larger than Singapore\u2019s. The Right Way to Use Numbers As this example suggests, when comparing the situation in different countries, the relevant indicator should be the total number of cases normalised against the respective countries\u2019 populations rather than the raw total number of cases. At the time of writing, many were looking in horror at the situation in Brazil because with over 330,000 cases, it had one of the top three highest number of cases in the world and was deemed to be the epicentre of the pandemic in Latin America. However, if we look at the number of cases normalised against the size of population, Brazil recorded approximately 1,565 cases per one million population. In contrast, Ecuador reported approximately 2,034 cases per 1 million population, Chile 3,239, and Peru 3,393. I am not suggesting that the situation in Brazil is/was not dire but it is problematic to suggest, as many observers and media reports do, that the situation in Brazil is somehow the worst in Latin America simply based on the raw total number of cases. Even on a count of the number of deaths, it is problematic to suggest that the situation was the worst in Brazil among Latin American countries. Although Brazil does have the highest total number of deaths among Latin American countries, at the time of writing both Peru and Ecuador had higher number of deaths than Brazil when those statistics were normalised against the size of their respective populations. [A related but different issue here is whether it makes analytical sense to compare two very different countries such as, for example, Singapore vs China.] Inapt Use of Indicators From numerous media reports and government statements, we know that there are a range of issues with the reported statistics on COVID-19. There are debates over what is or is not counted as a case of COVID-19 because there are different ways of detecting someone who has contracted the virus. Countries also adopt different decisions on whether to officially count deaths that are suspected, but that have not been confirmed through a test, to have been caused by COVID-19 (see for example this article by The Economist). Above and beyond definitional issues, there is also scepticism over the reliability of the measurement of cases. There have been reported shortages of, as well as faulty, test-kits. Policy-makers set different conditions under which testing is conducted, thus making tests widely available in some countries, but not others. Some governments even chose not to test! The above suggests that the reported statistics reflect different things in different countries. This in itself is not necessarily an issue. First, however a country chooses to define the statistic, and however it is measured, the statistic might still have meaning within its national context. Second, since the possibility of getting a true and accurate measure of COVID-19 is an open question, deviations from \u2018the truth\u2019 is not necessarily an issue provided that the deviation is not materially substantial and that the \u2018error\u2019 in measurement is consistently applied over time. This leads us to the following: (1) our focus should be on the trend-line and not the numerical level of the statistics being reported; and (2) numerical comparisons of the statistics reported by different countries is problematic at best. Neither of these issues is unique to COVID-19, but are instead common in the construction of most statistical measures. Caveat Emptor Numbers are seductive. People like to use it for the certainty that they seemingly offer. However, caveat emptor: While statistics on COVID-19 might offer us an insight into the disease\u2019s development over time, we should not focus too much on the actual numbers that are reported. There is a good reason that statisticians use the term \u2018estimates\u2019 when reporting statistical measures. I am not suggesting that we do away with statistics altogether but we should exercise considerable care in our use and reliance on them, particularly in our attempts to compare situations between countries."

    "content": "THE DEADLY 15 June 2020 clash between Chinese and Indian troops at the Galwan Valley, Ladakh, has threatened to make war a realistic scenario between the two nuclear armed countries. Both sides have been building up their military capabilities near the conflict site to prepare for worst-case scenarios. If things get worse, the clash could push Sino-Indian relations to a different trajectory pitting them as full strategic rivals. Given this context, the two sides must strive for more strategic dialogues and confidence-building, not less. After the clash, many in India have called into question the utility of such efforts. This is a mistake. If China and India walk away from mutual engagement, the end result could be prolonged strategic rivalry, arms race, and rising prospect of major war. Most Dangerous Great Power Relationship Sino-Indian relations are unfortunately trapped in the most dangerous great power relationship in the world. Power dynamics, territorial disputes, and the lack of third- party restraint provide a toxic mix of triggers of war. Traditionally, power shifts provide impetus for rivalry among the great powers. According to neorealism, which was coined by American political scientist Kenneth Waltz, the anarchic order of international relations makes great powers highly wary of balance of power changes. Rising powers inevitably cause others to assume the worst and that makes the security dilemma between them unavoidable. China and India are both rising powers and this fact has made their relationship even more prone to the security dilemma. The results are mutual insecurity, recurring crises, as well as rising probabilities of war. According to Waltz, the security dilemma makes war more likely even between two defensively-motivated countries. During a crisis, mutual exaggeration of hostile intentions may provide incentives to both parties to launch pre-emptive attacks. Territorial disputes between China and India provide catalysts for crisis, escalation, and war. While they have not been able to decide their border by a permanent settlement, even the so-called Line of Actual Control (LAC) is fluid and murky. Both sides send their militaries into the contested areas along the LAC to conduct patrols or build infrastructures. The inevitable outcomes are frequent and dangerous face-offs, which culminated in the 15 June clash which led to the many deaths on both sides, although the numbers on the Chinese side remain unverified. Dangerous Lack of Third-Party Restraint According to the scholar of international relations, Stephen Kocs, the existence of a territorial dispute between contiguous neighbours is a key variable in determining whether war occurs. War is many times more frequent in cases where states dispute their shared boundary than in cases where the boundary is clearly delimited and legally valid. However, what makes Sino-Indian relations the most dangerous great power relationship in the world concerns the lack of third-party restraint. While China-Japan relations also exhibit the effects of power dynamics and territorial dispute, the United States can tame their conflicts. Washington, through its alliance system, both deters China and restrains Japan. Indeed, the US played this role during the 2012-13 Sino-Japanese conflict in the East China Sea. As a result, a major war scenario between China and Japan is extremely low due to the presence of third-party restraint, which denies incentives for escalation in a crisis scenario. In contrast, no third-party factor exists in a bilateral crisis between China and India. Instead, China and India, standing alone, both feel compelled to stand firm in a crisis, fearing loss of face and reputation and the weakening of future deterrence. These concerns thus trap both parties in a vicious cycle escalation. Strategic Confidence-Building Must Continue To restrain the security dilemma and minimise prospects of military conflicts, China and India, to be sure, have made exemplary efforts in recent years to foster mutual confidence. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping have in fact invested personal capitals in the above efforts. Their frequent bilateral summit meetings were designed to facilitate communications, eliminate mutual concerns, and build strategic trust. These efforts have paid off. For example, after maintaining silence on the 15 June clash for a few days, Modi stated on 19 June that \u201cChina did not enter our territory, no posts taken\u201d. These were obvious efforts by Modi to contain Indian domestic nationalism and they should have served to restrain the escalation between the two countries. Now, some in India suggest that the 15 June clash offers proof of the failure of confidence-building efforts. As such, India must fundamentally re-orient its China policy. This is a dangerous approach to Sino-India relations. That clash was caused by tactical situations along the fluid and contested LAC and was not an exhibition of strategic dynamics between the two countries. Prime Minister Modi\u2019s efforts to restrain domestic nationalism actually proves the utility of strategic confidence-building. Better Jaw-Jaw than War-War If the two countries walk away from mutual engagement, the trajectory of their relationship would take a dangerous turn toward strategic conflict, even war. Therefore, both need to be willing to continue their previous efforts to cultivate mutual trust. To quote Harold Macmillan, who paraphrased Winston Churchill, \u201cto jaw-jaw is always better than to war-war\u201d. In other words, to \"talk-talk\" is better than to \"fight-fight\". Both must be aware that their territorial conflicts represent historical legacies of imperialism and colonial rule and they must try together to overcome these legacies. Without these efforts, the peculiar mixture of power dynamics, territorial dispute and the lack of third-party restraint trap China and India in the most dangerous great power relationship in the world. Indeed, the most likely major war scenario concerns Sino- Indian conflicts in the Himalayan region, not Sino-Japanese conflicts in the East China Sea or Sino-US conflicts in the South China Sea."

    "title": "US-Iran Hostility in the Pandemic Era",
    "author(s)": "By Amin Saikal",
    "date": "No. 097 \u2013 19 May 2020",
    "content": "THE UNITED States and Iran are both being savaged by COVID-19, but there has been no let-up in their mutual hostility. President Donald Trump has ramped up his policy of \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 to tame the Iranian Islamic regime in conformity with what he regards as America\u2019s geopolitical interests. Iran\u2019s clerical leadership has refused to soften its defiance and resistance. Neither side\u2019s belligerent rhetoric and actions have so far paid off. A major confrontation between them remains a prospect for early next year, if Trump is re-elected. In the wake of the pandemic crisis, one would normally have expected the two protagonists to cool their enmity in favour of more urgent domestic needs. Yet, they have continued to trade barbs, with tensions remaining high between them. Locked in Major Collision Course In the last month alone, American forces and Iran-backed Shia militias have exchanged fire in Iraq, the Iranian and American navies have threatened each other in the Persian Gulf, and President Trump has ordered the US navy to \u2018shoot down\u2019 any hostile Iranian vessels. Washington has also blocked Tehran\u2019s request for a US$5 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund to cope with the virus\u2019s fallout. The launch of a military satellite into space in mid-April by the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which the Trump administration has designated a \u2018terrorist organisation\u2019, invited a stiff US response. While Tehran described the satellite as a \u2018multi-purpose\u2019 tool that expands the IRGC's \u2018strategic intelligence\u2019, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo condemned the development as yet another Iranian measure to enhance its aggressive missile capability. Washington is now reportedly preparing to pressure the UN Security Council to reinstate UN sanctions against Iran. The aim is to reinforce US withdrawal from the July 2015 Iran nuclear agreement (formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action \u2013 JCPOA), although Washington is no longer a party to the agreement and its resolution would be vetoed by Russia and China. The two sides remain locked in a major collision course, with Israel and Saudi Arabia on standby to support the US in the process. The focus on Iran as the main enemy has become an enduring catalyst in strategically binding the US and its regional allies. This factor is unlikely to weaken under Trump or even possibly after Trump as long as there is strong bipartisan opposition to Tehran in the US Congress. Iran\u2019s Options Amid Predicament The Iranian regime is now in a very difficult predicament. It needs to deal with the combined economic and social effects of the coronavirus and US sanctions with diminishing resources but growing public urgency. What are Iran\u2019s policy options to cope with a very dire situation? One is to sit tight until the outcome of America\u2019s presidential election in November, in case Trump loses to Joe Biden, who is likely to be less combative towards Iran. But this cannot provide immunity from growing public discontent that had resulted in widespread political and social unrest prior to the advent of COVID-19. The Iranian society has borne the brunt of damages caused by the virus and sanctions as well as a politically pluralist theocratic system of governance that has not worked well. It is in need of immediate and long-term relief. The second option is to start renegotiating those JCPOA items that would make the Trump administration lift some of its draconian sanctions. This is not an option that sits well with the conservative forces in the ruling clerical class under Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who dominates the levers of power. However, moderate President Hassan Rouhani has indicated that he would be open to dialogue with Washington, provided that the US drops its sanctions as a prelude to such a dialogue. If this happens, it would entice the less ideological and more pragmatic conservative elements to support Rouhani\u2019s efforts, as they had done over the JCPOA. Enmeshing the Options The third option is enmeshed with the second. It requires the regime to retrench its exorbitant regional security costs by reducing its sponsorship of various forces in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. This measure also has its own difficulties, as the regime\u2019s domestic security is deeply intertwined with that of its regional entanglements. But it could address the issue by focusing mainly on its national defence in protecting Iran\u2019s borders against the backdrop of reaching a modus vivendi with the US. This would also lessen the grounds for Iran\u2019s regional rivals, Israel and Saudi Arabia, to view the country as a formidable threat. The regime has proved to be inventive and pragmatic on many occasions in the past. It now needs to engage in another process of domestic and foreign policy reorientation in a changed COVID-19 world. The alternative to this is the widening of the gulf and struggle between state and society in Iran and the country\u2019s oil riches being sucked in by more costly and potentially unmanageable internal and external challenges."

    "title": "Global Health Security: COVID-19 & Its Impacts China-Taiwan Mask Diplomacy: Wooing Southeast Asia?",
    "author(s)": "By Frederick Kliem and Alan Chong",
    "date": "No. 085 \u2013 8 May 2020",
    "content": "A FRIEND in need is a friend indeed, according to a time-honoured adage. With the infection chains seemingly under control in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and Taiwan in April 2020, both governments have pivoted to international assistance with medical equipment and expertise. This opens up a new front in the ongoing diplomatic battle for political space between both sides of the Taiwan Strait. Conveniently, this development has dodged the question of whether Chinese authorities underestimated or downplayed the severity of the virus at its epicentre. But Beijing performed a remarkable effort in managing the pandemic eventually, and it initiated international relief efforts to mitigate its tarnished image abroad. From Hero to Zero and Back While PRC support is both welcomed and needed almost everywhere, early relief efforts were undermined by mediocre equipment and inept diplomatic attempts to rewrite the COVID-19 narrative. As for Taiwan, it has been globally acknowledged for successfully managing COVID-19 and is now turning the crisis into a public relations coup. Despite fears of antagonising Beijing, ASEAN states stand to gain as both Taipei and Beijing woo their friends in the region. Beijing\u2019s medical soft power was premiered in Europe. While European countries turned to self-help and isolation and Italy\u2019s first request for European solidarity failed, Beijing stepped in to provide medical experts, millions of facemasks and test-kits. However, this campaign quickly hit roadblocks, as EU officials warned of Beijing\u2019s aggressive global image campaigns vis-\u00e0-vis Washington. Initial Chinese reputational gains were quickly damaged when the German government acknowledged that Chinese diplomats had contacted the German interior ministry with the intent to elicit positive public comments on China\u2019s COVID-19 management. As time went on, reports emerged of faulty Chinese equipment, and public criticism grew regarding the inflated fanfare with which China delivered its PPE. Nonetheless, equipment standards are improving, and Chinese support continues to make a substantial difference, especially if weighed against the virtual absence of US leadership and a missing EU response in the initial stages of the pandemic. And this will go a long way towards enhancing Beijing\u2019s standing and reputation. PRC Assistance to ASEAN Notwithstanding the setbacks in Europe, Beijing has been keen to demonstrate its ability to be a responsible regional leader and provider of public goods in Southeast Asia. Within the ASEAN Plus Three (APT) cooperation framework, China agreed to substantially contribute to ASEAN\u2019s ability to manage the pandemic and its consequences, by setting-up an APT medical supply stockpile and, crucially, committing to contribute to the joint ASEAN Response Fund. The PRC also continues to ship medical equipment, PPE, medicines and experts across the region. On 21 April 2020, China donated masks, sanitisers and thermometers to the ASEAN Secretariat to ensure their continued operations and will provide 100 million face masks, 10 million pieces of protective gear and urgently needed medical supplies to individual member states. Most ASEAN member states have benefitted from Chinese support by now. But it will be unsurprising for observers of Sino-ASEAN relations that Cambodia and Laos are particularly targeted, and are supported financially and with medical experts and equipment. One Thai observer warned that Indochina faced the dilemma of \u2018suffering with\u2019 or \u2018suffering against\u2019 China in the battle against COVID-19. Taiwan\u2019s Once-in-a-Generation Opportunity Even as the Chinese epicentre in Hubei province had its lockdown lifted, Taipei simultaneously emerged as one of the success stories in battling COVID-19. Despite being largely shut out of the World Health Organisation (WHO), leaders around the world look to Taiwan for a model response. Taiwan\u2019s President Tsai Ing-Wen even authored a self-congratulatory article in Time Magazine positing that Taiwan\u2019s success was the result of contact tracing, strategic imposition of quarantines and timely medical responses. Taipei was already one of the world\u2019s largest suppliers of PPE, particularly face masks, and trading on Taiwan\u2019s sound industrial infrastructure, it augmented production substantially. Taipei is now offering donations to Coronavirus-stricken countries all over the world. Since the Sino-US rapprochement in the 1970s, Taiwan has struggled with diplomatic recognition, and in recent years, its diplomatic allies dwindled to a mere 15. Yet, Taipei now has a rare opportunity to leverage its COVID-19 success and gain diplomatic capital vis-\u00e0-vis China. Taiwan\u2019s Re-Connection with WHO? In two waves of COVID-19 assistance, Taipei donated millions of urgently needed face masks to countries in Asia and Europe. The government specifically ties this effort to its New Southbound Policy strategy. This is President Tsai\u2019s initiative to enhance cooperation and exchanges between Taiwan and 18 targeted countries in Asia in a bid to be less dependent on the PRC and deepen regional relationships independently. 200,000 masks went to Southern Thailand, where COVID-19 had escalated. Taiwan also sent other PPE items and is cooperating with those countries to develop vaccines and test-kits. Taiwan\u2019s foreign minister specifically used the opportunity to chastise the WHO\u2019s alleged China bias. According to Minister Joseph Wu, Taiwan stands at the frontline of global epidemic prevention efforts and is ready to assist the global community \u2013 whether the WHO continued to cave in to China\u2019s unreasonable interference or not. With its efforts to fill the PPE gap and other shortages, Taipei stands to gain substantial international reputation and recognition. Soft Power Rivalry With Beijing and Washington embroiled in a tit-for-tat vendetta, Taipei may have found its soft power niche by simply appearing constructive and non-political in combating the pandemic. Beijing\u2019s cause has also been set back by glitches such as the insensitive YouTube aid promotion video in the Philippines featuring the theme of Iisang Dagat (One Sea). This hurt Filipino feelings since it implied that China was advancing its claim that the South China Sea was rightfully theirs \u2500 under the cover of medical aid. The soft power rivalry between Taipei and Beijing will be drawn out if the WHO\u2019s pronouncements continue predicting a long haul global effort. ASEAN member states should not fear accepting rival aid from both sides despite Beijing\u2019s automatic admonition of parleys with Taipei. However, the One China policy needs to be maintained pursuant to established ASEAN operating principles. Southeast Asian governments should balance national autonomy with humanitarian needs. They should loudly proclaim the need to accept aid from any quarter so long as it is offered with sincere palliative care for all human beings regardless of nationality."

    "title": "Vietnam\u2019s 13th CPV Congress: New Leaders, New Vision 2045?",
    "author(s)": "By Yang Razali Kassim",
    "date": "No. 016 \u2013 29 January 2021",
    "content": "THE 13th NATIONAL Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV), now under way in Hanoi from 25 January till 2 February 2021, comes at a crucial time. This is a significant event as the country embarks on a leadership transition that will take it to a new vision of Vietnam in 2045 \u2013 as a \u201cdeveloped economy with socialist orientation\u201d. A crucial decision of the five-yearly CPV Congress will be whether to return to the \u201cFour-Pillars\u201d power-sharing structure \u2013 the party general secretary, president, prime minister, and the national assembly chair. These are the four most powerful political positions in the country\u2019s top leadership. In 2018, party chief Nguyen Phu Trong stepped into the president\u2019s post when the incumbent died. Whether the party will revert to the traditional four-pillar model is one of the key things to watch at this congress. Returning to the Four Pillars of Leadership? Should the 76-year-old Trong step down from his dual position as president and party general secretary, two personalities could be in contention to succeed. The first is Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc as party chief. The second is Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh as president. If Minh\u2019s elevation materialises, it may signal Vietnam\u2019s deeper integration with ASEAN as Minh has been a frontliner in Vietnam\u2019s role in the regional grouping. Vietnam\u2019s core leadership has traditionally reflected the four poles in the country\u2019s power balance. Apart from the party chief \u2013 officially known as the general secretary of CPV \u2013 and the state president, the other two are the prime minister as head of government, and the National Assembly chair as head of the legislature. Speculation has been on whether Trong, a two-term party chief, will relinquish both his posts or one of them. Should Trong continue for a third term, he will be the longest- serving party general secretary since Le Duan, who succeeded revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh. To be sure, Vietnamese watchers say, the leadership transition is opaque and secretive, giving rise to much speculation. But should Trong step down, the party chief\u2019s post may be filled by Prime Minister Phuc, 66, or Tran Quoc Vuong, the 67- year-old anti-corruption chief who is currently a member of the CPV Secretariat. Another candidate for prime minister is Vuong Dinh Hue, 63, a former deputy prime minister and the current Hanoi party secretary. The position of chairperson of the National Assembly is no less important. Some scholars of Vietnamese politics expect this to be a contest between Truong Thi Mai, the woman head of the CPV commission on mass mobilisation, and Pham Minh Chinh, the head of another CPV commission on personnel and organisation. Hue is also reported to be in the running. Vision 2045: Vietnam as a Developed Economy Under the CPV leadership, Vietnam has strongly maintained its political stability, economic growth as well as extensive integration into the regional and global economy. It is noteworthy that the main candidates for the top four leadership positions are either highly educated or economics-trained. For example, president-cum-CPV chief Trong is a Russian-speaking professor with a PhD in politics. Whoever emerged as the top four, they will be responsible for the country\u2019s next lap. Vietnamese media say several draft documents have been submitted to the CPV Congress that will, among other things, review the country\u2019s \u201crenovation\u201d and define two milestones. The first is 2030 \u2013 a landmark coinciding with the 100th anniversary of the CPV\u2019s establishment. The second is a bold agenda of a new national Vision 2045, coinciding with the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, now the unified Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The main objectives of the communist leadership are to transform Vietnam into a socialist-oriented developed country by the middle of the 21st century. This vision will be realised in three phases: By 2025, Vietnam is set to surpass the low-middle-income developing nation status. By 2030, it will strive to become a developing nation with modern industry and upper- middle-income status. By 2045, Vietnam will become a developed, high-income socialist-oriented economy. These ambitious goals, however, will depend much on how Vietnam manages to balance its post-pandemic reforms with stability. That is why the 13th party congress is so vital to determine the future trajectory of Vietnam by putting in place the right leadership at the core of the power balance. CPV\u2019s Central Role Central to all these changes is the pivotal role of the CPV. Vietnam is already one of the few countries that have a sustained economic expansion despite the COVID-19 pandemic. The CPV\u2019s steering role is in laying down the national direction, taking into account strategic changes in the country, surrounding region and globally. Significantly, the CPV has also made adjustments to its Doi Moi (renewal) process of the socialist-oriented market economy, thereby helping it to develop with stability despite the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 or not, Vietnam has managed to raise its profile and played a constructive role in the international arena as it pursues its external policy of peace and to be friends to all countries. Vietnam\u2019s success in managing the COVID-19 pandemic is due to the close and symbiotic partnership between the CPV and the government. Vietnam\u2019s Foreign Policy & ASEAN In 1995, Vietnam joined ASEAN. Since then, Vietnam has been one of the most economically-dynamic countries in Southeast Asia. When it took over the rotating ASEAN chair last year, ASEAN reaffirmed the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea as the basis of sovereign rights and claims in the South China Sea, which Hanoi calls the East Sea. Vietnam is one of the claimant states. Also last year, under a Vietnam-led ASEAN, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) was signed, creating the world\u2019s largest free trade agreement. The RCEP was a breakthrough for Vietnam\u2019s pursuit of international economic integration. Vietnam also concluded other FTAs such as the EU-Vietnam FTA (EVFTA) and the UK-Vietnam FTA (UKVFTA), thereby creating new impetus for the nation\u2019s economic growth trajectory. Also in 2020, Vietnam became a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for the 2020-2021 term. Vietnam\u2019s active role in international economic relations has smoothen the way to diversify its markets and partners, attract resources for development, and complete the goal of rapid, sustainable recovery from the pandemic. Its chairmanship of ASEAN last year and its non-permanent membership of the UN Security Council have helped Vietnam raise further its profile and influence on the regional and international stage. Whoever fill the Four Pillars of Leadership next week will have to shoulder and sustain the mission of taking Vietnam into the next phase and realising Vision 2045. This is even as the country strives to become a peaceful influential player in the geopolitics of a region that is getting increasingly tense due to the volatility of the South China Sea and the unresolved big power competition between the US and China in the wider Asia-Pacific region."

    "title": "Global Health Security: COVID-19 & Its Impacts BRICS in Time of Pandemic: Leadership from Emerging Economies?",
    "author(s)": "By Nazia Hussain",
    "date": "No. 102 \u2013 22 May 2020",
    "content": "FOREIGN MINISTERS of the five large emerging BRICS economies \u2500 Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa \u2500 met for a video conference on 28 April 2020 to review the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on trade and investment among BRICS member states. The meeting was ahead of the bloc\u2019s scheduled July summit in St. Petersburg. This innocuous gathering comes at a time when established international institutions, designed to serve a United States-led liberal order, have lost their credibility. The escalating row between Washington and Beijing over the role of the World Health Organisation (WHO) in handling the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a last-minute cancellation of a second virtual summit of G20 leaders. The Trump administration has suspended funding to the WHO. The EU, the UN and G7 too have come under fire for their inadequate COVID-19 action plans. Meanwhile, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) struggles to maintain its relevance as its dispute settlement function is at risk of collapsing. Moreover, nations under lockdown have resorted to panicked protectionism to secure food supplies and medical equipment. BRICS Response to COVID-19 Amidst the crisis, a concerted BRICS effort could offer a new paradigm for multilateral institutions and shape the discourse in global governance from an emerging countries\u2019 perspective. A BRICS-driven initiative could serve to underscore the potential of the bloc which not only spans across continents but makes up 42 per cent of the world population and 23 per cent of global GDP. Individual initiatives by BRICS member states are already underway. India is already providing pharmaceutical assistance to nearly 85 nations on a grant basis to support their response to the pandemic. China has leveraged its manufacturing capacity to provide personal protective equipment to hotspots across the globe under its Health Silk Road diplomacy. Russia has launched its air mission \u2014 \u2018From Russia with Love\u2019 \u2014 flying medical supplies to Italy while a Russian Antonov-124 packed with medical aid headed to New York. Meanwhile, South Africa is engaged in framing a pan-African response to COVID-19. Brazil is the only BRICS member state in need of a reassessment as President Bolsonaro continues to resist lockdown measures even as infections continue to soar. Need for Overhaul To supplement the individual efforts of BRICS countries, existing BRICS mechanisms have been activated. The ministers agreed to allocate US$15 billion to the Shanghai- based BRICS New Development Bank (NDB) towards a special loan instrument for BRICS economies to counteract the economic fallout of the pandemic. The NDB has been moving quickly to help affected countries recoup some of their financial losses \u2500 the bank has already disbursed $1 billion emergency loan to China and India, and subsequently to South Africa. Moreover, BRICS countries are expecting to step up cooperation in the healthcare sector, accelerating the process of setting up the BRICS Vaccine Research and Development Centre. The institutionalisation of BRICS \u2013 with the creation of the New Development Bank (NDB) which holds a lending portfolio of more than $15 billion and a Contingent Reserve Arrangement with a capital of $100 billion \u2013 alleviates some degree of scepticism towards the bloc which has often been dismissed as a non-starter. Although BRICS has been lauded for attempting to provide emerging countries with Bretton Woods alternatives to existing multilateral development banks, the NDB has been criticised for lack of transparency and due diligence on its lending practices. Need to Deliver on Results Despite claiming to promote sustainable infrastructure and proper governance, the NDB met out a $200 million loan to Transnet \u2013 a controversial South African majority state-owned enterprise \u2013 to finance the expansion of the Durban port-petrochemical complex amidst fears that not enough due diligence was done in granting the loan. Moreover, the NDB decided to loan $180 million to Eskom \u2013 a power utilities company which is severely in debt and mired in a corruption scandal. The NDB would do well to practice transparency and due diligence to assuage concerns and criticisms on project financing; more than 100 environmental activists led by four African Goldman Prize winners protested against the NDB at the start of the BRICS Johannesburg summit in 2018. Besides an overhaul of its financial mechanisms, member states need to deliver on implementation of initiatives already in the pipeline. Although countering pandemics, vaccination, joint medical programs, including telemedicine, have long been prominent on the BRICS agenda, failure to follow through has marred the credibility of the bloc in the past. Reformed Multilateralism Noting that the pandemic and its subsequent ramifications highlight the need for reform of multilateral systems, Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar called for a \u2018reformed multilateralism\u2019 focused on the centrality of development and growth in the global agenda. New Delhi has initiated a joint South Asian response to COVID-19 by activating the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), despite the grouping being in a stalemate since 2016 with a cancelled summit as tensions heightened between India and Pakistan. The BRICS foreign ministers\u2019 pledge for a concerted effort by emerging economies in tackling the pandemic is a step in the right direction even as internal dynamics between member states are being navigated. While India and China remain embroiled in a territorial dispute along the Himalayan frontier, the BRICS member states remain at odds over the expansion of the UN Security Council. With vested interests in the existing system, Russia and China frequently do not go beyond rhetoric in supporting Brazil, India and South Africa\u2019s greater roles in the UN. Even a decade after its inception, observers remain sceptical of this oddly divergent grouping with different socio-cultural and political systems, whose economies are in different stages of development, and who share some degree of ideological dissonance. As BRICS seeks to influence and shape the norms of global governance, the onus falls on member states to preserve a modicum of policy coordination \u2013 at best a ragged unison \u2013 in order to outperform the other multilateral institutions of the liberal order."

    "content": "IN THE 1980s, journalists covering Southeast Asia would be most familiar with a prominent foreign personality by the name of Nguyen Co Thach. He was the foreign minister of Vietnam. As its chief diplomat, Thach was the face of an ideological foe \u2500 mainland Southeast Asia\u2019s strongest country, with a battle-hardened army. A decade earlier, Vietnamese forces had defeated the mighty United States military, unifying North and South Vietnam. Not long after that victory, Vietnamese troops had gone into neighbouring Cambodia, helping to overthrow the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime. To ASEAN, then still a five- member regional grouping, Vietnam\u2019s move into Cambodia was \u201ca threat\u201d to the rest of Southeast Asia. There was fear of a domino effect. After Cambodia, would it be Thailand, followed by Malaysia and then Singapore? Events over the next four decades, however, took a different trajectory. Vietnam\u2019s Historic Entry into ASEAN This turn began when ASEAN launched a diplomatic campaign soon after, mobilising the international community through the United Nations, to oppose the Vietnamese venture into Cambodia. One of the most vocal ASEAN campaigners was Singapore\u2019s foreign minister S. Rajaratnam. Hanoi defended its Cambodia move by accepting ASEAN\u2019s offer of diplomatic engagement. It was in the context of this series of \u201cpeace talks\u201d that Thach frequently travelled to ASEAN. As Vietnam was increasingly isolated diplomatically at the UN, Thach stood his ground in Southeast Asia, defending Hanoi\u2019s position. But global events were undergoing a tsunamic upheaval. In 1989, the Berlin Wall fell. Not long after, the Soviet Union disintegrated. The tectonic wave led to the collapse of the global communist order, leading to a fundamental shift in development ideology from a pure communist model to a hybrid socialist centrally-planned economy with a capitalist engine. Against this changing global backdrop, Vietnam eventually withdrew from Cambodia, also in 1989. That was a turning point for Southeast Asia: As the Cold War\u2019s ideological standoff between communism and capitalism ended, so did the enmity between ASEAN and Vietnam. The biggest turn of the tide in Southeast Asia was when Vietnam subsequently decided to join ASEAN, its former foe. This was soon after Vietnam launched doi moi \u2500 its own transition from a centralised economy to a \u201csocialist-oriented market economy\u201d. In 1995, Vietnam formally joined ASEAN as Hanoi saw that its economic future lay in hitching onto the ASEAN bandwagon. Vietnam Relations with ASEAN and Singapore Since its entry into ASEAN, Vietnam\u2019s relations with the rest of Southeast Asia have never been better. Indeed, Hanoi\u2019s membership was followed by the admission of Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia. This significantly led to the historic unification of mainland and maritime Southeast Asia. After 25 years in ASEAN, the Vietnamese economy has developed rapidly. It is now one of the fastest growing new economies in Asia. This positive change is widely acknowledged by ASEAN leaders. One of the engines of Vietnam\u2019s rapid economic growth as an ASEAN member is its bilateral ties with the more developed ASEAN economies, especially Singapore. It can be said that a bedrock of ASEAN\u2019s group cohesion is Vietnam\u2019s excellent and multi-facetted relations with Singapore. In 2013, the bilateral relationship was elevated to that of a Strategic Partnership. A highlight of Singapore-Vietnamese relations was the official visit of Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc in 2018, in conjunction with the 45th anniversary of bilateral diplomatic relations. Both their leaders stressed that extensive investment and trade ties formed a key pillar of Singapore-Vietnam ties. Singapore firms have consistently invested in Vietnam through the years. In 2017, Singapore\u2019s cumulative investment hit US$43 billion across 1,800 projects, making Singapore Vietnam\u2019s largest investor in ASEAN, and the third-largest on a global basis. According to Singapore-based analysts, the Vietnamese economy in 10 years\u2019 time would be bigger than the size of the Singapore economy \u2500 which is ASEAN\u2019s most developed. According to the World Bank, Vietnam is strongly positioned to benefit from numerous ASEAN and bilateral free trade agreements. Vietnamese Leadership Role in ASEAN The first time Hanoi took up ASEAN chairmanship was in 1998 \u2500 just three years after it joined ASEAN. As its confidence grew, Vietnam took up the rotating chair again in 2010. On 4 November 2019, for the third time, Vietnam formally took over the chair from Thailand, paving the way for its stewardship of ASEAN this year. ASEAN chairmanship is significant as it underscored the depth of mutual trust and comradeship that the rest of ASEAN has in Hanoi. It must not be forgotten that when it joined ASEAN in 1995, Vietnam was the first Communist country to join what essentially was a capitalist-driven regional grouping. As this year\u2019s Chair, Vietnam\u2019s objective is for ASEAN to be \u201cCohesive and Responsive\u201d. Cohesiveness refers to Hanoi\u2019s aim to reinforce ASEAN unity and solidarity in the face of common challenges. Responsiveness demonstrates its hope to develop ASEAN resilience to shocks and crisis. COVID-19 was indeed a big shock. The pandemic was unprecedented, wreaking havoc globally and in Southeast Asia just as Hanoi took over the rotating ASEAN Chair. COVID-19 is no doubt the toughest of three challenges. The first is the trade war between the US and China. While the US is now one of Hanoi\u2019s most important trading partners, China is Vietnam\u2019s biggest neighbour and largest trading ally. Yet, China is also Vietnam\u2019s second toughest source of potential conflict. As ASEAN Chair, Hanoi\u2019s territorial dispute with Beijing in the South China Sea can be very demanding and tense. As the third and biggest challenge, the pandemic is severely testing Vietnam\u2019s role as ASEAN Chair. While Vietnam has to rally ASEAN towards a common strategy to fight the deadly virus, it also has to take care of its homefront. Vietnam\u2019s firm prevention strategy eventually slowed down the spread of the disease, having just 342 confirmed cases and no deaths as of 18 June 2020. Vietnam is now touted as a model for how to successfully manage COVID-19 infection. Overcoming Setbacks Vietnam\u2019s chairmanship suffered a setback when the COVID-19 crisis forced the postponement of the US-ASEAN Summit and the ASEAN Summit originally scheduled for April 2020. Amid lockdown conditions across the region, Vietnam hosted the first teleconference of the ASEAN Coordinating Council Working Group on public health emergencies. Vietnam then hosted a special virtual ASEAN Plus Three (APT) Summit on 14 April with China, Japan and South Korea, which led to a decision to set up a joint fund to fight COVID-19. At the special APT Summit, Singapore\u2019s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong emphasised how critical it was for ASEAN to mount a united response to the pandemic \u201cbecause of how connected and interdependent we are\u201d. Against the current exacting backdrop, Vietnam is hosting online the delayed ASEAN Summit this Friday (26 June). At the forefront of multilateralism and diplomacy, preparing for ASEAN and related meetings is Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh. Interestingly, he is also the son of the former foreign minister Thach, whose birth name was Pham Van Cuong \u2500 the man at the centre of the Vietnam-ASEAN diplomatic imbroglio in the 1980s. As Vietnam competently coordinates and marshals fellow member states to manage their challenges together, Foreign Minister Minh demonstrates Hanoi's resolve to advance a cohesive and responsive ASEAN -- ironically the same group his father once engaged in diplomatic battle with."

    "title": "Sri Lanka Elections: Stronger Powers, at What Cost?",
    "author(s)": "By Roshni Kapur",
    "date": "No. 155 \u2013 11 August 2020",
    "content": "THE GOVERNMENT of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has won a \u2018super-majority\u2019 at the recent parliamentary elections securing 59% of the votes. The main opposition, Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) led by Sajith Premadasa, received around 23% of the votes. While the government was expected to do well, its massive victory is unprecedented. Gotabaya\u2019s party, the Sri Lanka Podujana Party (SLPP), secured 145 seats, just five short of a two-thirds majority. It will require simply five more seats from the minor parties to make policy changes without much difficulty. Riding on the Pandemic The elections were held during the government\u2019s honeymoon period and its popularity was at an all-time high. The SLPP\u2019s campaign messaging resonated with many voters. It continued a similar trajectory at the 2019 presidential election by campaigning on a platform on national security, centralised leadership and economic development. Moreover, the government\u2019s handling of the COVID-19 crisis has won some praise. There was an effective management and containment of the pandemic with low mortality rate of 11 deaths and 2,900 confirmed cases. This election has also legitimised Mahinda Rajapakasa\u2019s role as prime minister who led the party\u2019s election campaign. He has returned to power despite allegations that his presidency was plagued with corruption, autocracy and nepotism. The return of the Rajapaksa family after a five-year hiatus has reinstated a sense of national security and political stability that was largely missing during the previous government under former President Maithripala Sirisena and former prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Constitutional Amendments The government will now have the power to make sweeping constitutional changes to strengthen the executive presidency. \u201cWe have seen in the past when governments have had a two-thirds majority (they do) not have to worry about checks and balances,\u201d historian and political scientist Jayadeva Uyangoda has said. It is likely that the administration will repeal an amendment to the constitution that was passed by the previous United National Front for Good Governance (Yahapalana) government in 2015. This reform curtailed the president\u2019s powers and conferred more power to the prime minister, parliament, judiciary, police and other institutions. It also established independent commissions to keep a check on the police and judiciary. The Gotabaya government argues that the amendment resulted in weak governance and leadership. It thinks that restoring full executive powers is imperative to enforce its plan of making the country economically and militarily stable, although no timeline has been stated. The removal of the two-term limit on the presidency will also enable Mahinda to contest the next elections. Many analysts have contended the trend of centralisation of powers has been increasing ever since the Gotabaya administration came to power. While the military has usually played a key role in the Sri Lankan society, Gotabaya has taken it a step further by appointing many former and serving military personnel to significant civilian positions. For instance, former major general Kamal Gunaratna has been appointed the new defence secretary and chairman of the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka. Human Rights and Minority Concerns Moreover, several institutions such as the NGO secretariat are now under the defence ministry. There are apprehensions that the civic space and liberty that was restored during the Yahapalana government\u2019s tenure is under threat now. Several international human rights groups including the Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have issued a joint letter urging the current government to stop targeted arrests and intimidation of activists, lawyers and human rights activists. There is also anxiety whether the government will take steps to protect the interests of the minority communities. Its withdrawal from the United Nations resolution 30/1 on accountability and reconciliation in February 2020 was a clear indication it will not cooperate with the international community on wartime inquiries. Although it assured the Tamil community that it would set up a domestic commission of inquiry, no steps have been taken so far. Rising Islamophobia that cuts across the urban and rural divide is a growing phenomenon in the country. The forced cremation policy implemented by the government evidently hurt the sentiments of the Muslim community given that cremating a deceased body is a contravention of Islamic burial rites. The local media propagated unfounded claims that the Muslim community was responsible for the spread of the coronavirus. Challenges Ahead Securing a parliamentary majority is simply one challenge that the government has overcome. While constitutional reforms can wait, the shambling economy, national security and ethnic question should be prioritised. The country\u2019s economy shrank by 1.6% in the first quarter of 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic that hit the tourism sector massively. Hence the government has a difficult task of reviving the economy and rebuilding investor confidence in the wake of the ensuing pandemic. On the foreign policy side, Gotabaya has emphasised that his administration will follow an equidistant and non- aligned foreign policy. However diplomatic communication between Western countries and Sri Lanka could prove challenging given that there has been mutual discomfort between the two during Mahinda\u2019s presidency. The West would need to accept the ground realities and rethink its engagement with the Rajapaksas. Although the government has its job cut out for the next term, returning to a path of alleged authoritarianism and centralisation of powers could backfire and limit its opportunity to get re-elected in five years\u2019 time. Despite Mahinda\u2019s landslide victory at the 2010 presidential elections, he was ousted at the 2015 presidential poll when anti- incumbency effects were high. The Sirisena-led opposition that had formed a coalition with many political and civic bodies campaigned on a platform of good governance, transparency, accountability and integrity. That resonated well with the public. This time, if Premadasa manages to mobilise the key opposition, it could increase his political fortunes at the next presidential election."

    "title": "Women in Global Governance: Never Ending Fight for Equality?",
    "author(s)": "By Tamara Nair",
    "date": "No. 039 \u2013 13 March 2020",
    "content": "WOMEN TODAY stand on the shoulders of giants. That women are seen and heard on the global stage in all areas of governance is a great achievement and in large part marks the success of more than a century of protests, sacrifices and intense negotiations at so many levels by dedicated women and men, unwavering in their demands for equality. Now women lead transnational corporations, international and non-governmental organisations; they head corporate boards and governments; they are members in the C-suite; they are educators and innovators. They have even gone to space! We see these changes globally. Global governance is about efforts to support development and safety of all humanity and addressing the role of peace-making that transcends borders. The issue of inclusivity, nevertheless, is still problematic, as the two instances below reflect. Inclusive Pandemic Preparedness Covid-19, tearing its way through the world, has revealed some stark deficiencies in national and global pandemic preparedness. Expectant mothers in China face uncertainty as several hospitals and healthcare professionals prioritise virus patients. The overburdened healthcare system has seemingly left them behind when maternity nurses and doctors have been redeployed to crisis centres. With community hospitals unavailable and no public transport to take them anywhere, several women face a dire situation of where to give birth. This becomes even more daunting for those facing complicated pregnancies. In a recent article, female health workers in China have been reprimanded for requesting feminine hygiene products, deemed as non-essential. Criticised by male colleagues for \u201clacking diligence and a spirit of devotion\u201d for making such requests, female health workers have had to encounter such harrowing experiences while at the same time, having to work round-the-clock looking after patients. That the differentiated experiences women face biologically is lost on medical professionals and in pandemic preparedness seems rather offensive. More so when the majority of healthcare workers, especially frontline workers like nurses, are female. To make matters worse, female nurses bear the burden of cultural and social expectations as care givers, not only to complete strangers but also in their homes. Yet another issue of concern pertains to female domestic workers, many of whom work in countries affected by Covid-19 in Southeast Asia. There are limited prospects for these women in their own countries hence they travel out to work. But how will travel restrictions affect them? And what is the impact on their long-term economic security and that of their dependents? Gender impacts should be a grave concern for those who deal with global health governance given women\u2019s immediate interaction with the old, young and sick members in their communities. Women have not been fully incorporated into global health governance mechanisms and there are insufficient policy spaces for women in national and global pandemic preparedness. Women and Peace-building In his State of the Union address in 2002, US President George W. Bush cited advances in women\u2019s rights as one of the key outcomes of the US invasion of Afghanistan. Many Afghani women have benefitted from his proclamation and for the past 18 years they have experienced the freedoms gained with the entry of the Americans. For years, the US promoted the idea of safeguarding Afghan women's rights as a part of the rationale for its fight against the Taliban. The Taliban's rule from 1996 to 2001 saw the reversal of women\u2019s right to education, economic security, and political participation. The Taliban exerted control over women by dictating their dress, and where, how and with whom they could be seen. Violators of these rules faced terrible repercussions including flogging in public. The recent peace deal signed between President Donald Trump and the Taliban has filled women and human rights activists with dread. The deal could jeopardize progress for Afghan women who have gained a foothold in the workplace and in political life, and this \u2018peace\u2019, however it may be defined, could very well be on the backs of women. With the lack of women\u2019s involvement in these talks, both the Afghani and US governments flout the most fundamental tenet of the UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325, which is premised on the complete and sustained involvement of women in peace talks and peace-building. The peace discussions also ignore Afghanistan\u2019s own National Action Plan on UNSCR 1325. Afghan women have always harboured fears that if their cause for freedom is lost on the international community, their newly won rights are done for. But the international community has almost no clear opinion of their plight. Long Road Ahead 2020 is a year of anniversaries for global women\u2019s rights and equality. This year marks the 10th anniversary of UN Women. It is the 20th anniversary of UNSCR 1325. The year also marks the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Platform for Action \u2013 the most progressive road map for gender equality and women\u2019s rights. The international community has put in place these two landmark proclamations to protect women and involve them in all aspects of social, political and economic lives. Nations have carried forward this call to be more aware and inclusive and for the most part this commitment has helped \u2018reveal\u2019 women\u2019s rights from \u2018behind the scenes\u2019 to \u2018front and centre\u2019 in international affairs. The constant demand for an inclusive and gender-sensitive approach to global governance are not merely the pursuits of particular interest groups. In many ways, a nation\u2019s quest of peace and development can be checked by the level of gender inequality that exists. International Women\u2019s Day was marked on 8 March 2020, a celebration that goes back some 108 years and commemorates women\u2019s achievements in history across the world. Also known as the UN Day for Women\u2019s Rights and International Peace, the significance of the date comes from actions of thousands of Russian women protesting in the streets to demand change and equality in 1917, on the very day in March. But the fact that it will take some 100 years for us to achieve any form of gender equality and 202 years to arrive at economic parity is a depressing thought. As the two examples above have highlighted we have not progressed enough, despite all of humanity\u2019s achievements, if we still cannot acknowledge an all-inclusive process in international affairs."

    "title": "Global Health Security COVID-19 Pandemic: What It Means for US National Security",
    "author(s)": "By Adam Garfinkle",
    "date": "No. 053 \u2013 30 March 2020",
    "content": "ALREADY AT this early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, a temperamental set-to has emerged between two poles: those who see the virus as revealing American institutional decay across the board, and view the playing out of the pandemic as worsening it; and those who espy a silver lining in the crisis cloud motivating bold reforms. One may be sceptical of breathless pronouncements in either direction, but the Overton Window -- the range of politically acceptable policies at any given time -- will certainly shift on many fronts. We speculate here on a few of them, moving from those of lesser and immediate to greater and longer-term import. Dilemma of Readiness All militaries involve amalgamations of soldiers, logisticians, administrators, and bureaucrats. If these amalgamations cannot form safely to exercise and train with allies, readiness will suffer, or else personnel will be ordered into situations that will sicken them in disproportionate numbers to a similar general result. All significant state militaries face similar dilemmas, but states whose policies rely more on allied cooperation will be affected disproportionately. In the longer term, defence planners are likely to factor mass-medical perturbations into doctrine and planning to a greater degree than before, in part because of an increased danger of bioterrorism (see below). Political culture and the happenstance of sagacious leadership will determine which countries devise superior best practices. The US is at no disadvantage here. Defence-industrial Base The economic swoon caused by the pandemic is damaging the US defence-industrial base relative to those of near-peer and other serious competitors. The reason is that the US system is far more market-based than others. Many other countries, including China and Russia, can readily prioritise state-owned defence industries in their economic management and recovery plans. It\u2019s not so simple in the US. Most large defence contractors can ride out the crisis, but third- and fourth-tier subcontractors are overwhelmingly composed of small businesses (those with 250- 1,500 employees) that cannot. These businesses compose the essential supply-chain not just for new equipment acquisitions but also for ongoing maintenance and readiness needs; if they go bankrupt, the entire system will degrade rapidly. That is why President Trump\u2019s failure to quickly implement the Defence Production Act (DPA) could bear significant implications. Title III of the Act enables the federal government to provide significant loans to smaller subcontractor firms, which are needed because the alternative -- Small Business Administration loans -- cannot cover even one month\u2019s payroll in most cases. The president\u2019s delay could trigger a rash of imminent bankruptcies. Moreover, while small firms should receive priority under the DPA, heavily lobbied US politics is such that they may not. Resource Shifting In the mid- to longer term, greater mindfulness of the national security implications of natural and man-made pandemic disease could lead to significant positive reforms in the US, as elsewhere. But a danger also exists that, given the size of the US national debt and the tendency to run annual federal budget deficits, the defence budget will be poached to excess to finance new public health preparation measures. As is well known, the US federal budget has become increasingly brittle to choice, with fiscally open-ended entitlement programmes taking up an increasing share of obligations. Discretionary spending falls disproportionately on defence, making it virtually the only place politicians can find funds for new priorities without ballooning the deficit and debt further. The meaning of \u201cto excess\u201d is obviously open to interpretation. But one consequence of a significant reduction of US defence investment, more likely if Democrats win the November elections, would be to undermine an already decaying US grand strategy predicated on providing common global security goods. This is in order to supress regional conflicts, arms races, and WMD proliferation, while keeping global commercial metabolism robust. Such a development would further incline US foreign policy, by default if not through thought, toward de facto isolationism -- sombre news for exposed US allies and friends worldwide. Manufactured Pandemics? The spectre of COVID-19 may have a demonstration effect of a deeply worrying kind. The world is entering a period when the capacity of \u201cbad\u201d or \u201ccrazy\u201d actors -- state and substate alike -- to manufacture pandemics is increasing. It is ever easier for small groups with limited budgets to create designer plagues, and to spring them onto unsuspecting populations with sufficient stealth that their man-made origins are obscured until too late. The COVID-19 crisis has revealed the massive damage to a capriciously designed globalised economy that a pandemic can cause. To certain radical revisionist actors, some likely motivated by non-traditional religious interpretations, what is unfolding today could encourage greater effort to acquire a decisive weapon for the weak and self-described dispossessed. Cultural Consequences Ultimately, the long-term security of any society is a function less of its state\u2019s military prowess or its economic might than of the attitudes and expectations of its people. The COVID-19 experience will add to the quotient of ambient fear already rife in American society from the sum of 911, the multifold shocks of the Great Recession, and the manifest dysfunction of US political institutions that enabled an entirely unqualified person to become president. Linked to fear is cynicism, alienation, and risk aversion, all of which undermine Americans\u2019 tradition of can-do pragmatism and Enlightenment-propelled optimism. No one can predict what COVID-19 will mean coming on top of these and other pre- existing cultural burdens. But one thing is clear: If enough Americans come to believe that their society is not virtuous and unified by noble purpose, and so does not merit exertions to preserve its security and world leadership role, no amount of defence spending will make much difference in the long run. Bold reform is possible, but to be truly effective it requires acting in concert with others. Global pandemics cannot be managed by national means alone. Absent a willingness to cooperate in new ways and old, a headlong US turning inward and subsequent decline is not so far-fetched. If the COVID-19 experience ends up accelerating that inward turning, it will surely be seen by posterity as a crisis wasted."

    "title": "Crises in Nagorno-Karabakh and Kyrgyzstan: Russia's Interests",
    "author(s)": "By Chris Cheang",
    "date": "No. 187 \u2013 29 October 2020",
    "content": "THE OUTBREAK of hostilities on 27 September 2020 over Nagorno-Karabakh (NK) between Armenia and Azerbaijan and the political upheaval in Kyrgyzstan over disputed parliamentary elections on 5 October, do not mean Russian influence in the region is on the wane. Rather, they manifest underlying instability in parts of the former Soviet space, due to unresolved political and territorial differences. The Russian-brokered Armenian-Azeri ceasefire agreement on 10 October has since broken down. In Kyrgystan, Moscow is cautious in approaching the dramatic power play where President Sooronbai Jeenbekov had resigned and his political rival, Sadyr Japarov, is now acting president after becoming appointed prime minister. President Vladimir Putin has avoided getting directly involved in the turmoil in the Kyrgyz republic. Russia\u2019s Balancing Strategy Russia has had good reasons not to portray itself as an overbearing factor in these countries\u2019 affairs though it is clear that only Moscow has the resources, political will and motivation to play the crucial role in any solution. President Putin\u2019s attention has been focussed on domestic socio-economic issues arising from the negative impact of COVID-19 on the economy and nearer home, the political trouble in Belarus. Relations with the European Union, principally Germany, have deteriorated further over the imposition of limited sanctions over the poisoning of Alexei Navalny. Moreover, the final stages of the US presidential election and latest polls indicating a possible Biden victory, occupy Putin\u2019s mind, given his admiration for President Donald Trump. Together with the US and France, Russia is a co-chair of the Minsk Group, which since 1994, has spearheaded international efforts to find a peaceful solution to the NK conflict. Russia has close but balanced relations with Armenia and Azerbaijan. While Armenia is a member of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) with a Russian military base on its territory, Russian obligations to Armenia\u2019s defence are confined to external attacks on its territory (NK is not internationally recognised as Armenian territory). Armenia is also a member of the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU); Russia is its major trade partner. Russia is reportedly not enamoured of the current Armenian government which it sees as having come to power as a consequence of street demonstrations against the previous government, said to have been friendlier to Moscow. Hence, it does not feel pressure to militarily support Armenia. Azerbaijan\u2019s military is stronger than Armenia\u2019s. With 10 million people and an energy- rich economy, it has the advantage over the smaller Armenia with its three million population. Russia neither wants a total Azeri victory nor an indisputable Armenian defeat. To balance them, Russia has been selling weapons to both sides. There is also a domestic dimension to Russia\u2019s calculations. There is a very large Azeri and Armenian diaspora in Russia (about two million for each community) and Moscow is keen on ensuring that the current conflict does not translate into instability between these communities on Russian soil. The Turkish Factor Turkey\u2019s support of Azerbaijan is of concern to Russia; it already has policy differences with Turkey over Syria and Libya. Since Azerbaijan is already close to Turkey, Russia does not wish to push it closer to Ankara by openly supporting Armenia. Russian concern about growing Turkish influence in Azerbaijan is also linked to a deep fear of the possible introduction of Syrian fighters aligned to Turkey into the Caucasus, where Russia is battling Chechens and other Muslim groups. Escalation of the conflict could also drag Russia into hostilities with Turkey. Russia would not want to upset its relations with Turkey. As pointed out by President Putin at the annual Valdai Discussion Club (VDC) in Moscow on 22 October, bilateral trade between the two countries exceeded US$20 billion, both sides implemented the TurkStream energy project and Turkey purchased Russia\u2019s S-400 missile system. It also stands to reason that Turkey\u2019s troubled relations with NATO are not necessarily disadvantageous to Russia\u2019s strategic interests. The Kyrgyz Front Russia has links with the opposing sides and does not want to appear favouring factions in the traditional north-south divide. Members of the Kyrgyz elite are invariably Russian-educated, retain strong links with and look to Russia more than any other power. While neighbouring China\u2019s economic influence is strong, anti-Chinese sentiments in Kyrgyzstan are rising and becoming harder to manage. Remittances from Kyrgyz migrant workers in Russia accounted for around a third of gross domestic product in 2018; while COVID-19 has led to many losing their jobs, Russia is likely to remain its main market for Kyrgyz labour; being a member of the EAEU, Kyrgyz workers do not require a work permit. Russia has also implemented projects valued at US$500 million. Kyrgyzstan is a CSTO member and hosts a major Russian air base. While Russia is concerned about the situation, direct Russian intervention is unlikely. There is no direct land access to Kyrgyzstan for Russia to project its military power rapidly and efficiently. Russia is also mindful of the probable negative Western reaction to any intervention and would not want to introduce an additional issue into its current tense relations with the West. Thirdly, no anti-Russian sentiments have been expressed by the competing factions in Kyrgyzstan. Finally, Russia did not directly intervene in the previous political upheavals in 2005 and 2010; there is no compelling reason for it to do so now. Avoiding EU and US Entry Given the protracted and highly emotional nature of the NK conflict and the role of Turkey, Russia has to move strategically. Moscow has no desire to let the EU and the US into this arena, and complicate Moscow\u2019s own balancing strategy. The ambitions of the Turkish president and his Azeri counterpart require careful handling as they could complicate Russian interests in the Middle East and the Black Sea/Caspian Sea region. It is also too early to ascertain whether and how Kyrgyzstan\u2019s political turmoil could end soon. However, the one constant factor is that without Russia\u2019s involvement or influence one way or the other, the chances of any solution to these unstable developments would be practically nil."

    "content": "SINGAPORE COMMEMORATES its 56 years of independence in 2021. As much as it is a time for celebration of strengths amidst the crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is also a time for reflection of the human spirit and to deliberate on the vision and aspiration for Singapore for the years ahead. President Halimah Yacob mooted the idea of the inaugural International Conference on Cohesive Societies (ICCS), convened in Singapore in June 2019. This timely Conference opened doors for inclusive thought-provoking conversations on critical issues of faith, identity and cohesion. A State of Being versus A State of Doing Countries aspire towards the broad ideal of cohesive societies. Cohesion is often reflected as a sense of solidarity and togetherness amongst members of the community. Social cohesion, an important facet of community resilience, is an ongoing process where communities collectively embrace a sense of belonging, advance the values of the community and guard against occurrences that may tear the fabric of community relations. More than \u2018a state of being\u2019 where communities arrive at the proverbial destination of cohesion, it can be perceived as \u2018a state of doing\u2019. This is often a long-drawn consistent work in progress. It is a process guided by a search for ways through which the community can continuously position itself to sustain and enhance levels of social cohesion. While it is no mean feat, on a positive note, most societies are not starting at a zero baseline of social cohesion. Studies have shown why social cohesiveness is integral. Socially cohesive societies are better poised for stability, growth and a general sense of satisfaction and trust in both inter-community and intra-community relations. It provides the scaffolding for a harmonious society. Finding Pathways to Higher Levels of Social Cohesion Recognising its importance, future-focused thinking, which combines scenario planning and decision analysis, will guide the process towards the desired outcome. Instances of casual racism and micro-aggression in society, point to the critical need for reflection on finding pathways for working together towards higher levels of social cohesion. It calls for honest, open and engaging conversations, reciprocity of respect and the creation of common space anchored on shared values. This ought to be done in a spirit of finding solutions while refraining from missteps of the past by avoiding the oft- mentioned \u201cdifficult and uncomfortable discussions\u201d. As communities develop, the \u2018toolkits\u2019 that have been used to educate on notions of social cohesion will also need to evolve. Discussions on social cohesion today will need to account for the ebbs and flows of concepts of faith and identity in modernity. Regardless of Faith and Identity Faith and identity are familiar and potent forces. They often channel an almost primordial reaction amongst groups to enact change for the sake of the greater good. History has constantly shown how these forces can both unite and divide. Inclusivity is the inevitable spearhead of efforts to foster social cohesion. In so doing, the first step will be the expansion of the parameters of the terminology. To broaden and open the avenues for discussion, unspoken assumptions on societal norms may need to be re-evaluated. The Singapore Census 2020 showed that 20 per cent of Singapore residents had no religious affiliation. Moving forward, discussions need to be expanded across the spectrum to include those without any religious affiliation with a view to furthering the goals of social cohesion. Singapore\u2019s economic success can lull pockets of the community into a sense of complacency. The absence of major disruption to society may well hide cracks and fissures. In attempting to identify shared values of social cohesiveness, a fundamental challenge may arise from groups that do not subscribe to the general mores and culture of cohesion \u2500 the so-called out-group. This refers to a group or community that an individual does not identify with and will perceive them as an outlier. Cohesion is A Choice While diversity in communities need not divide, the art of cohesion is borne out of a conscious choice. There is strength in diversity albeit not an inevitable outcome. The art lies in manifesting this strength in diversity to harness, nurture and to sustain cohesion. Honouring the legacy of our forefathers, cohesion is a choice; it embodies at its crux a commitment to common values. It is one where all sectors of the community have a part to play. In multi-religious, multi-racial and multi-cultural Singapore, the strength in diversity is seen in the art of progressing from tolerance to acceptance of the other. On a spectrum, tolerance is the lowest threshold of harmony. Acceptance is the higher ideal. It is a constant quest to climb the metaphorical ladder while helping those around to achieve a common vision of the desired future. The length of common and shared history does not instinctively make for a more socially cohesive community. The best possible outcome can be achieved when members of the community set up the necessary infrastructures to ensure that it can maximise the outcome of achieving a cohesive society. To achieve the desired cohesive future, the current generation of youth will also need to step up and play a part in all sectors of the community. The scale of success is dependent on choice. A choice the individual members of the community makes towards the greater goal of an inclusive and cohesive society."

    "author(s)": "By Lina Gong",
    "date": "No. 036 \u2013 11 March 2020",
    "content": "THE SEVERE shortage of critical medical supplies was a prominent challenge in the initial phase of China\u2019s domestic response to the COVID-19 outbreak. International humanitarian aid provided by foreign governments, international organisations, non- governmental organisations, the private sector and individuals have helped to narrow the gap. As the world responds by focusing on containment policies, epidemiological research and transmission of the virus, the ongoing fight against COVID-19 highlights the obvious vulnerability of critical medical supplies and the role humanitarian aid can play in enabling better national and global response. Severe Shortage and Consequences The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson appealed on 3 February 2020 that China urgently needed surgical masks, protective suits and safety goggles. Later, a Deputy Mayor of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, noted that there was a daily shortage of 56,000 N95 masks and 41,000 protective suits in the city. The scarcity of these items threatened China\u2019s response in several ways. First, it increased the risks facing frontline staff. The Chinese representative at the press conference of the WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19 on 24 February pointed out that over 3,000 health workers were infected, with the vast majority of cases in Wuhan. The need to hospitalise infected staff and quarantine the suspected ones aggravated the acute shortage of trained medical personnel and increased the already high level of stress of those still working in the hospitals. The inadequate supply of personal protective equipment and fatigue were likely contributing factors of infection among healthcare workers, according to the Chinese representative. Second, the inability to provide adequate protection for frontline staff erodes public confidence in the government\u2019s ability to tackle the epidemic successfully and thus undermines the efforts to contain the spread of the disease. In China, public concern over the safety of medical workers reached its peak as several medical professionals passed away in Wuhan within a few days in mid-February. The adverse consequences of the shortage in China highlights the significance of international aid in supporting countries in their fight against the disease, and doing so in a sustainable manner. International Donations to China The surge in foreign contributions since late January has alleviated the shortage of key medical items in China. According to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, as of 14 February, over 50 countries and five international organisations have offered or promised to offer assistance in this regard. Japan for instance was among the first countries that responded to China\u2019s need, offering medical supplies, funds and support in different forms. Iran donated over one million masks and other essential items, with the first batch arriving on 1 February. Singapore sent two batches of humanitarian aid which included three polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machines for screening COVID-19 patients and S$6 million in relief funds raised by the Singapore Red Cross, in addition to staple personal protective equipment items and sanitising and disinfecting agents. These have contributed meaningfully to China\u2019s existing efforts. Humanitarian Aid amid Pandemics The challenge facing China in the initial phase of its response shows that an unexpected outbreak of infectious disease can lead to humanitarian needs in a country that is believed to have a well-functioning health system. As such, it is necessary for the international community, particularly the humanitarian system, to reconsider its preparedness for and response to humanitarian needs in epidemics, if not pandemics. Because conflicts and extreme weather events have been seen as the primary causes of humanitarian emergencies, current humanitarian aid is geared towards such needs in these two settings, including medical supplies which primarily include essential and life-saving medicines as well as surgical and trauma kits. Even though infectious diseases are considered as a growing risk of humanitarian emergencies, the focus has been on helping countries that have weak health systems and poor water and sanitation and lack access to vaccinations. Conventional stocks of humanitarian aid as aforementioned are unable to meet the specific humanitarian needs in an outbreak due to the special characteristics of infectious diseases. For instance, in the case of COVID-19, not all types of masks but only surgical masks, N95 masks and the equivalent are effective for preventing the spread. The COVID-19 outbreak serves as a reminder for the international humanitarian community to review its inventory of aid so as to be better equipped for similar situations in the future. How Prepared is Our Humanitarian System? With WHO having recently raised the global risk of COVID-19 spread to the highest level, the question arises as to how prepared is the humanitarian system in responding to multiple emergencies at such a massive scale all at the same time. As more countries have seen a domestic outbreak, major donor countries may have to battle on two fronts, namely containing domestic outbreak and offering humanitarian aid to countries in need. China for instance dispatched medical experts and key medical supplies to Iran on 28 February, which was an early responder to China\u2019s need in late January. Moreover, the outbreak has significantly strained the supply chains of certain medical items and this has increased the difficulty to mobilise aid. As China is the primary manufacturer of many medical supplies, the shortage within China and the adverse impact of the containment policies on the Chinese economy has already disrupted the market. This is worsened by the possibility of some governments tightening or even banning exports of certain medical items to meet domestic needs. It is therefore necessary to diversify the sources of key items of humanitarian aid amid a possible outbreak of pandemics, or even beforehand. Facing the Future The COVID-19 outbreak highlights the importance to prepare for a scenario that a public health emergency of international concern first occurs in a low-risk country and subsequently affects global response to other parts of the world. In such a scenario, countries face a shortage of key medical items and global response is constrained as key donor countries are preoccupied with domestic outbreaks. To cope with such challenges, firstly, it is essential to strengthen preparedness at national and regional levels. Simulated exercises that involve governments, hospitals, the private sector and non-governmental organisations that play different roles in producing, mobilising, distributing and using key medical items are useful for preparing for future pandemics. Establishing and strengthening the infrastructure and networks for the storage and distribution of key items also contributes to more effective pandemic response. Secondly, an anticipatory approach is needed. Mechanisms that translate early warning signals to mobilisation of human resources and proper stockpiling of key medical items should be put in place at national and regional levels. Early deployment of needs assessment team to communities that face the risk of outbreak and are willing to accept aid can better inform humanitarian response to pandemics. Such expert teams can draw lessons from the work of the ASEAN Emergency Response and Assessment Teams in disaster management. Assessment results can facilitate timely adjustment of stockpiling of essential medicines, vaccines and medical equipment. In view of the growing connectivity and connectedness between countries, it is important that the international community and the humanitarian system plan and prepare for the future."

    "author(s)": "By Frederick Kliem",
    "date": "No. 002 \u2013 5 January 2021",
    "content": "HABEMUS PACTUM! The best news about the long elusive Brexit deal is that there finally is one. This alone is a big win for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who needed a political triumph. Although Brexit and the divorce agreement came at a high price, Brexiteers got most of what they wanted. It is surprising just how much Brussels was willing to accommodate British requests. Costly Triumph: Now For \u2018Mini-Brexits\u2019? Brexiteers above all wanted to pull Britain out of the European Union single-market and customs union; unimpeded national control over immigration; and independence from EU legal jurisdiction, standards and regulations. They generally achieved all that. A well documented and indeed obvious consequence of Brexit is reduced economic growth for Britons in 2021 outside the single-market. Yet, the UK-EU agreement provides for quota- and tariff-free market access, a relief for everyone bar the most hard-line Brexiteers. The economic impact will be theoretically cushioned \u2013 perhaps eventually offset \u2013 by a restructuring of British trade with new, independent trade agreements, which Britain can independently negotiate. London has already concluded 63 free trade (FTA) agreements, commenced official FTA negotiations with a further six countries, and are in ongoing talks with Australia, New Zealand and the United States. Granted, many of those FTAs are equal or similar to the EU ones; but it was less the content of FTAs that mattered to Brexiteers than the sovereignty to negotiate or change them independently. The same applies to EU standards, which the UK no longer has to accommodate beyond the threshold already in place. This certainly is a victory for Brexiteers, who de facto achieved what they had set out for. But Brexit came at a high price in form of a social levy, a demoralised society divided over Brexit, and now a British society perpetually stressed by a series of never- ending \u201cmini-Brexits\u201d. These mini-Brexits include numerous matters that have been either shelved for now or insufficiently addressed. Both result in continuous public and political debates, legal challenges and re-negotiations, internally and with the EU, with the consequence that Brexit is not done and never will be \u2013 with all the societal tensions that come with it. Mini-Brexit I: Devolution The Northern Ireland (NI) question seems insoluble for now. Accordingly, the agreement\u2019s compromise is unsatisfactory and ultimately unsustainable. In a necessary effort to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, NI will remain connected to the EU in manifold ways. Economically, Brexit has de facto created a UK-internal \u201csea-border\u201d with NI remaining within EU single-market and customs regulations, while the rest of the UK has left both. Socially, the Republic of Ireland (RI) has declared it will provide grants to NI students to continue participating in the EU\u2019s flagship student exchange programme Erasmus. Other UK students will, for now, not be able to benefit from this scheme anymore. The relatively stable status quo ante on the island of Ireland has been unsettled by Brexit, now connecting NI to RI, via Brussels. Likewise, the Scots \u2013 who overwhelmingly voted \u201cremain\u201d \u2013 go to the polls in 2021. Brexit will certainly be the main fault-line, and, while unlikely at this point, the spectre of Scottish independence will darken Britain\u2019s political climate for years to come. In combination, these double devolution issues severely complicate the \u201cUnited\u201d in the Kingdom. Mini-Brexit II: Fishing It is debatable whether there ever can be such a thing as a \u201csovereign coastal state\u201d, but exclusive rights to British fisheries is what the industry expected from Brexit. The eventual compromise achieved only a marginally greater share for British fishers, who are outraged and \u2013 correctly \u2013 feel that they have been sacrificed for other national priorities. Economically negligible as this is, fishing carries disproportionate political and emotional weight. A deeply disappointed industry will continuously lament the implementation of what they see as a sell-out Brexit. Because regulations will be re-negotiated annually after 2026, fishing will remain a perpetual issue, ensuring that Brexit will partly be fought again annually and not be forgotten anytime soon. Road Ahead: Not Done Yet While Brexiteers can claim victory from their perspective, Brexit is not done, and never will be. Two economies so deeply intertwined and geographically adjacent will perpetually struggle in arbitration courts over the true meaning of the Brexit agreement and the issues left unsolved. As far as the NI and fishing disputes are concerned, this perpetual struggle has been written into the agreement. In this light, it is difficult to see how Britain can ever return to a status quo ante \u2013 a time before the nationalistic, inflammatory, sometimes racist and xenophobic but at all times immensely divisive Brexit campaign created a societal discord that will be difficult to heal. What It Means for Asia For Asia, Brexit offers opportunities. We can expect increasing British interest in trade agreements as well as security cooperation. Several EU agreements, including with Singapore, have been rolled over, while others have been newly concluded or are being negotiated. A significant one is the UK-Japan agreement. Not only does it represent a notable trade success for London, Japan will also support potential UK attempts to join the CPTPP (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans Pacific Partnership) \u2013 one of the world\u2019s largest free trade areas, and to which the EU is not a member. Even if only to please the US, we can also expect an increased UK security presence in the Indo-Pacific. Next year, the new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, Britain\u2019s largest-ever warship, is expected to kick-off what is supposed to become \u201cGlobal Britain\u2019s\u201d increased Indo-Pacific focus. In addition to bolstering Asian recognition of its middle power status, London may expect a favourable US reception of its security contributions, which the EU cannot match, and which may allow London to jump the trade negotiations queue with the US. Such are the windows of opportunity opened up incidentally by Brexit. To some observers, Britain is returning to becoming the exceptional and ambitious island power; to others, this is na\u00efve sovereignty nostalgia. Few things in politics are ever one-dimensional. Brexit was always a double-edged sword, never entirely good or bad. 2021\u2019s divorce agreement cements this ambivalence."

    "author(s)": "By Alan Chong & Frederick Kliem",
    "date": "No. 199 \u2013 20 November 2020",
    "content": "EVER SINCE the German government\u2019s adoption of its \u2018Policy Guidelines for the Indo- Pacific\u2019 in September 2020, its defence minister, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, has been engaged in active diplomacy. She spoke first in a virtual bilateral forum with Australia\u2019s foreign minister in Canberra in early November, and then in another on 13 November with Singapore\u2019s defence minister. On paper, Germany comes across as an unlikely party to the debates over whether Indo-Pacific or Asia-Pacific regionalism should take precedence in military confidence- building, defence diplomacy, trade expansion, or diplomatic-community canvassing. Germany is regarded by most Indo-Pacific states as an economic heavyweight, but not as a geopolitical actor, and certainly not on the order of Australia, China, Japan or the United States. Militarily, it lags behind the British and French naval presence \u2500 in Asia and in general with limited naval capabilities. free Berlin\u2019s Two Flags But Berlin flies two flags, the national and the multilateral. As the largest member state and historically the most central state for European stability, Germany rightly sees itself as the champion and leader of European integration. In German strategic perspectives, unilateralism in international relations is no longer an option. For better or worse, Germany regards the entirety of its foreign and security policy as being anchored in NATO and the European Union. As a result, not only is Germany\u2019s Indo-Pacific entry a precursor for a greater EU and NATO role in the Indo-Pacific. It also fiercely advocates the strengthening of indigenous multilateral mechanisms. While Germany may appear patronising to some extent in certain ASEAN quarters, Berlin\u2019s strong support of the existing regional architecture is likely to be positively received in Southeast Asia. The nuancing of Germany\u2019s entry into the Indo-Pacific is music to ASEAN\u2019s diplomatic ears. It is perhaps no coincidence that Berlin\u2019s \u2018guidelines\u2019 describe something akin to an \u2018ASEAN Peace\u2019 dominating the Indo-Pacific, characterised mostly by domestic stability and almost non-existent interstate \u2018hot wars\u2019.

    "author(s)": "By Mely Caballero-Anthony",
    "date": "No. 060 \u2013 2 April 2020",
    "content": "PEOPLE AROUND the globe are waking up to a new reality of a world shutting down, as countries desperately try to contain the spread of this raging COVID-19 virus. In three months since the outbreak of this disease, people\u2019s lives have severely upended with cities locked down, millions of jobs gone, and thousands of lives lost. With no end in sight as to when the spread of the disease can be contained, countries are grappling to prevent the collapse of their national health systems and averting catastrophic consequences. With 170 countries already affected, the effects of closing national borders and stopping international and domestic travels point to a long-drawn- out global economic recession, signalling more pain and human suffering. Missed Opportunity? Against an apocalyptic scenario where humanity faces a singular existential threat to human and state security, it would need the collective will, effort and commitment of the whole international community to put their resources together and fight the disease. Sadly, this show of collective effort and solidarity have been slow in coming. The lack of a concerted global effort is significantly hampered by the inability of the two global powers, the United States and China, to work closely together and lead a coordinated and effective international response to contain and stop the pandemic. Much has already been said about the failure of governments to act swiftly to prepare against the pandemic. The World Health Organisation\u2019s Director General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, described the delay as a \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d given that there was a window of time during its first outbreak in China when other parts of the world could have prepared aggressively to respond when the COVID-19 reached their borders. Given the dire situation facing the global community today, there is clearly no point for recrimination nor dwell on the \u2018what-ifs\u2019. Instead, the impetus to push for a more concrete global action at multiple levels to fight the pandemic has become more urgent than ever. Notwithstanding US-China tensions, there are already several initiatives undertaken by a range of actors at different levels to respond and contain the spread of COVID- 19. Awareness of these emerging international efforts helps generate more support and allows for spawning more initiatives geared towards helping more countries and communities contain the disease. Strengthening Global Health Diplomacy The WHO, UN Foundation and the Swiss Philanthropy Foundation have launched the Solidarity Response Fund to help countries, particularly the less resourced and those with weak health systems to prepare and respond to the disease. These include improving detection capacity, providing protective equipment for medical workers, and helping scale up public health systems. In the race to find a vaccine for COVID-19, groups like the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI) are now spearheading efforts to finance and coordinate vaccine development with the University of Oxford and Novavax, a US- based biotechnology company. Meanwhile, the WHO has also launched its Global Solidarity Project that aims to start \u201cglobal megatrials\u201d of potential coronavirus therapies. A number of countries have already indicated their willingness to participate in these multi-country clinical trials including Thailand and Malaysia. Other private foundations like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Facebook have teamed up to donate US$25 million for more research on vaccines and other therapeutics. Most recently, amidst fears of prolonged recession, the G-20 countries have pledged US$5 trillion as economic stimulus to help restore global growth and provide market stability. G-20 trade ministers affirmed their commitment to trade and reduce risks to the global health supply chain. Can Asia Rise to the Challenge? While international efforts to raise financial resources and develop vaccines take time to materialise, there are things that Asia can do as part of the global efforts to fight COVID-19. Setting Standards and Norms in Pandemic Preparedness and Response Many medical experts and analysts are pointing to the way Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Vietnam have effectively responded to the COVID-19 outbreak. The speed, decisiveness and the extent to which their governments have gone to control the virus spread -- from strict restrictions on travel and movements of people, social distancing, massive testing and lockdown -- have gone a long way in \u201cflattening the curve\u201d of new infections. While lessons are being learnt, the measures adopted by these countries constitute the core set of norms in pandemic preparedness and response that the WHO and health officials worldwide have encouraged countries to adopt in their national pandemic preparedness plans (NPPs). Since 2003, when Asia had to deal with the SARS, H1N1 and MERs, the WHO had urged countries to review and strengthen their NPPs to prepare for the prospect of a pandemic of global proportions. A number of table-top exercises by health officials had also been held. Looking ahead, more of these kinds of exercises should be organised in the region to better institutionalise the best practices and norms of pandemic preparedness. Strengthening Regional Cooperation: Three Priorities Within ASEAN and ASEAN Plus Three frameworks, existing mechanisms among health officials and health ministers that promote cooperation in public health emergencies, such as regular technical updates and information exchange on pandemic response, can be developed further. This is to address three critical problems related to containment and mitigation of COVID-19 and future pandemics. First, is resource constraints. In the short-term, the leaders of ASEAN Plus Three should come together and work with their health officials and related agencies to craft a mechanism to build a regional stockpile of critical medical equipment for distribution to countries that are in dire need of items like PPEs, masks, gloves and even ventilators. Building a supply of anti-virals and vaccines (when available) as part of this regional stockpile should also be explored. The region already has logistical systems in place that can be used to help with the distribution of these items as and when they are needed. These include the Disaster Emergency Logistics Systems of ASEAN (DELSA) that store a number of relief items donated by countries like Japan, China and the European Union. DELSA can be readily mobilised and deployed in times of natural disasters through the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance (AHA) Centre. Second, is creating a pool of medical experts. Just as China and Cuba have started to send their doctors to beleaguered Italy to help, the idea of creating a pool of regional medical experts to help advise countries on containment and mitigation strategies should be considered. Third, given the likelihood that more pandemics can emerge, strengthening public awareness is another crucial agenda that the region should work together on. The media, civil society and local groups of communities across the region must be actively engaged as important partners in conveying the right messages to the public and fight \u2018fake\u2019 news. The COVID-19 pandemic is described arguably as a \u201conce in lifetime\u201d health threat. Asia should learn more and seize the opportunity to shape its role in global health diplomacy."

    "title": "ASEAN Outlook on Indo-Pacific: Seizing the Narrative?",
    "author(s)": "By Bhubhindar Singh and Henrick Z Tsjeng",
    "date": "No. 016 \u2013 23 January 2020",
    "content": "ONE OF the most important developments for ASEAN in 2019 was the adoption of the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP). At the 34th ASEAN Summit in Bangkok on 23 June 2019, the ten ASEAN members announced their vision of the Indo-Pacific in the form of a non-binding ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP). This document is a formal announcement of the incorporation of the \u201cIndo-Pacific\u201d into ASEAN\u2019s security discourse to exist alongside other geographical notions, such as East Asia and the Asia-Pacific, and to treat the Indian and Pacific Oceans as one strategic space. \u201cOld Wine in a New Bottle\u201d? The AOIP has been criticised for just being \u2018old wine in a new bottle\u2019, reflecting ASEAN\u2019s apparent inertia due to critical disagreements arising from intensifying great power rivalry. However, many such arguments tend to misunderstand how ASEAN, and by extension its documents, operate. On the contrary, the AOIP can instead be seen as a sign of ASEAN\u2019s determination to address the challenge posed by the Indo-Pacific Concept as it demonstrates ASEAN centrality in the face of mounting great power rivalry. As for most, if not all, ASEAN statements, the contents of the AOIP did not surprise anyone. It was cautious, muted and underwhelming, especially when juxtaposed with the worrying strategic uncertainty caused by the worsening US-China competition faced by ASEAN. The document focused on economics and development issues, and had little innovative contribution in mitigating the rising uncertainty in the strategic environment. Additionally, as an ASEAN document, the AOIP is non-binding, and merely posits lowest common denominator principles and ways forward. The Reality of ASEAN Of course, critics focusing on only these weaknesses simply assume that ASEAN as an organisation ought to always achieve its goals through decisive collective action. The reality is that the only way for that to happen is when all member states have similar national interests, values, and economic, social and political internal circumstances. ASEAN member states clearly do not have such similarities, and with ASEAN a consensus-based organisation, it is foolhardy to expect ASEAN member states to always be able to agree on the ways to move forward. Moreover, criticism positing that ASEAN tends to ignore its own agreements overlooks the typical way ASEAN conducts its affairs. ASEAN tends to conduct negotiations behind the scenes, often with a view to prevent acrimonious disagreements from being exposed. This is in line with previous ASEAN agreements, like the ASEAN Charter and the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, foundational pacts which set out ASEAN\u2019s cautious and neutral approach. Observers of ASEAN were fully aware that the AOIP was never going to be a bold statement. They are used to the cautious tone in most, if not all, ASEAN\u2019s statements. Such an approach has served as a means for ASEAN to underscore its preferred features of regional order and its role as a convening power for all states to come together to build stability. The AOIP was no exception. The document underscored these features, namely ASEAN centrality through ASEAN-led mechanisms, dialogue and cooperation to promote peaceful cooperation, a rule-based framework, and the pursuit of an open and inclusive regional order that does not close the door to any state. This enables ASEAN\u2019s normative structure to continue to guide the regional order, be it Indo-Pacific or East Asia or Asia-Pacific. Moreover, the AOIP expressed ASEAN neutrality, especially in terms of distancing itself from the US-China strategic competition and keeping out of any initiative that targets China, which other Indo- Pacific visions both either explicitly or implicitly do. ASEAN\u2019s Role in Emerging Indo-Pacific Order As such, the AOIP is arguably a relatively good beginning for ASEAN to define its role in the emerging Indo-Pacific order. Despite the expected disagreements between member states during the negotiation process, the final outcome displayed ASEAN\u2019s ability to come together to set the direction for a sub-regional institution in light of the rising uncertainty in the strategic environment. The AOIP made sure that ASEAN was not left out or ignored in the larger debate on the Indo-Pacific that has been mainly led by the great/major powers. In contrast, an inability to even issue any document \u2013 similar to the non-issuance of joint statements in previous ASEAN meetings in 2012 and 2015 \u2013 would be a clear signal of ASEAN\u2019s failure to come to a consensus on the Indo-Pacific Concept. The fact that the AOIP gained consensus from the ten ASEAN countries is an indication how important this development is for ASEAN. While the ensuing document may be a tame one positing lowest common denominator principles, it nonetheless demonstrates ASEAN\u2019s resolve to at least discuss and agree on baselines on how it should view the Indo-Pacific Concept. This is a positive, even if tentative, way forward. Future of ASEAN\u2019s Centrality in Indo-Pacific It is difficult to see whether the AOIP will translate into future success for ASEAN\u2019s relevance and centrality in the Indo-Pacific Concept. What is clear is that ASEAN does not intend to create new institutions defined by the Indo-Pacific geographical concept. It would prefer for the AOIP to co-exist within the current ASEAN-led normative and political order. What observers should look for is the guidance from Indonesia \u2013 the leader that introduced and pushed for the document to be accepted by all the ASEAN member states - along with Vietnam, the current Chair of ASEAN. Moreover, a bellwether of the AOIP\u2019s progress would be how ASEAN frames any issue regarding the AOIP, as well as the level of consultation between ASEAN and external countries. If ASEAN continues to guide the conversation on its role in the Indo-Pacific, ensuring that external countries do not overlook it, that will be a sign of things going well. Even so, closer study of such developments would be required, given ASEAN\u2019s tendency to engage and negotiate from behind the scenes. It is important that ASEAN maintains the momentum in contributing to the strategic discussions surrounding the emerging Indo-Pacific order. The focus on neutrality, inclusiveness and pragmatic cooperation is exactly what the region requires amidst the rising uncertainty of the US-China competition. This rivalry threatens to unravel the existing regional order and lead ASEAN states to face the dreaded outcome of having to choose sides."

    "author(s)": "By Yasmine Wong",
    "date": "No. 046 \u2013 23 March 2020",
    "content": "SINGAPORE\u2019S FIGHT against the spread of COVID-19 has drawn international commendation, resources and crisis communications, as well as carry out efficient detection and isolation of new cases. its capacity to manage reflecting Despite these best practices put in place by the government, public anxieties still displayed in widespread panic buying after the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) was raised to orange. Empty supermarket shelves in response to COVID-19 panic, however, are not unique to Singapore. Hong Kong, Japan, and more recently South Korea and Italy, among others, observed similar behaviours after experiencing spikes in infection cases. Global Trend Although this has calmed significantly over the past few weeks, public anxieties have persisted in other forms. A wave of anti-Chinese sentiments has swept the globe, from restaurants in South Korea turning away Chinese customers, to high schoolers in the United States physically assaulting an Asian-American teen, accusing him of carrying the virus. In London, a Singaporean student was assaulted by a group of young people in a COVID-19-related attack. In Singapore, a petition with over 100,000 signatures has made its rounds, calling for the ban of all travellers from China. In a Facebook post, a religious leader in Singapore remarked that the virus was \u201cretribution by Allah\u201d for China\u2019s oppression of Muslim Uighurs in the Xinjiang province. These events stand amidst a backdrop of xenophobic rumours, posts and comments on social media. Fear and blaming others are the usual reactions in a situation of helplessness and frustration. Witness the AIDS epidemic, the spread of Islamophobic sentiments after an extremist attack, and now Sinophobia in the wake of COVID-19. Experts classified this behaviour as \u201cothering\u201d and it serves to restore a sense of control in a crisis, especially when personal well-being is threatened and there seems no easy redress or solution. Xenophobic Discourse and Immigration However, anti-China sentiments observed in Singapore did not begin with the spread of COVID-19. Predating the COVID-19 crisis, xenophobia features heavily in the politics of immigration in Singapore. With the spread of COVID-19, xenophobic sentiments are now targeted towards the Mainland Chinese population in Singapore, emerging as Sinophobia, with some Singaporeans shunning Chinese businesses and people from China over COVID-19 fears. This is reminiscent of other cases of Sinophobia in Singapore like the Curry Dispute of 2011, in which an immigrant family from China complained about the smell of curry coming from their Singaporean Indian neighbour\u2019s home. This drew anti-China and anti-foreigner vitriol from netizens online who saw it as an attack on Singapore\u2019s multicultural identity. Other examples include rental discrimination, where rental advertisements reveal prejudice against certain groups of people, notably potential tenants from China, and Indians. Singapore brands itself as a cosmopolitan city with strong cultural sensibilities, engaging a top-down approach to managing inter-group relations. The discourse of racial harmony is salient in Singapore\u2019s public sphere and has become part of Singapore\u2019s shared values. This framework of diversity that has remained the focus of Singapore\u2019s brand of multiculturalism leaves out immigrants and migrants as groups whose relations with the rest of the populace need to be nurtured. Immigration & Integration When it comes to immigrants, social norms that prevent violation of sacred values like racial and religious harmony are less salient. Prominent immigrant groups like the Chinese, Filipinos and South Asians are often viewed as both a cultural and an economic threat to citizens, with overcrowding contributing to an overall sense of unease. The exclusionist stance remains the dominant narrative in conversations about foreigners. The Singapore government often justifies immigration by highlighting the economic value of immigrants and migrants. Emphasis is placed on the ability of migrants and immigrants to contribute to the country\u2019s economic development, as Singapore suffers strains on its manpower resource with declining birth rates and an ageing population. Despite the government\u2019s stance and continual efforts to remain attractive to immigration, its citizens are less convinced. These tensions culminated in a demonstration against the Population White Paper, a 2013 policy paper that projected the population to grow by 30% by 2030 with immigrants accounting for half that figure. Similar conversations remain active online, with sensationalised instances of foreigners behaving in an unsavoury manner stoking the flames of xenophobia. Furthermore, the narrative of immigrants having the responsibility to integrate with the rest of mainstream society trumps the celebration of the diversity that immigration brings. As such, when society casts doubt on the utility of the foreigner, and he is perceived to be the source of the problem, as with COVID-19, there is little left to defend him with. Managing Diversity Multiculturalism is the cornerstone of Singapore\u2019s identity. It is important for Singaporeans to understand diversity as a strength and to feel a sense of ownership toward pursuing a more inclusive model of multiculturalism that accounts for non- citizens and new citizens. The government has acknowledged the conundrum of immigration, and the importance in finding a balance between maintaining an openness to foreign workers to sustain economic growth and managing growing tensions between Singaporeans and immigrants. Expanding our understanding of social harmony and diversity will help Singapore deal with groups and issues that are yet to be part of the public discourse. This includes how we see foreigners, whether they are transient workers, new immigrants, or naturalised citizens. Beyond our leaders standing in solidarity with China over the COVID-19 crisis, it is heartening to see the production of counter-narratives that combat xenophobia. Singaporeans have taken to social media to denounce the xenophobic comments that have surfaced online and to show support for the residents of Wuhan. Ground-up initiatives to start conversations about xenophobia in Singapore indicate the community\u2019s grasp of Singapore\u2019s diversity and its dreams of a cosmopolitan future. During times of crises, such efforts reflect the strength of the community, that Singapore can be greater than the sum of its fears. With calls for discussions on immigration-related issues, community-generated narratives can serve as the foundation for constructive dialogue. It is also a progressive step toward generating new narratives about diversity that exceed race and religion, and to address the gap between immigration policies and public anxieties."

    "title": "Hagia Sophia: The Meaning of Ottoman Symbolism",
    "author(s)": "By Paul Hedges and Mohammed Gamal Abdelnour",
    "date": "No. 159 \u2013 19 August 2020",
    "content": "FOLLOWING THE decision on 10 July 2020 that reverted Hagia Sophia from a museum back to a mosque, after 85 years, it was reopened for Islamic prayer on 24 July. That day, Ali Erba\u015f, head the government\u2019s Turkish Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet), delivered a sermon from the mimbar holding an Ottoman sword. The symbolism of the act accompanying this sermon, or khutbah, has triggered discussion among both non-Muslims and Muslims. While Greek voices claim it revives a neo-Ottoman vision of a conquering power, Turkey's governmental voices defended it as a cultural manifestation of Turkish heritage and traditions. Ottoman Justification Justifying this act, Erbas told journalists: \u201cKhutbahs had been delivered with a sword, without interruption, for 481 years. If Allah permits, we will resume this tradition from now on.\u201d He linked this to Hagia Sophia being a mosque that emerged out of the conquest of Constantinople. However, appealing to tradition could be problematic. In many canonical hadith collections, such as by Sunnan Ibn Majah, it is narrated that the Prophet, even on the battlefield, would lean on a bow rather than a sword when giving a speech. Moreover, in delivering a khutbah, he leant on his staff. And in his Z\u0101d al-ma\u2018\u0101d, Ibn al-Qayyim (d. 1350 AD) attributed to ignorance the belief that Muhammad would lean on a sword, especially if this was linked to the contentious association of spreading Islam with the sword -- a misconception that modern Muslims have also been refuting, such as \u2018Abb\u0101s al-\u2018Aqq\u0101d in his \u1e24aq\u0101\u2019q al-isl\u0101m. Legal and Political Debates On the legal side, the primary debate concerned the question of whether the 1934 decision by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of post-Ottoman secular Turkey who turned Hagia Sophia from a mosque into a museum, was legitimate. This related to the Islamic charitable status (waqf) granted to Hagia Sophia by Sultan Mehmet II (known as Mehmet al-F\u0101ti\u1e25 \u201cThe Conqueror\u201d) when he converted it from a church to a mosque in 1453. Scholars point out that in Islamic ruling, once a property is declared a charitable trust, it gains an unalienable, perpetual status. If the granting of waqf is an inviolable act, then changing Hagia Sophia\u2019s mosque status to a museum would have been illegal. Here, religious claims compete with Turkey\u2019s secular laws amidst a situation which many have described as post-secularism. The sermon was seen by some as opposing Turkey\u2019s secular and multicultural status. While the decision to revert to its mosque status seems to fall within Turkey\u2019s own sovereignty, that Hagia Sophia is a UNESCO World Heritage Site meant wider consultation was needed. It also was a decision that has emotional and political ramifications beyond Turkey. While Erdogan needs to bolster support for his own brand of Islamist populism nationally, it also may be designed to help stake his claim as a global Muslim leader. Islamic Legacies Another talking point is whether this reversion is even justified under Islamic auspices. Mehmet\u2019s conversion of Hagia Sophia contrasted with the example set by Caliph Umar, a Companion of the Prophet, who consciously ensured that both the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem and the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem were not converted into mosques. Against this, citing medieval Islamic jurisprudence, for instance, al-Ba\u1e25r al-r\u0101\u02bciq, shar\u1e25 Kanz al-daq\u0101\u02bciq, some see the conversion of churches (and other buildings) into mosques as legitimate when territories were taken by force rather than having surrendered. Further, a number of Muslims today cite a hadith (Prophetic Tradition) as evidence that Hagia Sophia would fall to the Muslims. However, this hadith (along with a number of related ones) were traditionally seen as relating to the end times, as al-Suy\u016b\u1e6d\u012b reports in his al-Durr al-manth\u016br f\u012b'l-tafs\u012br bi'l-ma'th\u016br. Yet, at the time of the conquest, a hadith scholar al-Sa\u1e2b\u0101w\u012b (d. 1497), in his al-\u1e0caw' al-l\u0101mi` li-ahl al-qarn al-t\u0101si\u2018, which included a biography of Mehmet al-F\u0101ti\u1e25, never drew a correlation with such hadith traditions. Its modern usage seems indicative of a contemporary form of politicised Islamic thought. These arguments indicate differing ways Islamic identity is debated by Muslims today. For some Muslims, Islam is a religion of conquest that can rightfully usurp the property of other religious traditions in something of a zero-sum game. For other Muslims, a deeper kinship underlies the relationship with religions, especially those seen as People of the Book (\u2032ahl al-kit\u0101b), which goes back to Islam\u2019s roots. Ottoman History of Co-Existence A further discussion in this situation is not just the way Islam is envisaged, but also specifically how Turkish Islam is envisaged. This was clearly raised in the symbolism of Erba\u015f\u2019 sermon with a sword. While a motif of conquest is part of the Ottoman inheritance, many Muslims do not see this heritage as being antagonistic to other religions. Indeed, within Turkey, the Ottoman heritage is widely remembered as a time of coexistence and religious harmony, when Turkish Sultans ruled a multireligious empire without major incidents of strife. As such, reviving Ottoman-era notions may be seen as promoting greater interreligious bonhomie than is often found today. Such an image of the Ottoman\u2019s is not without justification. While Europe emerged from its so-called Wars of Religion in early modernity, many late 18th century intellectuals who advocated freedom of religion and toleration held the Ottoman Empire up as a model that contrasted well with Christendom\u2019s intolerance. Very often, when Jews fled Christian persecution they found a welcome home in Ottoman lands. Indeed, it was primarily as the Ottoman Empire collapsed and modern ideas of national identity took their place that we saw major incidents of religious violence, such as the so-called Armenian \u201cgenocide\u201d. Conflation of the Past, Present and Future Religious leaders, like politicians, often appeal to a memory of their past to justify actions in the present. Sometimes these religious and political memories overlap. Populism with appeals to a glorious past may often elicit a strong response. As such, both religious leaders and politicians need to be wary about what vision of the past they wish to invoke. Visions of the past can easily become dreams of the present and nightmares of the future. This is why building bridges among faiths is much needed."

    "title": "Responding to Streatham: Managing Low-Tech Terrorist Threat",
    "author(s)": "By Raffaello Pantucci",
    "date": "No. 024 \u2013 7 February 2020",
    "content": "ON 2 FEBRUARY 2020, the south London district of Streatham saw a knife-and-fake bomb attack in which a man was shot dead by police after stabbing two people. ISIS claim of responsibility has little credible evidence; despite the young man\u2019s reported pledge of allegiance to ISIS, there is no proof they were in contact. The attack, however, comes against a political context which will demand some reaction. The re-installed Tory government has now faced three incidents on its watch. The outward similarities in all three draws public attention. The United Kingdom fears that it could find itself in the midst of another 2017 when the country suffered five terrorist attacks in relatively quick succession. More Copycat Attacks? The most immediate concern for authorities will be the possibility of a copycat incident of some sort. The Streatham attack itself was already a copy. The knife-and-fake- bomb model is one that was deployed in 2017 on London Bridge, on London Bridge again in November 2019, and then in Her Majesty\u2019s Prison (HMP) Whitemoor in early January 2020 when a convicted terrorist offender and a prisonmate attacked prison guards with bladed weapons and fake suicide vests. Further emulation might be possible given the simplicity and relative success (in media terms) of the attack. The approach of using knife-and-fake-bomb is a new innovation that has been proven to deliver easy success. The Streatham attack showed how you could wait until the moment of attack to arm yourself, completely compressing the time to attack. It is hard to completely assess at this stage the exact nature of inspiration that the three plots played towards each other. But on the basis of previous chains it is likely that any subsequent spontaneous ones are likely to come sooner rather than later. More considered plots do not necessarily fall within this analytical framework. Undirected \u201cCampaign\u201d of Lone Actors At this stage, the Streatham attack appears as an isolated act. However, as 2017 showed in the UK, a terrorist campaign no longer needs to come in the form of a series of directed attacks; it can also happen to a series of incidents like this. Both Al Qaeda and ISIS have championed the lone actor model of attack repeatedly. Understanding how to analyse potential lone actors from a pool of potential offenders was a major question to emerge from 2017, and it will likely now be revisited again. It is worth noting that security authorities were very concerned about the Streatham attacker. The fact he was being monitored as he went about his Sunday business by an undercover armed response unit (armed response units are rare in the UK) shows a high level of risk management assessment. The high level of concern was visible earlier as well. The counter-terrorism lead at the time of his detention and the sentencing judge all publicly expressed concern about his level of radicalisation. Reporting from his time in prison has suggested that he refused engagement with de-radicalisation programmes. Offender Management in Prison A running theme between the London Bridge, HMP Whitemoor and Streatham incidents is prison. However, there are differences that are important to highlight. While the Streatham incident took place days after the offender\u2019s release, the London Bridge attacker waited over a year to launch his attack, for some part of which he engaged with a de-radicalisation programme. In contrast, the HMP Whitemoor offender still has a number of years on his sentence (a sentence which is likely now to become longer). It is therefore hard to judge where the useful comparison is to assess where the problems might lie. Recidivism is rare among UK terrorist offenders \u2013 prior to the London Bridge attack last year, no successful plots involving recidivists had been seen. While there is a cadre of radicalised individuals who consistently show up on charges for various related offences (often individuals drawn from the Al Muhajiroun community), actual attacks (or plots) by people previously convicted of terrorism offences is a relatively new innovation in the UK context. Prior to the current cluster, the UK had only seen two since the conflict in Syria started (out of around 40 or so plots that have been disrupted or taken place). Youth Radicalisation and Long-term Monitoring Another similarity between the three recent cases is the relative youth at the time of first offence of the three men. The Streatham attacker was 17 when he first came to authorities\u2019 attention, the London Bridge attacker\u2019s house was first raided by counter- terrorism authorities when he was 17 and the HMP Whitemoor offender was 18 when he was arrested on his way to launch a knife attack. Aside from what this means for radicalisation, it presents a long-term issue for authorities when it is considered alongside the fact that the UK has seen a terrorist attack by a 52-year-old (London Bridge, March 2017). Authorities may have decades of monitoring ahead of them with all of the expense and resource that entails. Beyond Deradicalisation Programmes the effectiveness of de-radicalisation to The attacks have drawn attention programmes. While the Streatham attacker refused to engage, the London Bridge attacker before him had been engaged for some time before stopping in the months prior to his attack. In other words, de-radicalisation programmes are not relevant across all of the cases and such dramatic failures are a new phenomenon in the UK. The UK has had almost two decades of Islamist terror offenders, but only recently are we seeing such attacks from amongst recidivists. At the same time, it is clear that this is where the current heart of the problem lies given the growing number of people coming out of prisons or back from Syria. This means more offenders (or people of concern) who will need attention for longer. The idea of using probation services better to manage such offenders is good, but this means probation needs a considerable uplift. Streatham is now the 11th known attack with Islamist links that the UK has seen since the Conservatives took power in 2010. While the nature of the threat has changed, it is not clear that all aspects of the response have kept up. Problematically, however, the current emanating from Whitehall suggests that the response is likely to focus on punitive measures pandering to a political base."

    "title": "Islamophobia & Antisemitism in SG: Narratives of Grievance",
    "author(s)": "By Luca Farrow",
    "date": "No. 057 \u2013 7 April 2021",
    "content": "IN THE first few months of 2021 news has broken in Singapore of a planned attack by a Protestant Christian on two mosques, and a planned attack by a Muslim on Jews at a synagogue. These planned attacks demonstrate that grievance narratives, even with very little apparent relevance to Singapore, can inspire violence in the Republic. In the first case, little information is publicly available but the 16-year-old plotter was allegedly inspired by Brenton Tarrant and his attack on mosques in Christchurch in 2019. The attacks were planned for 15 March 2021, the second anniversary of the Christchurch attacks. Like Tarrant, the Singaporean youth wrote an Islamophobic manifesto seeking to justify his attack on Muslims and in it he described Tarrant as a \u201csaint\u201d. Overseas Narratives and Local Impact Tarrant\u2019s overwhelming obsession, suggested by his own manifesto entitled The Great Replacement, was immigration and so-called \u201cwhite genocide\u201d, the theory of the displacement of white European people from Western countries. Notably, this concern would appear to have very little resonance in the context of Singapore and yet the young Singaporean seemingly found aspects of Tarrant\u2019s ideology and actions highly motivational. It goes to show how violent narratives and acts of terror overseas can have a local impact and why non-violent counter- narratives, and critical perspectives must circulate in Singapore, even about ostensibly foreign concerns. In the second case, there is again little publicly available information, but it seems Amirull bin Ali had become enraged at what he saw as the oppression of Palestinians by the Israeli government and in particular the killing of Palestinian civilians by the Israeli military, while Jewish people were prospering in Singapore. It would appear that in the mind of the would-be perpetrator, his anger could be legitimately channelled into the killing of three Jewish men worshipping at the synagogue, on the assumption that those males would have served compulsory national service in Israel. Compulsory national service in Israel applies to Israeli citizens, not to Jews of all nationalities and it is unclear whether Amirull had targeted specific individuals he knew to be Jewish Israeli citizens. Narratives of Grievance Like the case of the young Singaporean Protestant planning to attack mosques, the narrative inspiring Amirull\u2019s potential violence in Singapore has very little or no connection whatsoever to Singapore. Objectively speaking, Singapore is not embroiled in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and even if it were, it would make no sense for civilians to be targeted thousands of kilometres away in Singapore on the basis of their religion. These cases show Islamophobia and Antisemitism to be truly globalised prejudices, with the potential to lead into violence anywhere there are individuals steeped in these mindsets. As illustrated by these plots in Singapore, both Islamophobia and Antisemitism share key the phenomenon of human prejudice. features as merely different manifestations of In both cases, we see hatred of a \u201cbad\u201d out-group that is perceived to be thriving, typically via nefarious means and at the expense of a \u201cgood\u201d in-group, often conceived as the native population. Narratives of grievance are thus key to these prejudices. In the case of much of the Islamophobia afflicting Western countries, but also beyond the West in places such as India, where we see the idea of \u201clove jihad\u201d gaining such traction, Muslims are portrayed as a violent and unassimilable group unfairly growing in number at the expense of the \u201cnative\u201d population. In the case of Antisemitism across the globe, we encounter the narrative that Jews are unfairly prospering economically and conspiring to control the political system. A more recent but also very widespread feature of Antisemitism is the holding of any and all Jews responsible for the actions of the Israeli government. It should go without saying that to suggest Antisemitism and Islamophobia are fundamentally similar, is of course not to say that the experiences of Muslims and Jews across the world are fundamentally similar. That is a much more complicated picture. But in order to best guard against these prejudices, we must identify the similar patterns of meaning making among human beings that fuel hatred. How to Respond So, how should we respond to cases such as the two cited? Firstly, I would counter the objection many will surely make that no concerted effort should be made to respond to such cases and that to do so would be overly alarmist, given that these cases relate to two particular individuals who may not be at all reflective of the wider population in Singapore. It is true that we have limited information on the specifics of these cases and so we must be cautious about the lessons to learn, but I would argue that in general it is surely wrong to see persons who resort to violence as exceptional individuals necessarily suffering from some disorder. We are better off as a society understanding the kind of violent acts planned by the two individuals as existing on the extreme end of a spectrum of hatred. At the lower end of this spectrum of hatred we can situate such things as avoiding individuals deemed to be members of a particular undesirable group, making derogatory comments about entire groups of people, or de-prioritising them in job applications. At the upper end of the spectrum could be placed acts of physical violence and ultimately even killing. Islamophobia and Antisemitism thrive on the grievance narratives described above. These narratives, which can become widely-held stereotypes about Muslims and Jews, will have real world implications at some level. As scholar of prejudice theory Gordon Allport put it, \u201cIt is true that any negative attitude tends somehow, somewhere, to express itself in action\u201d. Critical Thinking and Countering Stereotypes To counter the spread of insidious narratives and stereotypes, which are sometimes very well entrenched within the community, everybody must be exposed to critical perspectives and counter-narratives that challenge overly simplistic negative beliefs about their deemed out-groups. We should emphasise the reality of variegated communities of people, for example some richer, some poorer, some more international in outlook, some more parochial, rather than monolithic blocs of \u201cJews\u201d or \u201cMuslims\u201d each made up of people sharing essentially the same characteristics. Ideally this would take place in the family home so that children are raised to resist black and white, us vs them thinking, and to reject racial and religious stereotypes. The reality is that not all families encourage embracing the other, and this is where schools and teachers are vital in imparting inclusive values. There is a role for the teaching of religious literacy and critical thinking skills to children and adults. It is not necessary that we each become an expert in every religion we encounter but we should have the knowledge and skills to readily debunk the negative stereotypes that we so often encounter. This is a long-term project that we must all be involved in, from the bottom up, not only to minimise the risk of terrorist attacks, but to build more harmonious and cohesive societies. It is a project that will come up against one of the worst aspects of human behaviour, the tendency to perpetuate stories to justify a preference for one\u2019s own group, but it is a vitally important one."

    "title": "Repatriating Militants: Indonesia\u2019s Dilemma & Its Consequences",
    "author(s)": "By Cameron Sumpter & Chaula R. Anindya",
    "date": "No. 029 \u2013 19 February 2020",
    "content": "RETURNING ISIS militants and supporters from Syria could represent a \u201cnew virus\u201d according to the Indonesian government, which has ruled out repatriating hundreds of its citizens who lived under their self-proclaimed caliphate in Syria. US intelligence figures suggest as many as 689 Indonesians are currently residing in three refugee camps in northern Syria, though only 228 have been formally identified by Indonesian authorities. The majority are thought to be women and children. While orphans may still be allowed to return, the fate of the rest is precarious. The decision appears popular among the voting public, but simply leaving them in desert camps with uncertain security among thousands of other ISIS supporters does not make the problem go away. Is the government kicking the can down the road? Politics, Security and Moral Obligations Indonesia is by no means the only nation dealing with this headache. Norway\u2019s ruling coalition government recently lost its majority when a right-wing partner pulled out following the repatriation of two suspected ISIS citizens. In the United Kingdom, the debate surrounding a so-called \u2018jihadi bride\u2019 from East London soon turned toxic amid the polarised Brexit turmoil. Russia brought home 26 children from Syrian camps earlier this month and plans to pick up dozens more, though Moscow has no intention of including adults. Kazakhstan has so far been the most ambitious, repatriating around 100 women and 400 children for \u2018humanitarian and moral\u2019 reasons. In early February, Indonesian President Joko Widodo said he personally thought the Indonesians in Syrian camps should stay put, but he sought further advice before making an official decision. Key guidance came from the executive board of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), who cited the Quran in arguing that the broader population\u2019s safety should be prioritised and people who travel for terror should not be allowed to return. The president has now referred to the camp residents as \u201cex-citizens\u201d and plans are afoot for an immigration list to permanently bar them entry from Indonesia, which will leave them stateless. Individual assessments may be made for some of the children, but only orphans under 10 years old. Who is a Child? It is clearly not easy to re-socialise a young person who has experienced the type of trauma the \u2018caliphate\u2019 no doubt provoked in heavy measure. But Indonesian law (35/2014) defines a child as under 18 years of age. Setting the threshold at 10 seems unreasonably harsh. Last month, the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria released a report reminding governments of their obligations to protect their nation\u2019s children, and called for the repatriation of minors along with their mothers for the best interest of each child. Few countries seem set to heed this advice, including Indonesia. Jakarta\u2019s uncompromising approach is intended to ensure the safety and security of Indonesians in the short to medium term. However, the decision is also likely informed by the government\u2019s messy attempts to reintegrate hundreds of Indonesian extremists deported by the Turkish government over the past two years. In early 2017, Indonesia\u2019s social affairs ministry found itself suddenly involved in the nation\u2019s counterterrorism efforts, when 226 deported ISIS supporters began turning up at two of its shelters in East Jakarta. The new residents were to undergo a one- month \u2018deradicalisation\u2019 programme before being sent back to their communities. Desperately unprepared social workers did their best to engage the reticent arrivals, who gradually started to open up following slow and steady trust-building efforts. Reintegrating the Reluctant Despite glimmers of optimism, one month is simply not enough time for a process of deradicalisation, nor for the more modest aim of \u2018disengagement\u2019, which focuses on incremental behavioural change rather than modifying convictions. At the end of the programme, some participants refused to sign a required document pledging loyalty to the Republic of Indonesia, though eventually agreed after being told it was their only way home. The social shelters were designed to accommodate juvenile delinquents and the victims of crime and trafficking. With no specific budget and considerable human resource shortfalls the initiative was never going to get very far with the deported extremists. A lack of transparency and coordination among stakeholders also hindered progress. Deportees who agreed to cooperate ultimately received an overwhelming amount of attention from organisations and agencies eager to demonstrate success. Accessible participants encountered a steady stream of practitioners offering similar programmes, which created confusion and sometimes a reluctance to continue engagement. Meanwhile, others who appeared cooperative at the shelter disappeared soon after leaving the facility. An extreme case was a couple who eventually made their way to the southern Philippines island of Jolo, and by early 2019 had conducted a suicide bombing attack which killed 22 people in a local cathedral. This tragedy may well have surfaced during the government\u2019s discussions about the fate of the hundreds of Indonesians currently in Syrian refugee camps. Yet it\u2019s hard to put much emphasis into the apparent failure of a \u2018de-radicalisation\u2019 programme when it barely existed in the first place. The Long Game of Prevention The current situation presents an opportunity to learn from recent experiences and develop a well-resourced, multi-stakeholder reintegration programme similar to efforts presently underway in Kazakhstan, whom experts are now describing as a global leader in this space for its humanitarian and moral rationale for the repatriation of women and children. It would be expensive and require far greater coordination \u2013 both among different government agencies, and between state and civil society organisations. The alternative will surely lead to greater problems down the road. ISIS has its origins in a prison camp the US military was operating in Iraq during the mid-2000s. Today we are facing a very similar situation in northern Syria, but one involving thousands of people from dozens of different nations. The Indonesian government may leave its citizens in these camps in Syria; but it must be prepared for their eventual contribution to the next iteration of the global jihadi movement, as well as the inspiration they will provide for the coming generation of militants back home."

    "author(s)": "By Walter Woon",
    "date": "No. 118 \u2013 11 June 2020",
    "content": "THE THUCYDIDES Trap is an intellectual trap for the unwary when uncritically applied to China. China is not a rising power; it is a returning power. The psychology is different. It is essential to recognise that America\u2019s \u2018adversary\u2019 is the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) led by the Communist Party of China (CCP), not \u2018the Chinese\u2019. The millions of people of Chinese descent in the world are not automatically aligned with the PRC. To refer to the \u2018Chinese\u2019 challenge is intellectually flabby and politically indefensible. Psychology of a Returning Power The psychology of a returning power is very different from that of a rising power. Imperial Germany at the beginning of the 20th century sought to elbow its way into the circle of great powers and seize its place in the sun. Ironically, German Chancellor Bernhard von B\u00fclow, who coined the phrase, was speaking of Germany\u2019s acquisition of territory in China. A newly-prosperous PRC demands to be respected, not lectured by those who oppressed it. Misapprehending the nature of the problem will exacerbate it. President Donald Trump wants a Confrontation with the PRC for domestic reasons. Trump said that the current COVID-19 outbreak is a worse attack on America than Pearl Harbour and 9/11. He has said before that trade wars are easy to win. Presumably, he thinks that a race and culture Confrontation will also be easy for America to win. But he underestimates the power of historical memory. The first time a foreign power complained about China\u2019s trade imbalance there was war. In 1839-42 Britain forced China to import opium to correct its trade surplus. China had to open up several ports to foreigners, who were exempt from Chinese laws \u2013 the first of the unequal treaties inflicted on China. After 100 Years: Its Significance 2019 marked the centenary of the Treaty of Versailles, as well as the May Fourth Movement. China sent over 100,000 workers to France during WWI, hoping to gain a place at the victors\u2019 table and rid itself of the unequal treaties. At Versailles, China was betrayed. The German concession in Shandong was handed over to the Japanese, instead of being given back to China. On May Fourth protests broke out all over China at this shabby treatment. Deputy National Security Advisor Matt Pottinger invoked the Movement in a speech seeking to undermine the CCP. This is ironic, since disenchantment with the Western democracies caused China to turn to autocratic countries like the Soviet Union and even defeated Germany for models. This led ultimately to the foundation of the CCP. The memory of racial injustice festers. The unequal treaties resulted in Western enclaves ruled by foreigners, where Chinese were treated as inferiors in their own country. A Japanese proposal for an article on racial equality in the Treaty of Versailles was rejected, by America among others. From Trade War to Culture War Now Trump is using this anti-\u2018China\u2019 feeling as a weapon in his re-election campaign. What better way to rally his base than by focusing attention on a foreign enemy, with a different skin-colour and culture? What started as a trade war is turning into a race and culture war. Using race as an electoral weapon is a tactic as indiscriminate as carpet bombing. Anyone who looks Chinese is an enemy. Korean-American actor John Cho wrote that east Asians now face rising racism in America. The organisation Act to Change noted that \u2018the COVID-19 pandemic has sparked rising numbers of anti-Asian hate crimes\u2019. Racism is driven by two contradictory impulses. Firstly, a sense of superiority. White Americans felt that other races were inferior, rejecting the racial equality clause at Versailles. It underpins the delusion that America is a shining light for the world. The obvious failures in coping with COVID-19 undermine America\u2019s claim to moral leadership. Blaming the PRC for the outbreak is the response, shifting culpability to a foreign foe. The second, contradictory, impulse is a sense of inferiority: that Americans cannot compete against the yellow hordes. This underpinned the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. The economic rise of the PRC again feeds this hysteria. The response is to accuse the \u2018Chinese\u2019 of unfair trading. Trump\u2019s trade war is a result of this insecurity. There is a crucial difference between relative and absolute decline. American economic dominance after 1945 is an aberration, largely the result of Europe\u2019s self- destruction in the Second Thirty Years War from 1914-45. US-China Confrontation: The Proxy Battleground For most of history China has been the largest economic power in the world. If the PRC grows economically the relative position of America will decline but this does not necessarily involve an absolute decline. The only way to prevent relative decline is to stop the PRC from progressing. This is not just unfeasible but downright immoral. The Confrontation will be played out in third countries. It is not a foregone conclusion that America will win this struggle for hearts and minds. The PRC has not tried to export revolution since the end of Maoism. It does not seek to change other countries in its own image. America does this constantly, preaching the superiority of its values; a claim that rings hollow given the poisonous partisanship of American politics. Moralising is all the more hypocritical when America is mired in a societal morass. Let those without sin cast the first stone; those who live in glass houses should be very careful about doing so. ASEAN countries are not naturally pro-PRC. Yet Asians also take pride in the achievements of a non-Caucasian power. When the PRC put its first Taikonaut in space the ASEAN ambassadors in Brussels congratulated the PRC ambassador. This was not just a matter of diplomatic niceties. Destroying an Empire: Which Empire? American bullying pushes positive attitudes towards negativity. The ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute asked which of the two rivals ASEAN should align itself with if forced to choose between the PRC and America. The vast majority preferred not to choose, but if forced a majority of people in seven out of ten countries picked China. Yet historical memory can be positive too. On 14 September 2001 over 200,000 Germans gathered before the Brandenburg Gate in solidarity with America after 9/11. The presentation of credentials for Ambassador Dan Coats was expedited so he could be there. Many remembered the \u2018Raisin Bombers\u2019 which were the lifeline of West Berlin during the Berlin Blockade. Generosity is what made America great, not \u2018America first and damn the rest of the world\u2019 selfishness. The PRC behaves badly in many ways, but confronting it directly will not improve matters. There will be a nationalist backlash, fuelled by the memory of historical oppression and racial prejudice. America can impede the PRC\u2019s progress but not stop it. A Confrontation will consume resources better utilised in making the lives of Americans better. America needs all the resources it can muster after the devastation of Trump\u2019s botched COVID-19 response. An American official said that America knows how to \u2018spend an adversary into oblivion\u2019. A story is told of Croesus, the last king of Lydia and renowned for his wealth. Croesus wanted to attack Persia. He consulted the Oracle at Delphi, which declared that \u2018if Croesus goes to war with Persia, he will destroy a great empire\u2019. Croesus confidently went to war and was soundly beaten. The great empire he destroyed was his own. Perhaps America might learn from history."

    "author(s)": "By Shashi Jayakumar and Manoj Harjani",
    "date": "No. 180 \u2013 16 October 2020",
    "content": "RECENT ANNOUNCEMENTS of Chinese tech giants Alibaba, ByteDance and Tencent investing in Singapore signal huge opportunities and potentially further cement Singapore\u2019s position as a hub where global flows of trade, investment, talent and data can interact productively in an enabling environment. The flurry of investment will inevitably \u2013 given growing discord between China and the United States \u2013 pose multifaceted challenges for Singapore\u2019s policymakers. American efforts to target China\u2019s tech companies have become one of the most visible aspects of a rapidly intensifying strategic rivalry, with a key thrust of the Trump administration\u2019s accusations against China being that its technology represents a national security threat. America\u2019s techno-nationalism The Trump administration has attempted to turn the screw in a variety of ways. Beyond attempting to force a sale of TikTok to an acceptable (read: American) entity, it has used Department of Commerce Entity List designations to limit export of American semiconductor technology that Chinese companies like Huawei \u2013 a lynchpin in the global rollout of 5G networks \u2013 are reliant on. Furthermore, the State Department\u2019s Clean Network initiative \u2013 which initially aimed to remove Chinese 5G technology from America\u2019s diplomatic communications systems \u2013 has since been expanded to cover mobile apps, app stores, cloud computing services, and even undersea cables. China has begun responding to what it sees as provocations in a like manner. It plans to launch its own Unreliable Entities List and recently updated its technology export controls, which now include artificial intelligence (AI). China\u2019s Foreign Ministry also announced the Global Initiative on Data Security, which comprises an eight-point proposal to develop international data governance rules. This must be construed as a response to the Clean Network initiative and builds on the notion of cyber sovereignty championed by China in recent years. The stage is clearly set for techno-nationalist lawfare, where legal tools become the means to achieve strategic ends. Beyond trade controls, investments are likely to remain in the crosshairs. The US has already strengthened its foreign investment screening mechanisms and has threatened to delist Chinese firms from American stock exchanges if they do not comply with US auditing requirements by the end of 2021. For its part, China will likely maintain or even expand its negative list which restricts foreign investments in selected sectors. China\u2019s Byte Some scrutiny of Chinese apps and technology is justified given Article 7 of China\u2019s National Intelligence Law, which compels compliance with requests from state intelligence agencies. Doubts over the independence of China\u2019s tech companies operating globally will also grow following the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) publishing the \u201cOpinion on Strengthening the United Front Work of the Private Economy in the New Era\u201d. The new guidelines aim to bring China\u2019s burgeoning private sector under tighter supervision of the CCP. Tech companies that could have eschewed direct links to the CCP and operated with some distance in the past may no longer have that option in future. This is added ammunition to sustain future American scrutiny and pressure on its allies and partners, which could extend to technologies such as AI and cloud computing. While Singapore and other Southeast Asian countries have prioritised pragmatism and commercial considerations over geopolitics (as in the case of 5G rollouts), this matters little if the American political calculus overrides rational consideration of actual security threats. The fact, for example, that TikTok user data is stored in Singapore may come under fire notwithstanding claims that this data is not subject to Chinese law, and despite respected independent commentators such as Ben Thompson observing, correctly, that \u201cfar more valuable data than anything TikTok could gather is trivially available to anyone, national security threat or not\u201d. The American point is a simple-sounding one \u2013 an expanded Chinese tech presence means a heightened risk of espionage. The outlines of a further argument are coming into focus too \u2013 that seemingly non-threatening apps such as TikTok hoover up information, leading to a situation where Beijing has a \u201cprofile of every American\u201d. Although there is no evidence of a systematic expansion of China\u2019s social credit system beyond its borders, there is concern, as CSIS\u2019 Jim Lewis observes, that the Chinese may in time extra-territorialise their surveillance state, leveraging on global deployments of surveillance technology by companies such as Hikvision. Outlook for Singapore America\u2019s attitude towards countries like Singapore, which have sought to remain neutral in the face of techno-nationalism, will likely evolve to further constrict space to manoeuvre. Besides official pronouncements, American officials and think-tankers have suggested on the conference and track 1.5 circuit that the US will necessarily have to recalibrate, and potentially rethink aspects of security cooperation and its relations with any country that welcomes Chinese technology in 5G or indeed any other area. The Trump administration also appears to see Southeast Asia as a staging area to face a more assertive China, and Singapore, as one of America\u2019s strongest security partners in the region, could increasingly be expected to function as a node in the pushback against China\u2019s technological expansion. Earlier this year, for example, Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs R. Clarke Cooper warned China over using Singapore\u2019s annual Air Show as \u201ca platform for exploitation and theft\u201d. Singapore has been on the radar before too. In 2018, the Trump administration intervened to block Broadcom \u2013 then a Singapore-headquartered semiconductor company \u2013 from acquiring the American wireless technology giant Qualcomm, citing national security concerns. The fear appears to have been that the sale would weaken American 5G development vis-\u00e0-vis China, which was not involved in the proposed sale. Such seemingly tenuous logic may in time be increasingly evident in other spheres. Current scrutiny over Beijing\u2019s Thousand Talents programme is a case in point, and may expand to other countries hosting large numbers of Chinese academics. Oversight and Risk Interagency mechanisms that could address these issues, such as the National Security Coordinating Committee and Security Policy Review Committee, already exist in Singapore. These can examine potential threats \u2013 from any country \u2013 to Singapore\u2019s critical information and digital infrastructure and act as decision-making platforms. Necessarily, and unlike the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US \u2013 whose decisions are dissected somewhat openly \u2013 discussion in Singapore has traditionally occurred behind closed doors. Policymakers will need to be clear about what the \u201cthreat\u201d really is. Beyond security assessments of the technical variety, the long-term implications of foreign technology being embedded in Singapore\u2019s socio-political fabric merit closer examination. If technology from any country is deeply embedded and has a persistent slant, there may be socio-cultural ramifications, the long-terms effects of which are difficult to gauge at present. Should policymakers dismiss the risk, society may over the long-term be shaped by repeated application of messages that are near-subliminal. This may lead to the balkanisation of thinking across different groups who are exposed to particular media. What all stakeholders (and these should include those concerned with Singapore\u2019s culture and society) actually need, therefore, is an expanded conception of national security, and innovative, holistic ways of assessing new risks."

    "author(s)": "By Nodirbek Soliev",
    "date": "No. 037 \u2013 12 March 2020",
    "content": "A NUMBER of Indonesian non-governmental charity organisations have undertaken philanthropic campaigns in support of suffering Syrian civilians. While most charities pursue a legitimate purpose, one such fundraising group, the Abu Ahmed Foundation (AAF), has prioritised supporting the jihadist cause in Syria. As part of these efforts, AAF has developed close ties with various Al Qaeda-linked militant groups on the Syrian battlefield, including the ones from China\u2019s Xinjiang province and Central Asia. This connectivity is significant for Southeast Asia in particular given the previous involvement of Uyghur militants in attack networks in Thailand and Indonesia. As we continue to see an exodus of foreign fighters off the Syrian battlefield, close attention should be paid to this vector as a possible source of future risks. What is Abu Ahmed Foundation? AAF is an Indonesia-based jihadist-aligned fundraising group founded and led by Tasniem, or Ummy Jibi, a widow of Indonesian fighter Abu Ahmed al-Indunisy, who was killed in 2015 fighting alongside the Al Qaeda-linked Hay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). An HTS-affiliated online user claimed that Tasniem is currently based in Syria, from where she might be coordinating the group\u2019s activities. AAF\u2019s existence became more prominent towards the end of 2018 when the group started to publicise its activities through various social media platforms, including Facebook, Telegram, Instagram and Twitter. AAF\u2019s online propaganda suggests that various local pro-Al Qaeda factions in Indonesia have promoted it, especially in the city of Cirebon in West Java, where most group members operate from. One of the key leaders of the pro-Al Qaeda Jamaah Ansharusy Syariah (JAS) group, Agung Nur Alam, alias Abu Usamah Nur Irhab, has often been invited to participate in AAF\u2019s grassroots preaching sessions. In such gatherings, Agung was usually seen carrying the AAF flag, showing his support to the group. JAS is a splinter faction of Jamaah Ansharut Tauhid (JAT), the successor entity to Jemaah Islamiyah (JI). Supporting the \u2018Caliphate\u2019 AAF engages in activities that pursue a mixture of humanitarian relief and jihadist- supporting goals, calling on people to support \u201cdestitute and oppressed Muslims\u201d in Syria, Palestine, Xinjiang and Burma, amongst others. AAF claims that HTS has established a \u201crightful Islamic state in Syria\u201d and it is now imperative for all Muslims to do their bit. In spite of its growing commitment to the Syrian jihad, AAF has so far presented itself as a non-violent group by abstaining from getting directly involved in any militant operations both in Indonesia and Syria. Like many other Indonesian charities, group members collect donations on the streets, at mosques and preaching seminars. In the online domain, AAF usually circulates its fundraising appeals in the form of posters that contain bank account details, contact number and name of recipients of the funds. AAF\u2019s propaganda videos and photos show that in Syria the group retains a team of volunteers assigned to deliver aid supplies primarily in the northern provinces of Idlib and Latakia. While a portion of the funds is used for social work such as the delivery of food and clothing for civilians, a significant amount is consistently diverted to jihadist groups fighting to keep HTS\u2019 \u201ccaliphate\u201d alive. The Uyghur/Central Asian Link Uyghur and Central Asian foreign fighters are among the top recipients of the logistical and financial resources that AAF has delivered to the groups under HTS\u2019 umbrella. The group has been developing close links with the Turkistan Islamic Party (TIP), Malhama Tactical and Kazakh fighters in particular. AAF\u2019s narratives regularly cite the Uyghur \u201coppression\u201d in Xinjiang and are emphatically critical of China. Such narratives are particularly valuable to the group as the Uyghur cause is very popular amongst the jihadist and broader community. AAF views TIP as the mujahideen force standing up for the \u201cprotection of defenceless Muslims\u201d both in Xinjiang and Syria. The group has also launched targeted fundraising drives for Uyghur fighters and their families in Syria. AAF has also been closely working with Malhama Tactical (MT), a private jihadist mercenary group, which serves as a special tactical training wing of HTS. MT was established in 2016 by Abu Rofik, an ex-Russian special air forces soldier born in Kyrgyzstan. Since October 2018, AAF announced several rounds of online fundraising campaigns for MT, when the latter was \u201cin need of help\u201d to purchase airsoft rifles and to build a new training camp where \u201cthe muhajireen undergo their special training\u201d. In a video statement released September 2019 on Twitter, \u201cAli Shishani\u201d, MT\u2019s new leader from Russia, claimed to have received donations from AAF and also expressed gratitude to the foundation. Later, in November 2019, AAF members were seen visiting and having dinner with the Kazakh fighters \u201cperforming ribat (frontline guard) duties\u201d in Syria. Implications for Southeast Asia While bound by aid in Syria at the moment, these groups may shift their attention in a more operational direction in the future. There is a possibility of AAF becoming a new connecting point between the battlefield in Syria (and Al-Qaeda linked factions in particular) and conflicts in Southeast Asia. Some Uyghur fighters and even Central Asians who wish to leave the battlefield may use AAF\u2019s local connections to relocate to Southeast Asia. In such a scenario, battle-hardened Uyghur returnees (or Central Asians) may form alliances with Southeast Asian groups. The involvement of Uyghur militants in the Erawan Shrine bombing in Thailand in August 2015, their networking with the Mujahidin Indonesia Timur (MIT) in Sulawesi and separately with the Batam-based cell known as Katibah GR in 2014-2016 to plot attacks had tangible security implications for the region. Finally, the link between AAF and the battlefield in Syria (and in particular the Central Asian fighters) might help transform elements of the organisation into an additional security risk to Southeast Asia. While it is a charitable organisation principally now, time alongside militant groups and an increasingly hopeless situation on the ground in Syria might further radicalise elements of the group to violence."

    "title": "Philippines-US Alliance Under Duterte: Unravelling?",
    "author(s)": "By Aaron Jed Rabena",
    "date": "No. 025 \u2013 11 February 2020",
    "content": "IN JANUARY 2020, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte ordered the termination process of the longstanding Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) with its lone security ally, the United States. The move rekindled anti-US sentiments and stoked widespread disapproval from the general public, including pro-US quarters in the country. According to the Duterte government, the reason for the VFA abrogation is the lack of respect for Philippine sovereignty or the \u201caccumulation of a series of disrespectful acts\u201d committed by some American senators against the Philippine government and its officials. US Action on Human Rights Apparently, this latest outburst from Duterte was triggered by calls by a number of US Senators to release the detained staunch Duterte critic Senator Leila de Lima and the revocation of the US visa of one of Duterte\u2019s strongest political allies, Senator Ronald \u201cBato\u201d dela Rosa, who was the former head of the Philippine National Police (PNP) and chief implementor of Duterte\u2019s controversial war on drugs. The cancellation of dela Rosa\u2019s visa comes on the heels of President Donald Trump\u2019s approval of the 2020 appropriations bill which included a rider provision, endorsed by certain US senators (Senate Resolution 142) invoking the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act. The Act authorises the imposition of sanctions on government and security officials \u2500 through travel restrictions and bank account freezes \u2500 who have committed human rights abuses or extra-judicial killings. Foundation of the Alliance Philippines-US alliance is anchored on three major documents: the 1951 Mutual Defence Treaty (MDT), the 1998 VFA, and the 2014 Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement (EDCA). The MDT is the mother agreement that outlines the legal foundation, framework and general purpose of the alliance. Like the MDT, the VFA is a treaty that was ratified by the Philippine Senate which sets out the terms and conditions on the entry and visit of US military personnel in the Philippines. The VFA was initiated following three significant developments: China\u2019s incursions into Philippine maritime waters in 1994 known as the Mischief Reef Incident; the expiration of the 1947 Military Bases Agreement (MBA) in 1991; and the refusal of the Philippine Senate to extend basing agreements by virtue of the RP-US Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Peace. The VFA was to re-accommodate American military presence without violating the prohibition on military bases stated in the 1987 Philippine Constitution. Additionally, the VFA provides a platform for annual joint military exercises (e.g., Balikatan, PHIBLEX) designed for improving combined planning and combat interoperability, and bilateral defence activities geared toward national security operations other than war such as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR), as demonstrated during Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) in 2013. Article IX of the VFA provides that termination process may be commenced after a notice of termination has been served by one party to the other. In fact, the same procedure holds true with respect to the MDT. However, terminating the VFA might have accompanying legal consequences for EDCA because the Philippine Supreme Court held in 2016 that EDCA is an implementing agreement of the VFA. Impact on the Alliance The EDCA is an Executive Agreement like the 1947 Mutual Assistance Agreement and 2002 Mutual Logistics Support Agreement (MLSA) that need not have Senate concurrence. It enables the increased rotational access of US troops and military assets to Philippine military bases and deepens the mechanisms and modes of cooperation (long-term capacity-building/modernisation, trainings, military assistance) between the Philippines and the US. The US is also allowed to build or upgrade structures, preposition weapons, defence equipment and materiel on mutually agreed locations (e.g., Cesar Basa Air Base in Pampanga, Benito Ebuen Air Base in Cebu and Antonio Bautista Air Base in Palawan), for a period of 10 years. intelligence, surveillance, US presence was evidently valuable reconnaissance (ISR) support during the 2017 Marawi Siege or armed conflict with Islamist militant fighters in Southern Philippines. in providing In view of these, should the VFA cease to operate, the scale, scope and regularity of American military presence and operations in the Philippines may likely be diminished or suspended as in the case of the Bilateral Air Contingent Exercise-Philippines. Capacity-building, just as with the US\u2019 security partners such as India, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam, may still push through via the Foreign Military Financing (FMF)/Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and professional exchanges. These professional exchanges consist of International Military Education and Training (IMET) and bilateral visits. Philippine Perceptions of Alliance The termination of the VFA will not spell the end of the Philippines-US alliance which is legally contingent upon the umbrella bilateral defence pact, the MDT. Still, the termination of the VFA would have fallouts for Philippine national security and Philippines-US bilateral relations, with possible implications for the wider security of the Southeast Asian region. While the VFA and EDCA have been useful in meeting Philippine security requirements, particularly conventional warfare preparations and non-traditional security contingencies, they, however, have not been substantially effective in deterring China\u2019s \u2018gray zone tactics\u2019 such as the 2012 Scarborough Shoal Standoff and island reclamation operations in the South China Sea. Against this backdrop, the call by the Duterte government last year to review the MDT or the broader Philippines-US security relationship has basis. Moreover, the cancellation of dela Rosa\u2019s visa coincides with the US\u2019 invitation for Duterte to attend the Special US-ASEAN Summit in March. This could mean two things: First, Washington is striking a balance between the need to maintain a robust Philippines-US alliance by having a workable relationship with Duterte; and the need to act on US domestic imperatives by exercising diplomatic sanctions. Seemingly, the alleged \u201csanction\u201d on dela Rosa cannot be said to be a sanction on the Duterte government because dela Rosa is already a senator who belongs to a separate branch of government. Can the Alliance be Foregone? In any case, it is important to note that when the Philippines refused to extend the period for US military bases in 1991 and withdrew from the Coalition of the Willing in the Second Gulf War in 2004, there was a marked decline in military education and training under IMET as well as foreign aid from the US. On the part of the US, a downscaled alliance with the Philippines could impact its regional leadership, strategic force posture and access locations for logistical support under the Indo-Pacific strategy. In this context, it is worth pointing out Vietnam\u2019s experience. While in the process of cultivating security ties with US and other strategic partners, Vietnam has thus far been able to safeguard its core interests vis-a-vis China without an alliance. Overall, the issue of terminating the VFA highlights two key points about the Philippines-US alliance: first, the advantages and disadvantages of the VFA and EDCA and their need for improvement; and second, Philippine security dependence on the US."

    "content": "INDIA\u2019S IMPROVING relations with Southeast Asia over the past two years are especially apparent in Delhi\u2019s growing military interactions with countries in Southeast Asia, specifically in the maritime realm. Southeast Asian countries have of late been encouraging India to play a larger role in East Asia, with certain regional states expressing impatience with the perceived slow pace of India\u2019s \u2018integration\u2019 economically and geo-politically with East Asia. Against this backdrop, India and Southeast Asia are increasingly diverging on the shape and contour of the emerging regional security architecture. This is reflected in the region-wide debate on the concept of the Indo-Pacific. Indo-Pacific: Contiguous or Interconnected? While there are contesting visions (and strategic geographies) of the Indo-Pacific, there is broad acknowledgment that India is a key part of the region. As the Indo- Pacific came to be infused with specific meaning(s) by Japan and the United States via the \u2018Free and Open Indo-Pacific\u2019 and the \u2018Indo-Pacific Strategy\u2019, countries in Southeast Asia felt increasingly concerned about being sidelined in shaping the narrative on the emerging regional security architecture. Despite a diversity of positions among Southeast Asian states on the idea of the Indo- Pacific, ASEAN decided in 2019 to issue its Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP). The AOIP considers \u2018the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean regions, not as contiguous territorial spaces but as a closely integrated and interconnected region, with ASEAN playing a central and strategic role\u2019. This is in stark contrast to the Indian view of the Indo-Pacific, which considers the whole of the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean as a single strategic space, replacing the Asia-Pacific. This is not mere semantics. The Indo-Pacific, as a single strategic space, aims to have various countries jointly constrain China\u2019s growing military, economic and political influence over this single contiguous space. The Quadrilateral Security Initiative (Quad) is one (and the most prominent) embodiment of this broad strategic goal. It differs significantly from the ASEAN-led, \u2018Asia-Pacific Way\u2019, which represents a more complex mix of hedging and balancing strategies against China\u2019s influence while simultaneously engaging it within various Asia-Pacific institutions and processes. There is a distinct sense that after more than two decades of increased integration with the ASEAN-led, \u2018Asia-Pacific Way\u2019, India seems to have lost confidence in the ability of this regional order to realistically curtail China\u2019s behaviour. The \u2018Indo-Pacific Way\u2019, with the US, Japan and (to a lesser extent) Australia, seems to India the more effective approach to negotiating China\u2019s rise. Southeast Asian states view such increasingly direct containment of China as raising the prospects of an escalating great power conflict in East Asia. However as India\u2019s bilateral relationship with China deteriorates, especially when it concerns border clashes with China, India seems more convinced about the \u2018Indo-Pacific Way\u2019. Delhi sees it as an apt strategy to replace the \u2018Asia-Pacific Way\u2019 in dealing with China. On the key issue of (re)constructing a regional order to deal with China\u2019s rise, India and Southeast Asia seem to be moving in different directions. RCEP: India\u2019s Shifting Mood? The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) is a regional free trade agreement that arose out of the 2011 ASEAN Summit in Bali. It envisaged a trading bloc which included countries from within East Asia (ASEAN member states together with China, Japan and South Korea) plus India, New Zealand and Australia. After several years of negotiations, in late 2019, India decided it could not join the RCEP. This was a blow to several other countries involved in the negotiations, especially Japan and Singapore, while leaving the option for India to join at a later date. The remaining 15 countries signed the agreement in late 2020. India\u2019s decision to not join RCEP is viewed as a major setback for the trajectory of India\u2019s integration into the ASEAN-led multilateral order in East Asia. The RCEP was envisaged as a key accomplishment for ASEAN\u2019s project in building a web of diplomatic, military and economic institutions and processes in East Asia, which would mitigate the prospect of escalating conflict in a region undergoing strategic re-adjustment. It is apparent that Indian leaders understood the strategic significance of the RCEP as well as the potential strategic costs of opting out of the agreement. However, domestic pressures informed largely by the prospect of an even larger trade deficit with China under the RCEP prevailed over broader strategic considerations. India\u2019s early \u2018Look East\u2019 Policy was informed to a significant extent by the need to benefit from greater economic synergy with East Asian economies; but there are signs that more recently, the mood within Delhi towards trade liberalisation has shifted. A More Insular India Emerging? The earlier \u2018Make in India\u2019 initiative and the more recent \u2018Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan\u2019 (loosely translated as \u2018Self-Reliant India\u2019) campaign are indicators of this changed mood within Delhi. Within official circles in India, there is a sense that India has not made the net gains it expected from its various free trade agreements it signed since the 1990\u2019s. Officially, both the current signatories to the RCEP and India have not discounted the possibility of India joining at a later date but most officials in Southeast Asia are pessimistic about this possibility. The two key issues \u2013 the idea of Indo-Pacific and RCEP \u2013 point to a key source of increasing difference between India and Southeast Asia. This is about how to deal with China\u2019s rising political, military and economic power and influence. The recent agreement between India and China to pull their troops back along their disputed border has potentially important implications for India\u2019s relationship with Southeast Asia. Speculation amongst many defence analysts is that India will have little choice but to augment its armed presence across the long border with China to prevent future incursions into Indian territory. Many suspect that the funds for a larger presence at the border will mean cuts to the Indian navy. India might once again be forced to turn its attention towards its land borders rather than continue its more recent re-orientation towards its maritime domain. This might signal a more insular India, with reduced naval capacity to play a larger role in East Asia and even the wider Indian Ocean. This might also portend an even further drift between India and Southeast Asia in the near future."

    "title": "The Case of Imran Kassim: What Does It Tell Us?",
    "author(s)": "By Amalina Abdul Nasir and Ahmad Helmi Hasbi",
    "date": "No. 017 \u2013 24 January 2020",
    "content": "IN 2002, Singapore\u2019s legal books introduced the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act or TSOFA. Imran Kassim was the first individual charged under TSOFA in Singapore, and the second to be convicted under the law. Ahmed Hussein Abdul Kadir Sheikh Uduman was the first man to be convicted for terrorism financing in October 2019 in close court. Imran\u2019s case was the first trial of its kind to be held in an open court. His rejection of Singapore law during the trial has caught public attention, with questions subsequently emerging on what can be done to further curb such extremist views to protect harmony in Singapore\u2019s multi-racial and religious setting. Imran Kassim\u2019s Rejection of Singapore Law Radicals arrested under the Internal Security Act (ISA) have shown support for Islamic State (IS) by harbouring intentions to travel to Syria to fight in the so-called jihad there, propagating IS\u2019 materials online, and gathering support online for the terrorist group. As Imran and Ahmed\u2019s cases have illustrated, providing monetary assistance has become another means of showing pro-IS support. Imran channelled S$450 overseas for the publication of IS propaganda. He had erased all possible traces of his communication and evidence of the money transfer to evade detection from local authorities. During his trial, Imran explicitly made clear his non-recognition of Singapore law, and the primacy of Syariah (Islamic) law in guiding his actions. Imran has now been convicted and will spend 33 months in jail. Managing Muslim Identity in Today\u2019s Cosmopolitan World According to Islamic tradition, Imran\u2019s assertion to only recognise Syariah law is flawed. Rejection of other forms of law and systems is heavily propagated by IS. This binary vision reduces the world to a black-and-white or \u2018us-versus-them\u2019 landscape; it is based on a heavily distorted version of Muslims being under Syariah rule. Such extremist thinking rejects other important Islamic perspectives, where Islam enjoins its adherents to embrace diversity. Historical empirical evidence shows that Muslims have had no problem living under non-Muslim rule. For instance, during the early period of Islam, many companions of the Prophet resided in Abyssinia, under the rule of a Christian king. It was an act which informed generations of jurisprudential specialists on the legality of Muslims to live in non- Muslim societies. In another example, 9th century scholars like Al-Shafi'i (d.820) permitted Muslims to reside under the administration of a non-Muslim. Minimally, Muslims must be able to manifest their wajibat-al-din (duties of religion) which is commonly known as acts of private worship such as the daily prayer and fasting in the month of Ramadan. Another consideration was the principle of peace (aman) in the host country. To that end, most jurists within classical Islamic thought agree that Muslims must abide by the law of the host country on the principle of aman. Extremists like Imran reject man-made laws and consider them as concepts adopted from the West. Such opinions exhibit a feeble understanding of Islamic thought. Modern-day, respected jurists like Pakistani Mahmood Ghazi contend that as long as \u201cman-made\u201d laws establish justice and human rights, they can be regarded as Islamic. Counter-Ideology: Efforts on The Ground In Singapore, various alternative and counter-narrative initiatives have been taking place to reach every level of the community. Weekly Friday sermons prepared by the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) often touch on related themes such as \u201cthe need to contextualise the religion in today\u2019s modern world\u201d. Education and outreach programmes such as the \u201cBeing a Muslim in Singapore\u201d series are organised by local mosques. This series aims to equip Muslims with the religious understanding of how to live in a secular state without compromising the principles of Islam. The Religious Rehabilitation Group (RRG), which is involved in the religious counselling of detainees, also launched the Awareness Programme for Youths in 2018, which focuses on the practice of Islam in a plural society. The community is also seeing a rise in alternative ways to reach groups susceptible to online radicalisation by accredited religious clerics. Case in point is the Asatizah Youth Network, a group of 30 young religious clerics, who are trained to utilise social media platforms to reach out to youth. These clerics discuss and refute distorted extremist ideologies online through creative ways that appeal to their targeted audience. Alternative narratives are also conveyed through offline pop-up events, online interactive video-logs and Buzzfeed-like articles. Since it was first set up in 2017, it has been able to amplify the profile of local religious clerics within the community and increase the public\u2019s confidence to turn to them for religious guidance vis-\u00e0-vis online extremist clerics, who propagate exclusivist teachings that are not suitable in Singapore\u2019s multi-racial and religious context. Where Do We Go From Here? Distortions of Islamic jurisprudence and governance such as that held by Imran must be debunked rigorously. The religious and community leaders must continue to seek new and innovative ways to transmit the right understanding of Islam and values of religious tolerance and moderation to the Muslim community. For example, sermons and education and outreach programmes must continue to be dynamic and able to reach different community segments via various modalities and languages. The day-to-day lived reality of local Muslims, based on responsible citizenry, tolerance and moderation, is the context which must remain at the front and centre of such initiatives."

    "title": "Global Health Security: COVID-19 & Its Impacts BRI and Indo-Pacific: Geopolitics of Multilateralism?",
    "author(s)": "By Nazia Hussain & Amalina Anuar",
    "date": "No. 157 \u2013 13 August 2020",
    "content": "BOTH THE Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) are being updated for a post-pandemic world. Yet while crisis provokes, it also reveals. The pandemic is not only laying bare innovations in multilateral mechanisms, but also illuminating the strengths and weaknesses undergirding these strategies \u2014 ones that are intrinsic to greater cohesion within these mechanisms. In recent months, Beijing has switched gears to highlight the Digital Silk Road (DSR) and Health Silk Road (HSR) \u2014 two pre-pandemic initiatives that have gained new credence as the physical BRI gets put on pause. The DSR could make further inroads globally as the pandemic accelerates digitalisation. But as it covers a range of issues, from e-commerce and smart cities to 5G networks, progress will be uneven. Enter the Digital and Health Silk Roads Cross-border e-commerce cooperation is likely welcome amidst a broader milieu of protectionism and plummeting economic growth. But Chinese technological offerings will see greater pushback and external shocks induced by the United States and its allies. Washington\u2019s anti-Huawei campaign in the 5G sphere, a battlefront for technological leadership, is ongoing. Security concerns vis-\u00e0-vis enabling Beijing\u2019s backdoor espionage and accusations of bolstering authoritarian governance in recipient countries through their technologies, including surveillance applications tied to the HSR, collectively dog Chinese tech firms. These market players are key enablers of the DSR. But in the face of disrupted supply chains, sanctions and negative press \u2014 which could intensify as Beijing injects the DSR with greater nationalist overtones and more state intervention \u2014 substantively delivering on the DSR going forward could be an even bumpier road. The HSR, meanwhile, is picking up pace since its inception in 2015. China\u2019s medical diplomacy has found a receptive audience \u2014 particularly in countries disadvantaged in the race to secure medical supplies and vaccines, and struggling with under- resourced healthcare systems. But a greater endorsement of the HSR could face an uphill battle: Beijing\u2019s handling of COVID-19 has invited much scrutiny, whether for scapegoating to deflect from domestic failings or actual transparency concerns. The HSR\u2019s trajectory too will be two-speed at best, given these mixed reactions. Like the BRI in general, it is a victim of anti-illiberal sentiments but also of Beijing\u2019s own political choices. Enter the \u201cQuad Plus\u201d While COVID-19 has, at least for the time being, altered the course of traditional economic diplomacy, the pandemic has also presented an opportunity to realign the focus of Indo-Pacific cooperation and the Quad towards tackling health security at an operational level. The four Quad countries \u2500 Australia, India, Japan and the United States \u2500 have been meeting in a \u201cQuad Plus\u201d format along with New Zealand, South Korea and Vietnam to discuss issues of cooperation such as trade facilitation, vaccine development, challenges of stranded citizens, assistance to countries in need, and sharing technologies. These recent weekly Quad Plus meetings may be an early sign of how the regional multilateral architecture could change. With various articulations of the Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) floating around, the Indo-Pacific concept has largely been greeted with cautious hesitation, not least because its conceptualisation, scope and modus operandi remain unclear. Wary of the China-containment narrative associated with the FOIP and its Quad mechanism, Indo-Pacific countries such as New Zealand and South Korea had been reluctant to ardently endorse the concept, lest they be seen as choosing sides in the US-China strategic competition. It is therefore of some significance that Wellington and Seoul have been participating in the Quad Plus meetings. However, the Quad is relatively uncoordinated at the moment, partly due to unreliability of the US. Also, there is a lack of consensus within the Quad on how to address the magnitude and urgency of the China threat and chart an adequate response. Great Awakening or Transparency Deficit? New partnerships and dimensions of cooperation (and competition) could inject vigour into these geopolitical projects. But whether they will \u2014 or can \u2014 self-diagnose their weaknesses is another question altogether. A transparency deficit still bedevils the BRI overall. This has been addressed somewhat with the push towards greater multilateralisation vis-\u00e0-vis the physical BRI. But it remains to be seen whether transparency and good governance along the physical BRI alone is sufficient to secure greater endorsement. Transparency issues vis-\u00e0-vis the technologies featured in the DSR and HSR cannot be mitigated via similar means because they are considered inextricable with authoritarian governance and China-induced economic, military and technological insecurity. Opposition to the BRI turns on broader anti-illiberal sentiments. Wariness on the part of Washington and its allies towards the BRI may thus persist short of an overhaul of the Chinese political-economic model \u2014 an unlikely option on Beijing\u2019s end. The China-Containment Narrative The Indo-Pacific\u2019s multilateral structure encourages greater buy-in, but it remains saddled with the China-containment narrative. A Biden White House in lieu of a Trump re-election could reset geopolitical dynamics. But there is unlikely to be a major departure from the main tenets of US Indo-Pacific strategy away from military-strategic considerations vis-\u00e0-vis China. Although the US does not overtly state FOIP as a containment mechanism aimed at China, the buzzword being \u201cfree\u201d already defines the conditionality associated with the concept. While stressing that no one is excluded, the US aspires to a regional order of independent nations in the Indo-Pacific. This regional order is characterised by the defence of its populations, respect for human dignity, fair competition in the marketplace, and freedom from great power domination. Thus, it may not be easy for China to be part of the FOIP even if Beijing wished to be included. The China-containment narrative is likely to stick. Quo Vadis? Connotations attached to the BRI and Indo-Pacific will probably persist, owing to fundamental differences in political-economic models. Easing stark conflicts between the two and their advocates for greater buy-in is, nonetheless, still possible. Beyond continued BRI multilateralisation, China could reduce actions seen as dividing members of regional blocs, and dial down \u2018wolf warrior diplomacy\u2019 and disinformation along the DSR and HSR. Warlike rhetoric, heavy-handed coronavirus spin, and smear campaigns in the countries it is trying to engage with does the BRI no favours. Ultimately, China needs to build up trust. Meanwhile, the Indo-Pacific powers could look into offering initiatives that are not rolled out with the sole purpose of providing competition to China\u2019s BRI, whether in infrastructure development or health diplomacy. The US needs to be able to frame the FOIP as one that is not about containing China but supporting feasible programmes of development with respect for sovereignty to make it palatable for countries to sign up for the concept."

    "title": "Trade Multilateralism: Alive and Well Despite Trump",
    "author(s)": "By Pradumna B Rana",
    "date": "No. 147 \u2013 20 July 2020",
    "content": "THE FOCUS of the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944, led by the United States and other Western powers, was to establish a number of rules-based international economic institutions to provide global public goods. In the area of finance, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was established to provide short-term finance for macroeconomic stability, and the World Bank was created to provide long-term development finance for poverty reduction in developing countries. The General Agreement on Tariffs and trade (GATT) was established to promote an open global trading environment. In 1995, the GATT was replaced by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) which at that time had 123 member countries as compared to 164 at the present. This rules-based multilateralism has brought about unprecedented economic prosperity and social development all over the world. From Centralised to Decentralising Multilateralism Presently, however, the world is moving from the system of centralised multilateralism towards decentralising multilateralism or a multi-layered system with the WTO as the senior global institution and various regional and inter-regional free trade agreements (FTAs). The European Union (EU), Japan, and China have taken a stand against Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d and his emphasis on \u201cbilateral and reciprocal trade\u201d and signed a large number of regional and inter-regional FTAs with other trading partners. Soon after Trump\u2019s inauguration, the European Parliament gave its consent to the Canada-EU Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement. The Japan-EU Economic Partnership Agreement came in force on 1 February 2019. The EU approved the EU-Singapore trade pact in February 2019, signed the agreement with Vietnam in June 2019, and is negotiating with Indonesia, Australia, and New Zealand. EU negotiations with China for a bilateral investment agreement are also progressing albeit slowly. Japan is playing an active role in promoting regional and inter-regional free trade areas (FTAs) as the US retreats. It has played a key role in driving the 11-country Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTTP). A number of high profile officials from Beijing have recently voiced opinions about China\u2019s interest in joining the CPTPP, although no official contact has yet been made. Contested Multilateralism Japan is also working with China and ASEAN on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), Recently, India announced that it would not join the grouping. The remaining countries are expected to sign the RCEP Agreement later this year. Thanks to Tokyo\u2019s persistence, progress is also being made on a China- Japan-Korea trade agreement. China has taken a complimentary approach to regionalism and inter-regionalism, by focusing on infrastructure and physical connectivity. In this regard, President Xi Jinping\u2019s signature project, the Belt and Road Initiative, is the main game in town. How has the establishment of new regional and inter-regional FTAs, which has led to the decentralising trade multilateralism, affected the governance of international trade? Unlike the \u201ccontested multilateralism\u201d theorists who focus only on the costs, one has to consider both the benefits as well as the costs of the process. Decentralising Multilateralism: Benefits and Costs On the side of benefits, first, regional and inter-regional FTAs provide an alternative approach to liberalising trade and are useful when WTO negotiations stall, as is the case at the present time. Second, modern regional and inter-regional FTAs typically promote deeper integration as compared to the shallower integration of the WTO which mainly tackles \u201con-the-border\u201d barriers. Regional and inter-regional FTAs can therefore address \u201cbehind the border\u201d issues such as rules for protecting investments, intellectual property, environment and labour rights, and regulations on product standards that are relevant to supply chain trade which now constitutes a bulk of global trade. There are, however, a number of costs for regional and inter-regional FTAs. The first is that they are discriminatory in nature. Granting preferences to some countries effectively discriminates against trade with others which could be more efficient trading partners, resulting in potentially costly trade diversion. That said, problems with trade diversion are more serious at the theoretical level than in practice. The second category of risks associated with regional and inter-regional FTAs are the so-called \u201cspaghetti bowl\u201d effects. This arises when overlapping FTAs create a web of trade agreements with different documentation rules, inspection procedure, and rules of origin, in effect raising the transaction and compliance costs for businesses. While there is some element of truth, a number of studies including one by the Asian Development Bank and the other by the Inter-American Development Bank have found that these costs tend to be overestimated. Going Forward: Strengthening \"WTO Centrality\"? The third cost is the fear that regional and inter-regional FTAs, especially the mega- FTAs which are sizable and cover large segments of world trade and GDP, could undermine \u201cWTO Centrality\u201d mainly in litigating trade disputes. But again several other authors have found that, in actuality, the dispute settlement procedures contained in regional and inter-regional FTAs have not introduced direct competition with the WTO. A significant number of disputes tabled at the WTO have involved members of existing their bilateral regional and disagreements. On the whole, the benefits of new regional and inter-reginal FTAs and the decentralising multilateralism appear to have outweighed the costs, mainly because the latter are overstated. inter-regional FTAs using to resolve the WTO The move from centralised to decentralising trade multilateralism, therefore, may have improved global trade governance. The move could have also enhanced the resilience of Asian countries to global shocks like COVID-19 by enabling diversification of trade and supply chains. Looking ahead, a number of policy measures should be taken to manage the decentralisation process by reforming the WTO. The WTO should also enhance further its collaboration with regional and inter-regional FTAs."

    "author(s)": "By Deep K Datta-Ray",
    "date": "No. 197 \u2013 18 November 2020",
    "content": "AS PRESIDENT of the United States, Donald Trump has been the foremost practitioner of a highly unorthodox model of politics. Its latest instance is Trump\u2019s exceptional, and troubling, refusal to concede electoral defeat. Nevertheless, his brand of politics is seeing some political figures around the world mirroring him in a bid to build and sustain a dedicated and passionate support base. For Trump, a key factor has been passion, which guided policy decisions at home and abroad. He signalled this approach in his inauguration in January 2017, when he declared: \u201cFrom this moment on, it\u2019s going to be America First.\u201d That informed his decisions, such as having the US quit the World Health Organisation (WHO) in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. This action depleted global goodwill Washington D.C., had earned by long being in the forefront of battles against debilitating diseases and health crises. Post-Globalisation Politics Trump\u2019s style of politics has become a defining characteristic of \u201cpost-globalisation\u201d in which politics are based on emotional bias rather than conventional interests. This is a dramatic change for it changes what we know as the anchor for politics and the governance of nation-states. At the centre of the change Trump is emblematic of is post-globalisation undoing the historical entwinement of vested interests with politics. That intermeshing began in 19th century Europe, spread to the US, and was defined by voting rights being contingent on property ownership. The shackling of politics to such interests had cultural and other repercussions. The vote began to be prised away from the propertied class from the close of the 19th century and the electorate began to expand. Yet property continued to maintain its grip on politics. The means were political parties, most of which continued to guard the interests of the propertied class. Today, that class has expanded and vastly multiplied its holdings. So much so, that the propertied class\u2019 assets are often demarcated as nations and its history of ownership is viewed as national history. The fastening of politics to interests founded in the depths of history and across the globe had a purpose: to promote stability by suppressing the alternative: passion. Unfettered by interests, passions are effervescent and ephemeral. Most significantly, the politics of passion is contingent on personality and triggered unpredictability \u2013 as seen in Trump\u2019s actions considered \u201cun-presidential\u201d as well as his very heavy use of Twitter to castigate opponents. Trumpian Politics Globally Similarly, in international politics, Trump gambled America\u2019s interests in further developing an ally by threatening retaliation against India for its decision to not export a drug for COVID-19, because it is clinically unproven. Indicating the significance of passion is Trump\u2019s outsider status that undermined the longstanding interests of the Republicans in the US. The hollowing-out in terms of policy is so complete that the established ideals and code of conduct of the Republican Party were effectively relegated by Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d rhetoric and the policies they catalysed. Nor is Trump alone in eviscerating the politics of interests. In Asia, India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, was the unexpected outsider who swept away the Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s establishment. Another instance from Asia is Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. He broke multiple norms \u2013 and has been castigated by many in other countries \u2013 but remains highly popular with most of his country\u2019s citizens. Similarly, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and Hungarian President Viktor Orb\u00e1n too have shifted away from interests. Bolsonaro has repeatedly ignored the threat of COVID-19 to the national interests by dismissing it as \u201ca little cold\u201d. Meanwhile, Orb\u00e1n is undermining Hungary\u2019s national interests by turning away from the benefits of membership in the European Union. EU parliamentarians and officials are becoming more concerned with what they see as the Hungarian leader's \"illiberal tendencies\" which have resonance with voters in his country. Unprecedented Norms of Post-Globalisation Behaviour that breaks norms arising from interests is the main agent of post- globalisation. The changes to politics they triggered are tangible. Established patterns of trade and investment are being changed, and on a scale unseen since the end of the Cold War. Trump\u2019s diktats to governments in and out of the US, for example, his curtailing of private consumers\u2019 choice, and rejecting of green and sustainable environment policies are unprecedented. A clear case is the prohibition on Google collaborating with Huawei. Also, entire regions like the Middle East are told to choose between Washington and Beijing. Another effect of these changes is that the very language of politics is being remade. For instance, Scotland\u2019s desire for the European Union is called nationalism but is unlike the usual understanding of that word. That is because Scotland\u2019s desires are now disconnected to property and so the history and geography of nation-states. Indeed, London is preparing to counter moves by Scotland to exit the UK to join the EU. The politics of passion however do engender possibilities unseen previously. The personification of politics makes for an intensity and dynamism impossible in the old model because it was motivated by just property (that is, national interests). Managing the Volatility of Trumpian Politics Note for instance the US engagement with North Korea in 2018, regarded by Trump as a breakthrough, although it yielded not much more than a photo opportunity. It did not produce the Nobel Peace Prize Trump was hoping to get, though the sessions with Kim Jong-Un created history, which the president talked up as his achievement. In the North Korea case, Trump did not just break a norm, he crushed it when agreeing to meet the head of a government the US had no relations with and who is feared could launch missile attacks. Trump passionately sought a nuclear deal with Kim, who he said wrote him beautiful letters and that the two \u201cfell in love\u201d. However, that Trump was heavily criticised at home and away for appearing to get on better with dictators than with America's traditional allies, indicates the perils of his unconventional model of politics. Evidently the politics of post-globalisation is marked by volatility. What this calls for is agility and flexibility in management, not just by calculating interests but also viewing them through the prism of emotions and segmentation of policy issues, as leaders across the globe increasingly utilise both. Donald Trump has shown another dimension of the art of the possible."

    "content": "AS OF 10 May 2020, Russia has 209,688 COVID-19 infection cases, 1,915 deaths and 34,306 recovered patients. Moscow and the region it is in \u2014 the most populous city and part of the country \u2014 account for the largest number of cases. The lockdown announced in late March, initially for a week, was extended twice to 11 May. President Putin noted that \u201cRussia has managed to slow down the spread of the epidemic, but we haven't passed the peak yet\u201d. Predictably, the lockdown is unpopular. A gradual lifting of the restrictions will begin on 12 May. However, Moscow, the hardest hit, has extended its restrictions to the end of May. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin himself fell victim to the virus, informing President Putin on 30 April that he had been tested positive and would go into self- isolation. Economic impact The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has estimated that Russia\u2019s GDP could contract by 5.5 per cent; however, according to Audit Chamber chief and former finance minister Alexei Kudrin, GDP might fall as much as 6-8 per cent and unemployment could reach eight million. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov has stressed that the budget was under increased pressure because of the \u201cdouble effect\u201d of the pandemic and sharp drop of oil prices. Nevertheless, he was confident about Russia being able to manage the crisis, as the country had \u201cenough reserves to overcome the situation\u201d. Oil and gas account for 65% of Russia's exports and around 30 per cent of its budgetary revenue. Government\u2019s Response The initial measures taken included restrictions on inbound and outbound traffic from and to China and European countries severely affected by COVID-19; quarantine and observation measures; and restrictions on the export of certain goods such as masks and respirators. Subsequently, when it became clear that the virus was spreading in the country faster than expected, closure of borders and restrictions on the activities of citizens and the closure of schools, parks, and commercial facilities were introduced. To deal with the economic impact, the government\u2019s support measures total about 2.8 per cent of GDP. These range from additional monthly instalments for families with young children and increased unemployment benefits to the extension of tax deadlines (up to six months) as well as a temporary ban on penalty for overdue debt and a 3- month rent holiday for government properties. Some Russian economists do not think the current support measures are sufficient; Georgiy Ostapkovich, head of the Centre for Market Studies in the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, is of the view that the government should spend 5-6 per cent of GDP to stop a recession. Socio-political Impact President Putin came under criticism for his apparent lackadaisical approach in handling the COVID-19 challenge in its initial stages. He had left the management of the situation to trusted lieutenants like Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin, PM Mishustin and the regional governors. His motivations could either have been his wish to delegate more power and responsibilities to these office holders or not to be associated too closely with a crisis which could have a negative impact on his own popularity. However, as the pandemic began to assume alarming proportions, Putin quickly took direct control of the situation. He has appeared on live TV via video conference, listening to assessments by various federal and regional officials and then giving instructions on the needed responses. His political position appears not to have been damaged by the pandemic. He has shown that he is willing to make unpopular but necessary decisions to safeguard the country, including those which affect his political prestige and position. Two examples highlight this point \u2013 the postponement of the 22 April 2020 referendum on constitutional amendments which would enable him to rerun for the presidency when his term ends in 2024, and the 9 May 2020 Victory Parade commemorating the 75th anniversary of Russia\u2019s victory over Nazi Germany. No Alternative to Putin The latest poll in Moscow shows that 75 per cent of respondents backed the measures introduced so far. More significantly, polls also show that support for the constitutional changes that would extend Putin\u2019s term in office until 2036, has risen to 47 per cent in April, compared to 40 per cent in March. Russia is economically prepared to deal with the high economic cost of the pandemic, with large financial reserves \u2013 US$563 billion and another US$157 billion in the NWF sovereign wealth fund. Domestically, there is still no nation-wide leadership alternative to Putin \u2014 whether within the ranks of the loyal opposition (in the Duma or Federation Council, the civil service, etc) or non-systemic opposition. Members of his inner circle or the elite would not attempt to replace him, for their close association with him would render them open to political retribution by forces outside the system. The National Guard led by Viktor Zolotov, an old follower, ensures that any violent internal challenge would be met with an appropriate response. Established in 2016, it reports directly to Putin and is separate from the Armed Forces of Russia. Foreign Policy Impact Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov expectedly called on all countries to put differences aside and pool their efforts to combat the pandemic. The United States was uppermost on his mind \u2014 he pointed to a joint statement by Presidents Putin and Donald Trump dedicated to the 75th anniversary of the Elbe Day on 25 April 2020 (US and Soviet forces first met on the Elbe on that day in 1945). This was a clear effort to reduce current tensions with the US. Russia is keen on an extension of the New START Treaty (a nuclear weapons\u2019 reduction and limitation agreement) which expires in 2021 while the US has not shown the same level of enthusiasm. Reports of limited Russian assistance to Italy and the US in March and early April were met with scepticism. These actions were also part of Russia\u2019s actions to strengthen overall ties with the West. To balance relations with China, Putin has assured Chinese President Xi Jinping of Russia\u2019s support in the face of US criticism, during their phone conversation on 16 April. Putin reportedly said that attempts to blame China on the origin of the coronavirus were unacceptable. President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement on 14 April of the US\u2019 suspension of funding for the World Health Organisation (WHO), alleging that it had mismanaged and covered-up the virus\u2019 spread, predictably did not meet with Russia\u2019s approval. The Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, expressed Russia\u2019s support for the \u201cWHO\u2019s leadership to combat the coronavirus\u201d. The skilful manoeuvre by Russia on the way WHO\u2019s activities can go forward may bring a reprieve in the tense atmosphere in pandemic management at the international body. Overall, however, Russia has yet to play an active role in multilateral cooperation against the pandemic."

    "author(s)": "By Alistair D. B. Cook",
    "date": "No. 044 \u2013 20 March 2020",
    "content": "THE RED Cross Movement has had an active global awareness raising campaign during the COVID-19 outbreak along with other international organisations and NGOs. They all highlight those most vulnerable to coronavirus, but many media outlets miss out a number of these categories: the elderly, healthcare workers, people with chronic diseases, disabled people, detainees, homeless people, prisoners, refugees and displaced people. People living in refugee or displaced persons camps often face overcrowded housing situations which increases the risk of the quick spread of COVID-19 through their communities. It often means they are also already exposed to other infectious diseases. Impact on Refugees and Vulnerable Groups Across the world, the top five countries with the most refugees per 1,000 inhabitants were Lebanon (164), Jordan (71), Turkey (43), Uganda (32), and Chad (28). In the Asia-Pacific, Kutupalong in Cox\u2019s Bazar, Bangladesh, is the world\u2019s largest refugee settlement housing more than 630,000 people spread across only five square miles. It is important to keep these communities and countries in mind when developing a global response to the pandemic \u2013 we need to be ready and prepared to help those most in need. All national action plans for COVID-19 for countries hosting refugees and irregular migrants need to explicitly include these communities. COVID-19 is now found in more than 140 countries. Some of these are already exposed to humanitarian situations as a result of conflicts, disasters and climate change. On 17 March 2020, both the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the UN Refugee Agency announced that they are suspending resettlement travel for refugees. As countries have closed their borders to the fast-evolving COVID-19 situation, some families have experienced delays, been stranded or separated. Both agencies pledged to continue their work in refugee-hosting countries to ensure processing claims continue. They also noted that international travel could also increase exposure to COVID-19. Therefore, it is necessary to raise awareness about COVID-19 among the refugee and for governments, displaced person community. international organisations and to develop consistent crisis communications on COVID-19 to avoid mixed messages and confusion which can spread fear and misinformation. is essential the humanitarian bodies It Some efforts have already taken shape with community-based organisations and diaspora groups translating public health practices into vernacular languages for refugee and displaced person camps. Disabled People & Paradox of Developing Countries Another concern is for those most vulnerable within such communities. As Catalina Devandas, United Nations Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities, warns there is little guidance and support for disabled people who can be disproportionately affected by social distancing and containment measures. In Singapore, the Superhero ME is an educational resource package for children and people with disabilities which has added COVID-19 response measures to its online platform offering guidance and support for disabled people. This is an example of how online awareness raising activities during the pandemic response can reach vulnerable communities. These are some isolated examples on how to address these challenges but a more comprehensive and inclusive COVID-19 pandemic response is needed with funds to match. There is a paradox, according to Dr Michael Ryan, who leads the WHO\u2019s Health Emergencies Programme and a trained epidemiologist: many systems in developing countries and conflict settings are more resilient than some settings in the West. This is because camp managers know that measles, meningitis or cholera epidemics severely impact these communities, so there are active early warning and public health-focused systems in place that can be repurposed to fit the new pandemic. However, for COVID-19, items such as respirators, personal protective equipment and reliable laboratory testing will still be in short supply. Who Pays? At the beginning of March 2020, the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator released US$15 million from the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to support WHO and UNICEF efforts to contain COVID-19 in vulnerable countries. The World Bank is offering $1.1 billion in grants of new money and repurposing $2.2 billion for lower income countries to tackle the pandemic. This $3.5 billion amount raised from donor countries and other stakeholders like philanthropic institutions and the private sector compares to the UK Chancellor announcing last week in his budget a \u00a330 billion package ($36.3 billion) of support for people and businesses in the UK. This was followed on Tuesday 17 March with an additional \u00a3330 billion ($400 billion) of guarantees \u2013 equivalent to 15% of the UK\u2019s GDP. This is a stark difference and while the global funds for lower income countries are welcome, they are insufficient. Leave No-One Behind The World Health Organisation (WHO) has developed the COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan for countries most at risk and with the weakest health systems. This effort will be supported by the recently announced COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund. This fund was launched by the US-registered United Nations Foundation and Swiss Philanthropy Foundation with the WHO on 13 March. It aims to finance protective equipment for healthcare workers; equip laboratories; improve surveillance and data collection; establish and maintain intensive care units; strengthen supply chains; accelerate research and development of vaccines; and the broader public health response to COVID-19. The fund looks to individual and institutional donors to support its efforts. These affected communities already reside in precarious situations with limited access to healthcare and other daily essentials. It is important for countries and other stakeholders to come together to support the refugees and displaced persons, and their host countries with and those expecting COVID-19. This will require coordinated international support to assist those most in need. It is in times of such global insecurities that the most vulnerable can be left out-of- sight, out-of-mind. As many UN officials now signal, it is important to leave no-one behind and make the COVID-19 pandemic response one founded on global solidarity. This is necessary because ultimately the coronavirus knows no borders or nationalities, only viral hosts."

    "title": "BLM Movement: Singapore and Glocalisation",
    "author(s)": "By Norman Vasu and Yasmine Wong",
    "date": "No. 141 \u2013 13 July 2020",
    "content": "THE KILLING of George Floyd in the United States brought about international reverberations felt far and wide. Mass protests have erupted from Oslo to Osaka and from Bogot\u00e1 to Berlin. The global protests began with marches in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement\u2019s desire to end police brutality and systemic racism in the US. While this is so, the raison d'\u00eatre of international protests have transmogrified into protests over how a colonial past should be understood, whether statues of individuals who profited from the slave trade should remain erect, and how minorities and indigenous communities are treated. Glocalisation: Internationalising Local Events This internationalisation of a domestic event has led to some puzzlement and concern. The Australian prime minister, having witnessed protests in Sydney denouncing both the killing of George Floyd and Indigenous Australian deaths in police custody, warned that movements happening overseas should not be imported to Australia. The BLM movement has also led to conversations about being a minority in Singapore. For example, a picture of students in Raffles Institution donning black masks and black painted faces to celebrate the birthday of an Indian classmate surfaced online in the wake of BLM, prompting a response by the minister for education. Whilst acknowledging the existence of racial insensitivities in Singapore, he stressed the historical and contextual differences between Singapore and the US. How best can this internationalisation of a seemingly domestic event be understood? The manifestation of the various guises of the BLM movement internationally is perhaps most appropriately understood through the concept of glocalisation. Glocalisation, a concept that is a portmanteau of the processes of globalisation and localisation, is employed to describe the resultant product of the global interacting with the local. This interaction creates something shared globally while also simultaneously exhibiting recognisable elements of the local context within which it is embedded. Expressed differently, the product of glocalisation has internationally recognisable common features but its multiple forms around the world have distinct local characteristics. An often employed illustration of glocalisation is the ubiquitous fast food conglomerate McDonald\u2019s. McDonald\u2019s restaurants around the world share common identifiable features \u2013 the golden arches along with the red and yellow colour scheme for example \u2013 while concurrently displaying local peculiarities \u2013 a Quarter Ponder with Cheese is instead a Royal Cheese in France owing to France\u2019s use of the metric system. Glocalisation of BLM in Singapore The utility of the concept of glocalisation in understanding what is currently happening is three-fold and all three elements can be seen in the way the BLM movement has actualised in Singapore. The globalisation in glocalisation First, the globalisation element of the glocalisation explains why antiracism, a fundamental driver of the BLM movement, has gained international traction. In the context of Singapore, the global message of antiracism resonates with segments of Singapore\u2019s society as discussions on racism in Singapore predate the movement. Testimony to this may be found in the existence of Instagram accounts like minority voices which elevates experiences of everyday racisms faced by minorities in Singapore before the BLM movement. Another recent example of how discussions on racism are not alien to Singapore would be the controversy surrounding the NETs E- Pay advertisement in 2019. The advertisement had a Chinese actor artificially darkening his face to portray an Indian man and a Malay woman in a headscarf. This advertisement drew ire and a discussion on the offensiveness of \u201cBrownface\u201d. The localisation in glocalisation Second, the localisation in glocalisation captures why protests internationally have adopted and applied antiracism to locally specific causes. In Singapore, owing to its specific milieu, glocalisation metamorphosised BLM\u2019s antiracism drive into discussions on the lived experience of being a racial minority in Singapore, the treatment of migrant workers, as well as the manner in which Singapore\u2019s colonial past should be understood and treated. The focus on the local brought about by the global is illustrated through the manner in which many have pointed out how support for BLM should not be done at the expense of ignoring racism and xenophobia at home. Discussions were rooted in what injustice looks like in Singapore and what the BLM movement means to Singapore, manifesting in the creation of a publicly available compilation of Singapore-specific material on race and the emergence of more online platforms such as hearmesg to consolidate personal anecdotes on discrimination. Furthermore, as BLM has also inspired the struggle against white supremacy, states have been forced to confront their treatment and understanding of colonial histories. Singapore has been no exception here. In the context of Singapore, questions have been asked of the appropriateness of Stamford Raffles being commemorated through a statue, considering his racist imperial legacy. The glocalisation of protest Third, glocalisation also explains the different responses to the BLM movement. Despite the threat of COVID-19, protestors around the globe have come out in force. However, protesting is not in everyone\u2019s cultural DNA, and it is certainly not in Singapore\u2019s. The negative perception of protests as an illegitimate form of political action has been engrained in historical memory, and is enforced by the government\u2019s zero-tolerance approach to illegal protests. Instead, discussions mostly take place on social media, not only because protesting is not a norm in Singapore but also perhaps because social media platforms allow for the creation of spaces to discuss topics like race and religion\u2014issues considered taboo in mainstream spaces. By understanding how glocalisation has affected the BLM movement, unease expressed over the adoption of a supposed alien concept to a local context may be quelled. In the same manner the Quarter Pounder with Cheese is also a Royal Cheese, Singapore has effectively glocalised the BLM movement for causes that are an integral part of its social fabric with calls against immutable interpretations of history, for workers to be treated better, and racism to be eradicated. Capturing this nuance, glocalisation is not only the best way to understand the BLM movement\u2019s impact on Singapore\u2019s society but it is also a manner to anticipate what future movements will bring."

    "author(s)": "By Victor R Savage",
    "date": "No. 140 \u2013 13 July 2020",
    "content": "IN A curious way, China developed its civilisational power from within. Throughout its 4,000-year history, Chinese civilisation was not mired in external wars of territorial expansion and colonial exploits. It was an introverted civilisation, contented with endorsing its cultural egotism as the supreme power mandated from heaven. The historical geographer, Paul Wheatley, called the Chinese imperial system the \u201cpivot of the four quarters\u201d. Hence every other foreign king, ruler and emissary had to show deference and acknowledge the emperor\u2019s exalted position. China\u2019s Civilisational Power For most of its history, China was an inward-looking civilisation. China and India were economically the most powerful civilisations up to the 18th-century. Before the 13th- century, China was a scientific and technological driver. Joseph Needham initiated the documentation of China\u2019s scientific developments in Cambridge University\u2019s Needham Institute (1954-present). In some ways, foreign fears of China\u2019s power were historically a product of its brief interlude as the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty (1279-1368). China was a surrogate power of the Mongols that ruled with terror over the vast Eurasian landmass. Ironically, Chinese dynasties were terrified of the marauding Mongols and erected the Great Wall on its western front to keep them out of China. Hence China was concerned with territorial containment rather than spatial expansion. Despite the Ming Dynasty\u2019s Zheng He voyages in the Indian Ocean, China showed its flag but not its might. Western travellers like Marco Polo (1254-1324), and the Roman Catholic missionary, Matteo Ricci (1552-1610), took note of China\u2019s civilisation as the Celestial kingdom gained recognition in the West through \u2018soft power\u2019 with the 18th-century Chinoiserie vogue. China\u2019s Demise as an Oriental Power Media analysts repeat the mantra that China\u2019s current determined rise is to make up for its 19th-century humiliation by western powers. This might be partly true. But the Celestial empire\u2019s decline had more to do with domestic problems, its corrupt bureaucracy, inept imperial leadership, fragmenting political system, growing poverty and mass economic restlessness. China caved in from within and was exploited by colonial powers. Without domestic malaise and poverty, the 19th-century Chinese diaspora in Southeast Asia would never have been a reality. Without the mass disgruntlement with imperial rule, the communist revolution of Mao Zedong (1893-1976) would remain a Marxist concept. Mao\u2019s experimentation with communism through the Cultural Revolution, was a disaster by most accounts. It took Deng Xiaoping (1904-1997), to correct Mao\u2019s mistakes by, ironically, adopting capitalism. Finally, after many political miscarriages, the Celestial kingdom was ready to venture into righting domestic disorders. After his visit to Singapore in 1978, Deng realised how much progress was made under capitalism, and how backward China remained under communism. Pragmatic Deng is best remembered for his dictum, black or white cat, they both catch mice. He and his following chosen leaders were keen on putting China\u2019s house in order. They were fortunate that the western powers, abetted and aided the development of the Middle Kingdom for their own interest. Deng however, realised the humongous task of getting China\u2019s development on the right track and hence cautioned Chinese leaders on embarking in external forays. Returning Power, Rising Power or Hegemonic Power? The idea of China as a \u201creturning power\u201d in the current context, thus needs qualifications in three ways. Firstly, the Chinese ambition of being counted as a global power is predicated on President Xi Jinping\u2019s impatient personal ambitions and his quest to raise the national stakes for international legitimacy. Secondly, Xi has made a major paradigm shift in defining China\u2019s power. While accepting China\u2019s \u2018Middle Kingdom\u2019 status, Xi\u2019s modus operandi is not returning China to its \u2018closed-door\u2019 divine status of Tian Xia (Everything under the Heavens) but setting his sights on making China a functional pivot in which literally \u2018all roads lead to Beijing\u2019. Xi\u2019s Belt and Road initiative (BRI), is a pragmatic, modern enunciation of the Middle Kingdom\u2019s historical persona. Thirdly, throwing Deng\u2019s caution to the wind, Xi wants to make China a global hegemonic power. This global ambition is playing itself out in Graham Allison\u2019s thesis of the Thucydides trap. Tired of the Western control of international geopolitics, capitalistic economics and soft culture, Xi wants to rewrite a Global Operations manual with its own national characteristics. Both the West and China have to contend with their albatross of racism. While the West has been plagued with racial White power, the Chinese have been raised on the racial menu of the Han people surrounded by barbarians. China\u2019s Global Hegemonic Role President Xi as China\u2019s life-long quasi-emperor of an authoritarian state believes in the pragmatic building of China\u2019s global power. Taking the cue from Marxist ideology, Xi wants to demonstrate the commanding role of human power. Xi\u2019s new China translates into conquering distance, managing spatial entities, controlling nature, and shaping an international order. In the process, the Xi regime hopes to challenge other foreign democratic regimes especially in the West, with his consolidated fused political-economic system of seemingly diametrically opposite ideological systems. Xi\u2019s operational power of metamorphosis is a synthesis of China\u2019s civilisational geopolitical culture with the current tools of digitisation, electronic engineering, and infrastructural development. Under the Xi regime\u2019s worldview, China is a secular simulation of the \u201cMiddle Kingdom\u201d but as a global hegemon. China\u2019s State Counsellor of Foreign Affairs, Yang Jiechi, reminded Singapore\u2019s then Foreign Minister, George Yeo, that a \u201cbig country\u201d was not expected to cede to the interests of small countries. Xi\u2019s most adventurous and risky initiatives, debunking China\u2019s peaceful rise, are his territorial claims of border areas in Nepal, India, Southeast Asia, the South China Sea and the Japan Sea. Time will tell whether these territorial ambitions will bear fruit or undermine China\u2019s global hegemonic objectives."

    "title": "KRI Nanggala-402: Time to Boost Maritime Cooperation",
    "author(s)": "By John Bradford",
    "date": "No. 068 \u2013 26 April 2021",
    "content": "TIME TRAGICALLY ran out for the crew of Indonesia\u2019s submarine KRI Nanggala-402. When the Indonesian Navy lost contact with the boat conducting a torpedo exercise in waters north of Bali on Wednesday 21 April 2021, leaders immediately knew they were in a race against time to bring their sailors home safely. When they did not hear from the submarine via a battery-power backup channel and did not detect an emergency beacon, it became clear the best-case scenario was that the crew was alive, but unable to surface. Even in this optimal situation the crew would be trapped with limited oxygen supplies, just 72 hours according to estimates shared with the public. The Indonesian Navy immediately deployed ships and aircraft to locate the missing vessel. Turning to Friends for Help Indonesia also turned to friends for help. In particular, Jakarta asked partner navies to deploy search assets and specialised sub-rescue equipment. The international support that followed reaffirmed the value of international maritime cooperation and demonstrated the continued need for further expansions to cooperative maritime capacity. When the Indonesian Navy alerted the International Submarine Escape and Rescue Liaison Office (ISMERLO), the cooperative body manned its operations room to provide continual assistance and international coordination. Singapore was the first to deploy response forces. On Wednesday afternoon, the Republic of Singapore Navy\u2019s submarine rescue vessel Swift Rescue sailed from Changi Naval Base. Thursday morning, Malaysia\u2019s submarine rescue ship Mega Bakti got underway from Kota Kinabulu. On the same day, the Indian defence ministry announced that its Deep Submergence Rescue Vessel (DSRV) had been ordered for dispatch from Visakhapatnam Naval Base. These vessels would only offer moderate assistance to the search operations, but, if Nanggala was found submerged, Indonesia would be unable to rescue the crew without this sort of specialised assistance. By Friday evening, Australia announced its contribution. Its frigate Ballarat, equipped with advanced sonar and a helicopter, and the support ship Sirius, able to replenish other vessels, would do more to assist with the search. Early Saturday, a US Navy P- 8 Poseidon, arguably the military kit most capable of locating a lost submarine, arrived to support the operations. No One Nation Can Go It Alone This is a familiar story in the intensely maritime Southeast Asian region. When tragedy strikes at sea, rarely can one nation go it alone. Friends assemble to assist. When AirAsia flight QZ8501 disappeared from radar above the Java Sea in 2014, surface ships, aircraft, and search and rescue experts from more than a dozen countries assembled to support the response. Similar coalitions also developed to search for Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 and to render assistance after natural disasters such as the 2013 Super Typhoon Yolanda and the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Southeast Asian maritime partners also cooperate day-in and day-out in their fight against terrorists, pirates, and other criminals. Coordination is also key to responding to steady-state maritime threats such as the trafficking of humans and illicit goods and the unlawful harvesting of marine resources. Bringing international assets into the fold provides much-needed additional capacity, but also creates additional challenges regarding coordination and management. If the forces are not ready to work together, then the arrival of a foreign ship, aircraft or expert can become a distraction that does more harm than good. Steps Towards Greater Cooperation The search for Nanggala reaffirms the need for the maritime forces of Southeast Asia to continue expanding their cooperative capacity. Such capacity must be based on mutual trust, confidence, and some degree of interoperability. While high-end systems that connect electronically to one another can be incredibly useful, it is the human-to- human element that is most important. The first step toward cooperation is the confidence to ask for help. Then, there is a more technical challenge related to making sure the requests and reciprocal responses are delivered in formats that enable the legal and bureaucratic mechanisms of both partners to quickly make decisions. The early deployment of MV Swift Rescue, suggests that the Indonesian-Singapore relationship was able to work through these steps more quickly than the other bilateral partnerships. Once the forces are on scene, unit commanders must understand each other\u2019s protocols to efficiently cooperate. Such efficiency can only be built upon familiarity developed through practice. Southeast Asia\u2019s Maritime Challenges Southeast Asia\u2019s maritime challenges will not disappear anytime soon. Nefarious actors will continue to undermine safety, conduct illicit activities, and commit crimes against others at sea. Terrible accidents will happen. Southeast Asian states have made tremendous strides to build confidence and interoperability between their maritime forces. However, readiness to executive complex maritime operations is not like riding a bicycle. Proficiency must be maintained through practice and partners can always do better. Therefore, multilateral exercises such as international mechanisms like the ASEAN Defence Ministers Meeting Plus (ADMM-Plus) and Western Pacific Naval Symposium as well as hosted by states, like Indonesia\u2019s Komodo and the US\u2019 SEACAT, are so vitally important. those sponsored by There is a common desire for the officers planning those events to push them toward the \u201chigh-end\u201d and focus on \u201cadvance warfare\u201d tactics. Such pressure is not all bad, but the planners, and those supplying them with policy oversight, should remember that the next time they assemble it will probably not be to conduct combined war-at- sea. More likely, it will be to conduct missions such as counter-terrorism, search and rescue, or disaster response. Including the policymaking and diplomatic participants would be a valuable step forward. There is nothing wrong with training for the most likely scenarios. In fact, the trust and interoperability developed in these constabulary missions are the exact same foundations upon which combined navy warfare operations are built. It will be some time before we have enough information to know if a faster, more able, international response would have made a difference for the crew of KRI Nanggala- 402. But when the Indonesian Navy announced, four days after the sub had gone missing, they had found the boat well below its crush depth; it became clear that more international cooperative measures are needed to deal with such emergencies. In this case, 53 souls onboard were lost."

    "content": "AS THE world battles with the coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations Security Council has not been able to reach agreement on a draft resolution put before it on COVID-19, after nearly two months of difficult negotiations. This draft resolution called for an end to hostilities worldwide so that there could be a full focus on fighting COVID-19, a once-in-a-century pandemic. If passed, it would have given powerful backing to the call for a global ceasefire made earlier by the Secretary-General, to create a \u201chumanitarian pause\u201d and to allow governments to better address the pandemic among the world\u2019s most vulnerable. US Stumbling Block Yet, agreement could not be reached on the resolution in the Security Council because the United States objected the reference to \u201cthe urgent need to support\u2026. all relevant entities of the United Nations system, including specialised health agencies\u201d in the fight against the pandemic. Diplomats were hoping for stronger US leadership in global health security at this historical moment as they had seen in prior epidemics discussed by the Security Council like Ebola and HIV/AIDs. The failure to reach agreement undermines the urgent need for a coordinated global response at a time the world faces an unprecedented crisis and is entering an extremely dangerous period. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about immense human suffering and is having a devastating impact on all our economies, societies and families. The invisible common enemy has already infected over four million people, killed over 280,000 worldwide and exposed the weakest links and fault lines in all societies. The bottom 40 per cent has been hit the hardest. As working from home and social distancing are being implemented everywhere -- for the daily wage workers, the informal and casual workers, migrant workers in construction sites, in the agricultural and food sectors -- working from home means being out of a job. The \u2018New Normal\u2019 Managing COVID-19 has forced borders to close, has disrupted global supply chains, and has destroyed industries and small business that depend on tourism and the movement of people, creating new vulnerability and joblessness on a scale not seen in peace time. In the US alone over 20.6 million people have lost their jobs. Most have limited or no access to affordable healthcare; many have been thrown out of rented accommodations because they have no savings and social protection; homelessness and hunger have become the \u2018new normal\u2019. Many countries and local governments took early and effective action to contain the virus within their own jurisdictions. Some countries and local governments have done better than others in controlling the spread of the COVID-19 and the death rates. There are many reasons: the quality of the health infrastructure; the organisation of the response using a \u201cwhole of government and whole of society approach\u201d; the strengthened outreach of civil society to vulnerable people; the decisiveness and clarity of thinking by leaders based on the evolving scientific knowledge; the social cohesion and level of trust in public institutions and political leadership; the investment in social protection systems and public housing in the society. And most important, those who have addressed inequalities of gender, ethnic, class and political discrimination, and human rights abuses in societies have built greater trust and social capital that have had an enormous impact on the outcome. Need for Global Action and Leadership However national and local actions alone are insufficient. Global action and partnership are vital now to deal with the global pandemic and its aftermath. The world is in need of global leadership and coordinated global responses to an unprecedented global emergency since World War Two. It is precisely at times like this that the leadership of the Security Council is needed. It should not be silent in the face of the serious threat to global peace and security which COVID-19 represents. This is the time for the premier institution responsible for leading on global security to show strength, not weakness. The UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has called for an immediate global ceasefire, in all corners of the world, amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The Secretary- General\u2019s appeal is urgent and well-founded: \u2022 The world faces a common enemy, COVID-19. The virus does not care about nationality or ethnicity, It attacks relentlessly and without faith. discrimination. The pandemic it has caused is having wide-ranging negative impacts around the world. Every country and every nationality are affected. faction or \u2022 Meanwhile, armed conflicts still rage in many parts of the world, and the most vulnerable -- women and children, elderly people, people with disabilities, the marginalised, and the displaced -- continue to pay the highest price. They are also among the groups at greatest the risk of suffering the devastating effects of COVID- 19. \u2022 In war-ravaged countries, health systems have collapsed. Health professionals, already few in number, have been targeted in many current conflicts. Medical supplies and equipment are often scarce. Refugees and others displaced by violent conflict are doubly vulnerable. Time for Pause in Superpower Rivalry A global cessation of hostilities is essential to help create corridors for life-saving humanitarian assistance; to open precious windows for diplomacy, and to bring hope to places among the most vulnerable to COVID-19. It is time to put animosities between superpowers and conflicts on lockdown and to come together to focus on the true fight of our lifetime: the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. As the UN celebrates its 75th Anniversary, there is overwhelming support for international partnership and cooperation to solve global challenges. But the United Nations Security Council must be allowed to do its job and not be hampered by superpower rivalry and politics. The world urgently needs the Security Council to show determination, to support those fighting the pandemic and those who can support global economic recovery, social protection, and peacebuilding in the COVID-19 era."

    "title": "Global Health Security: COVID-19 & Its Impacts EU\u2019s Pandemic Management: Why More Credit Is Due",
    "author(s)": "By Frederick Kliem",
    "date": "No. 098 \u2013 23 June 2021",
    "content": "THE EU \u2500 European Union \u2500 is no stranger to being the scapegoat for pretty much anything that goes wrong in Europe. When the COVID-19 pandemic first hit the continent, the EU\u2019s value-added in times of crisis was questioned once again, and criticism was harsh. A recent study found that Europeans\u2019 trust in EU institutions has decreased substantially over the cause of the pandemic. Despite initial mishaps, this lack of trust is not justified. The EU has proven itself as a slow, but remarkably successful and hands-on crisis manager \u2500 for its members and in support of its global partners. EU Missing in Action Partly because EU bureaucracy can be sluggish and aloof, partly because the EU was caught off-guard, and, most importantly, because health governance rests with the nation states, the EU was virtually absent across the board in the early days of the pandemic. Whenever it did act, such as with vaccine procurement, Brussels looked inept, damaging the EU\u2019s reputation. National governments were left to do as they pleased. Some reacted not at all, others with draconian measures. Many were driven by a short-sighted national self-help instinct. For example, when badly COVID-affected, Italy activated an EU crisis support mechanisms (CPM), it was met with woeful silence. Although this lack of European solidarity was not Brussels\u2019 fault and also immediately rectified, it reflected badly on the EU. Initial European COVID management resembled, as the Commission President called it, a \u201cpainful story\u201d of \u201conly-for-me responses\u201d. But as her predecessor, Jean-Claude Juncker, used to say, when the EU goes through crises, it always emerges stronger from them. Exhibit A: Travel Extremes characterised shockingly uncoordinated European travel restriction measures, ranging from unilateral border closures \u2014 a sensitive topic in Europe \u2014 to laissez-faire approaches to travel, leading to some super-spreader vacations. Following this cacophony, with Brussels\u2019 help, EU members gradually found the right balance between the de jure guaranteed freedom of movement \u2014a fundamental pillar of European regionalism \u2014 and prudent movement controls. The EU is now emerging as a role model for international travel, neither exceedingly cautious nor reckless. Just as is the case in ASEAN, numerous EU countries depend on tourism, some to the tune of 15% to 20% of GDP. Countries such as Spain are now cautiously reopening in order to save their travel industry and the European aviation market in tandem. This is perhaps risky, but an absolute necessity in order to avoid an uneven recovery, which would further increase unhealthy economic asymmetry in Europe, both across sectors and countries. Ultimately, this also symbolises that in Europe, health can never trump other fundamental civil rights for a prolonged period of time. A prudent resumption of international travel is aided by coordinated instruments, such as a mass-testing and vaccination passports, potentially a blueprint for other regions grappling with the pandemic travel dilemma. Exhibit B: Vaccinations With the intent to prevent vaccine nationalism, EU leaders entrusted the Commission with vaccine procurement for the entire bloc. They sought to avoid asymmetric distribution across the EU and to counter the narrative of an ostensibly resurgent European nationalism. Joint procurement proved less efficient as compared to the United States or Britain, and criticism ran wild. Although somewhat unfair, critics had a point: The Commission was inexperienced with large-scale procurement. Negotiators were slow and miserly and failed to secure sufficient and stable vaccine supply. Predictably, supply became the inoculation programme\u2019s bottleneck. For example, by the end of April, Germany had only been able to vaccinate 7.5% of its people, half of Singapore\u2019s rate. Despite the serious consequences of a slow vaccination roll-out, preventing European vaccine nationalism was noble and ultimately successful, on three accounts. First, the EU demonstrated internal solidarity; two, it helped containing transnational infection chains across Europe\u2019s notoriously porous borders; and three, despite the slow start, the EU\u2019s inoculation programme is catching up fast as bottlenecks are loosening: EU-wide, 31% are now fully, 55% partially vaccinated. Germany vaccinates up to 1.4 million people in a single day. Despite some outliers (Malta\u2019s vaccination rate is nearly 70%, Bulgaria\u2019s only 13%), most countries are on par. The EU is expected to even exceed its ambitious target of a 70% inoculation rate by September. Exhibit C: Global Solidarity Just like everyone else, the EU must look after its citizens first. And yet, despite false claims to the contrary, the EU remains the only Western bloc that exports vaccines on a large scale. Granted, Brussels blocked the export of some AstraZeneca doses to Australia when the company failed to fulfil its delivery commitments to the EU, while exporting their product at the same time. But this is an isolated case, and it is worth noting that these vaccines were largely donated to the COVAX Facility, the global coalition to support equitable access to vaccines, to which the EU is collectively one of the largest contributors. Moreover, via its \u201cTeam Europe\u201d initiative, the EU offers substantial pandemic support to partner countries, thus far amounting to some \u20ac40 billion. Over \u20ac800 million of this went to ASEAN in support of regional health infrastructure and technical assistance, paying specific attention to vulnerable and marginalised communities. The EU also supports the WHO Southeast Asia with \u20ac20 million, and Germany alone contributed \u20ac5 million to ASEAN\u2019s COVID Response Fund. From Zero to Hero There are several lessons here: One, perceiving political success in extremes, as either total failure or success, is usually a fallacy; two, anything involving the EU bureaucracy and complex power dynamics between institutions and member states is often slow, risk-averse, and overly complicated. But once it gets going, European regionalism is capable of remarkable progress. Most importantly, EU solidarity is alive. Even under immense pressure, Europe practised internal solidarity and crisis management. Equally important, it offered a counter-narrative to the ostensibly globally resurging nationalism and national \u201cme-first\u201d attitude. The EU demonstrates that international cooperation and mutual support are not lofty values for good weather only."

    "author(s)": "By Nazneen Mohsina",
    "date": "No. 031 \u2013 27 February 2020",
    "content": "THE EVOLVING COVID-19 situation in Singapore has engendered questions about the country\u2019s resilience and social cohesion at a time of heightened stress. The authorities raised the health alert level from Yellow to Orange, the second highest Disease Outbreak Response System Condition level, signalling the spread of the disease was intensifying. This triggered public panic and resulted in distasteful social behaviour. Scores of Singaporeans hoarded rice, instant noodles, and toilet paper, fearing that the country would go into lockdown. Online grocery store Redmart announced it had limited delivery slots due to a sudden 300% surge in demand. NTUC FairPrice, Singapore\u2019s largest supermarket chain\u2019s website temporarily went offline. There was also hoarding and profiteering from the sale of masks and hand sanitisers on online marketplaces. With surgical masks sold out at most pharmacies, scammers online also allegedly sold masks and reneged on orders. Containing Xenophobia & Public Panic Xenophobic remarks about Chinese nationals were already making rounds on the Internet as the virus spread. After the raised health alert, there were also reports of landlords stigmatising and even evicting mainland Chinese tenants who were on quarantine or leave of absence. Some members of the public also shunned healthcare workers from taking public transport, fearing they might contaminate it. Social media platforms were also bombarded with information and misinformation from myriad sources. To allay public anxiety, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong released a recorded message on television and online, assuring Singaporeans that there was no need to panic as the country was not being locked-down, and there were ample supplies of essentials for everyone. He described the outbreak as a test of Singapore\u2019s social cohesion and psychological resilience. He said while \u201cfear and anxiety are natural human reactions\u201d, panic would undermine Singapore\u2019s reputation in the international community and can do more harm than the virus itself. Singapore has no choice but to be extra vigilant and transparent in its fight against COVID-19. The government has implemented a series of measures to reduce the risk of imported cases and community transmission of the deadly disease. Singapore is looking to develop local manufacturing capabilities of masks as export regulations It has established a highly sophisticated contact-tracing tighten elsewhere. mechanism to track every known possible contact of those infected so they can be quarantined or monitored. Defending Public Health According to a study by the Harvard School of Public Health, Singapore has a \u201cgold standard\u201d detection capability. However, the study also notes that Singapore\u2019s detection is \u201cprobably not 100 percent efficient\u201d, and the number of asymptomatic or low-severity cases overlooked is unknown. Singapore also shut its borders to China and has enforced a strict 14-day leave of absence for Chinese nationals returning from the mainland who are permanent residents or have work permits. The country has a zero-tolerance approach to any breaches of the measures it has put in place. People who breach Quarantine Orders stand to be fined. In addition, the Ministry of Manpower has also revoked work passes, repatriated, and barred violators from working in Singapore permanently. Indeed this week, on 28 February, a China couple will be charged for giving false information and obstructing contact tracing, according to the Ministry of Health. In order to keep the public updated on the latest outbreak information and combat rumours and fake news, the government has set up an official page and communication software that provides daily updates to subscribers. The government has also emphasised the ethos of Singapore\u2019s Total Defence policy to highlight how every Singaporean needs to play a part to overcome this national challenge. Total Defence was launched in 1984 as a national defence initiative to rally all citizens behind the Singapore Armed Forces during war. The framework has since evolved to bolster resilience of Singaporeans and address new threats, including non-military adversities such as economic recessions, pandemics, cyber security breaches, and natural disasters. Accordingly, social resilience refers to a society\u2019s ability to collectively tolerate, absorb, cope with, and adjust to threats of various kinds resulting from social, political, and environmental challenges. Singaporeans\u2019 Quiet Civic Spirit The initial panic among some appears to have been contained. Undeniably, despite the negative behaviour, most Singaporeans swiftly adjusted to the outbreak and showed considerable calm and rationality. Singaporeans have not only called out the disgraceful behaviour by some, there are also accounts of them giving out masks and hand sanitizers to fellow citizens, bringing food to people on leave of absence, offering to ferry healthcare workers to and from the hospitals, among other things. There have also been numerous initiatives in the community by charities and social service agencies \u2013 who have mobilised to distribute meals, hand sanitisers and masks to the vulnerable in their community, share important public health messages, rally the community to take ownership and commit to upholding good hygiene practices, and raise funds to support the various efforts towards battling COVID-19. Singapore-based Facebook crowdsourcing platform, StandUpFor.SG invited people to write notes of encouragement for healthcare workers, which the group disseminates to healthcare institutions. Insofar, more than a thousand contributions have come in from the general public, schools and non-profit organisations, including a Valentine's Day card by the Prime Minister. Businesses have also collaborated with the group to make the initiative a success. Additionally, many unions and organisations gave out care-packages to workers on the frontline of Singapore's efforts against the ongoing threat. AIA Singapore announced offered free additional coverage for all its existing customers, employees and tied representatives. Businesses have also stepped up precautionary and business continuity measures to mitigate the risk of a spread. Going Forward The Government has set up a centralised platform to coordinate and convene the various ground-up efforts \u2013 and urged Singapore to continue acting as a community and turn fears and anxieties into concrete action to contribute in the fight against the epidemic. To conclude, Singapore has displayed rather sturdy social resilience during this crisis. While the deplorable behaviour of some Singaporeans cannot be denied or condoned, some argue that Singaporeans might have coped better if information was disseminated in a more timely manner by the authorities at the initial stage. Specifically, if the orange alert news was communicated with clearer and timelier explanation, Singaporeans might have been better prepared psychologically and acted appropriately. People were unsure about the meaning of the various colour- coded alerts and how they translate into practice \u2013 especially as they watched and compared how the COVID-19 situation was unfolding in other countries. This could explain the relative calm that followed the response and assurances from the government later. As Professor Tommy Koh reiterated, Singapore has historically proven to be able to withstand major crises. If it continues to remain cohesive and resilient, it can overcome the COVID-19 pandemic, too."

    "title": "Can Cities Become Sustainable?",
    "author(s)": "By Victor R Savage",
    "date": "No. 035 \u2013 5 March 2020",
    "content": "CITIES ARE cultural creations. As Anne Spirn the prize-winning American landscape architect argues, current cities are \u201cgranite gardens\u201d, devoid of self-sustaining ecological life. Furthermore, the human specimen is the dominant species, which unfortunately, armed with economic desires, political ambitions, and cultural egoism, creates a lethal mix for ecological domination. Given that Asia was the birth place of cities in the Middle East and Mohenjo Daro some 8,000 years ago, are there lessons one can learn from the proto-historic Asian urban experience? Why Cities Are Not Sustainable Cities are efficient spatial entities given that half the world\u2019s population resides on one percent of the earth\u2019s total land mass. But the other side of the story is that urban residents are liberal and wasteful users of resources. They consume 65 percent of the world\u2019s food and natural resources. Unfortunately, cities are no more dependent on their immediate hinterlands. Affluence and technology have freed former space-bound societies. Global cities like Tokyo, Mumbai, Shanghai and Singapore have almost carte blanche access to global hinterlands. In Asia, the focus of unsustainable cities reflects much broader issues. Firstly, it is not the size of population that is gobbling up natural resources, but the inequality of wealth. One has become used to the mantras that greed, conspicuous consumption, waste, affluence and capitalism are the source of many of Gaia\u2019s problems of environmental degradation. The French economist, Thomas Picketty provides a sober prognosis on the serial inequality of wealth in capitalism. Capitalism results in the popular dictum that the rich get richer and the poor, poorer. Capitalism needs to be moderated, modified and better managed to ensure more sustainable living. Whatever criticisms one levels at the Chinese authoritarian system of capitalism, objectively one cannot deny the country has produced spectacular results in lifting 80 percent of its peoples out of abject poverty. Challenges of Weather Changes Secondly, as recipients of massive labour migrants and environmental refugees are cruel signals that many states are failures in sustainability. Developing countries need to place more effort in developing non-urban areas. Where precipitation is lacking, large water systems need to be put in place to invigorate agriculture like in Israel and the Gobi desert in China. Thirdly, cities, built in the past for smaller populations cannot cope with environmental refugees. Many of Asia\u2019s mega-cities (cities over 10 million population) have urban infrastructures (housing, public health, environmental issues) which are unable to handle its growing large populations. Housing needs to be given priority attention in Asia\u2019s cities to thwart slum and squatter developments, enhance public hygiene, increase the quality of life, and diffuse potential political disturbances like the recent Hong Kong protests. Fourthly, new intense rainfall levels resulting from La Nina and climate change need to be addressed periodically. Singapore\u2019s periodic flooding in Orchard Road and Bukit Timah in the 1990s demonstrated that weather changes are challenging former infrastructural developments. The Singapore authorities finally admitted flooding resulted because the former infrastructure (drainage facilities) was not built for the intense, large surges of precipitation. El Ni\u00f1o-La Ni\u00f1a: Impacts and Responses Climate change is often touted as the catalyst for current environmental problems but in reality the cause is El Ni\u00f1o-La Ni\u00f1a. Tim Flannery, the Australian scientist, calls the"

    "author(s)": "By Adam Garfinkle",
    "date": "No. 113 \u2013 8 June 2020",
    "content": "THE EXISTENTIAL fact of George Floyd\u2019s killing at the hands of a policeman in Minneapolis, Minnesota on 25 May 2020 is less consequential than the ensemble of reactions to it now in motion. How is the ongoing social unrest likely to affect American power, policy and reputation in the world at large? Three questions about its impact point to what is most important: First, how will the unrest affect the November presidential election? Second, how will the unrest, and specifically President Trump\u2019s reaction to it, affect military morale? Third, how will the unrest, coming on top of the evolving COVID-19 challenge, affect public views of the still operative, but eroded, US role as key provider of common global security goods? The Politics of Social Unrest The common wisdom on the political impact of American social unrest holds that peaceful protests help liberal Democrats and riots help \u201claw-and-order\u201d Republicans. This is basically correct: The legitimacy and even the nobility of peaceful protest and dissent is baked into the American concept of free political speech based on conscience; violent protest, on the other hand, whether deemed justified in the circumstance or not, tends to mobilise nervous but otherwise passive voters in favour of politically reactionary and socially narrowing agendas. That, it is now popularly averred, is what happened in the 1967-68 period, and may happen again. Trump apparently thinks so; his unsubtle Nixonian reaction so far gives every indication of being a deliberate effort to stoke conflict so that he can harvest the political fallout. Trump may or may not be rewarded for his efforts. The 1968 analogy is by no means airtight for several reasons, so it remains to be seen how effective Trump\u2019s \u201claw-and- order\u201d campaign posture will be in November. It is a posture he will pursue in tandem with a \u201cblame China\u201d strategy to distract memory of his COVID-19 response mismanagement. Unless the unrest persists for several more months, which is unlikely, by the election it will have become just another partisan lightning-rod issue. Disentangling the inevitable multiple factors determining election results will be, as always, difficult and inconclusive. But one thing is certain: The election will have a major impact on future US foreign and national security policy. If Trump is re-elected, four more years of his isolationist- unilateralist instincts will have destroyed what remains of US postwar grand strategy, and with it all of the multilateral institutions raised over the decades to support it. If the Democrats win, policy will not revert to the status quo ante before the Obama Administration\u2019s more hesitant and much differently toned movement away from that grand strategy. A Biden Administration, however, will restore many benign traditions and attitudes in dealing with other nations as it works its way toward a new, and hopefully apt, strategic concept. Military Morale President Trump\u2019s use of military force to disperse protesters in front of the White House so that he could stage a wordless campaign photo-op, upside-down Bible in hand in front of the historic St. John\u2019s Episcopal Church, was outrageous on so many levels that one hardly knows where to begin. Republican Senator Tom Cotton\u2019s tweet, calling on the White House to invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act and give \u201cno quarter\u201d to protesters, was even worse: He basically advocated the commission of war crimes by US troops against US citizens on US soil. But Senator Cotton is merely aiming to replace Mark Esper as Secretary of Defence, so will say anything without the constraint of scruples to win the president\u2019s confidence. Neither Trump nor Cotton has apparently given any thought to what such actions do to military morale, including among US troops deployed overseas in harm\u2019s way. The US military has been a major institutional tool for advancing racial harmony and justice in the United States since at least 1948. People of every race, religion, and ethnic origin are numbered among those in the uniformed services. The spectre of American soldiers shooting and killing unarmed peaceful protesters without even a pretence of due process -- that is what \u201cno quarter\u201d means -- in a racially charged situation would severely undermine morale throughout the military. America\u2019s adversaries could not possibly fail to notice. That is why Secretary Esper has come out against implementing the Insurrection Act, a display of integrity that may soon get him fired. He has been joined by Generals James Mattis, Mike Mullen, and dozens of other retired and active-duty flag officers. Will that firm response from the military stop the president from again ordering US soldiers to do things they should never be ordered to do? We\u2019re bound to find out. Isolationism and Virtue The current unrest in the US, which is being deliberately exacerbated by opportunists on both the radical \u201cantifa\u201d Left and the radical white-supremacist Right, is clearly deepening the turn of opinion away from active and constructive US engagement in global affairs. As was not the case during the final decade of the 20th century, Americans today increasingly see expansive international engagement as too expensive, too dangerous, too complex to understand, and unhelpful either to the \u201cmain street\u201d American economy or to rock-bottom American security. something much more profound But is going on. The Protestant/Enlightenment DNA baked indelibly into the American personality requires a belief in the nation\u2019s exceptionalist virtue to justify an activist role abroad. Unlike most historic great powers, security and commercial interests alone do not suffice to"

    "title": "AI Governance & Military Affairs Artificial Intelligence and Arms Control: What it Means for Singapore",
    "author(s)": "By Andrea Gilli and Mauro Gilli",
    "date": "No. 200 \u2013 23 November 2020",
    "content": "MASSIVE AND rapid progress in so-called emerging and disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence is generating global concerns because, while countries invest in R&D, their armed forces aim to integrate such technologies in their force structures. As individual services experiment with the new technologies and develop new operational concepts and warfighting doctrines, new questions on the future of arms control emerge. Can arms control play a role in the governance of artificial intelligence? If so, how? Killer Robots, Arms Control and Artificial Intelligence The issue of arms control and artificial intelligence, especially in Europe, is often linked to the decade-old campaign to ban lethal autonomous weapons (LAWs) or so-called killer robots. While progress on this front has been limited and a preventive ban, as the campaign aims to achieve, seems unlikely at this stage, arms control can still provide a significant contribution. However, arms control must be entrenched into a strategic logic: as a means, it must serve some goals. The challenge is thus squaring the circle, having countries with different goals agreeing on the means. For instance, do countries aim to achieve strategic stability, i.e., reduce the risks of unintended escalations? Or do some of them want to preserve their competitive advantage, e.g., withhold some critical technologies from adversaries? Self-evidently, these two options are at odds, and reconciling them is not easy at all: it was possible during the Cold War, but it is not given that it will happen again. Indeed, the multilateral arms control architecture is weakening. Alternatively, countries may pursue non-proliferation to create a club and regulate access to some critical technologies, in part like the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The Three AI Pillars & Arms Control To understand how arms control can contribute to artificial intelligence, it is imperative to understand the relationship between its three elements: algorithms, data and hardware. Algorithms There are fundamentally two types of algorithms: Generic, developed by the commercial world, which serves multiple purposes and can be reprogrammed. Realistically, trying to regulate their diffusion would be ineffective let alone inefficient as this would negatively affect the workforce in the private industry, its incentives to invest as well as government-industry relations. Specific algorithms are designed for targeted missions, in the military domain, but also in the private industry, like in advanced manufacturing processes \u2013 such as semiconductors. Regulating and controlling their diffusion is easier and more effective. On the one hand, in some countries, their sales are already under government supervision (like the Commerce Department\u2019s Munition List in the US). On the other, since these algorithms are much more challenging to develop, few actors control this technology, and thus they represent critical chokepoints in the supply chain, which countries can strategically exploit for arms control. Data If data is the new oil, it is useless without drilling plans (sensors) refineries (data scientists), and pipelines (data infrastructures). Unsurprisingly, there is not a single case of people, or countries, becoming rich thanks to raw data. From an arms control perspective, not all data is the same. Fundamentally, there are two types of data. Training datasets, on which algorithms are perfected, and data analytics or the data generated during operations that the algorithms exploit to improve performance. The latter type of data is not really an arms control issue but relates more to privacy and security issues. Training datasets can, in contrast, be subjected to arms control agreements. Like algorithms, general training datasets are difficult to monitor and thus any technology control regime is difficult to enforce. Highly specific training datasets are easier to monitor and, in some cases, already subjected to export restrictions. The current artificial intelligence paradigm is built on large datasets, mostly because data is cheap. However, should an industrial inflection point occur, in which software accuracy becomes a dominant standard, the role and importance of data would progressively evaporate. Hardware The last pillar of artificial intelligence concerns computing power, which mostly translates into semiconductors. In this respect, three considerations are in order. Because of the 1965 Moore\u2019s Law, the power of microprocessors has increased continuously over the past decades, doubling every 12 months. Simultaneously, however, because of the Second Moore\u2019s Law, the cost of semiconductor production plants has also constantly increased, doubling every four years and thus leading to an extremely concentrated industry, which has also adopted global structure. This trend has several implications for arms control. Few companies produce leading semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME). Technology control agreements can thus be put in place in this realm. Not all countries can produce the most advanced semiconductors. The advantages of export control regimes depend in this case, however, on the relative performance curves of industry leaders and followers. Some believe tight control regimes will undermine the oligopolistic structure of the industry, while others are more sceptical. In the background, there is the question of the end of Moore\u2019s Law. As artificial intelligence requires more and more parallelised chips to conduct multiple operations, it is likely that for many applications, they will be too expensive, thus leading to a dramatic change of the industry \u2013 whose consequences are difficult to anticipate. What It Means for Singapore The AI-centered technological revolution we are witnessing, moving away from some traditional features of the industrial age \u2013 such as economies of scale \u2013 is probably going to strengthen, at the global level, small, knowledge-intensive countries. Singapore is a leading hub for technological innovation and technological adoption. The country has an established reputation in these domains. Geopolitics is not going to disappear overnight, however. For a country like Singapore, similar to Switzerland in Europe, a strong multilateral system of arms control and technology export regime could probably be of interest \u2013 as the country has much to gain from international stability and global trade. As discussions grow in different corners of the world about what type of arms control regime to pursue, and what countries to include, Singapore has a strong interest at stake as a producer of some key advanced technologies."

    "author(s)": "By Abdul Basit",
    "date": "No. 120 \u2013 12 June 2020",
    "content": "TERRORISM IS communicative violence that draws attention to perpetrating groups\u2019 ideological narratives. Beyond the terrorist outfits\u2019 use of the violence to kill or maim, there is their need to highlight their political grievances and demands through intimidation. Yet, the empirical data indicates that majority of the terrorist attacks go unclaimed; only one in seven attacks is claimed by the terrorist groups. Attacks are claimed if the expected political outcomes are positive and vice versa. In May, two high-profile attacks in Afghanistan targeting a maternity hospital in Kabul and a mosque in central Parwan province went unclaimed. Though the Afghan government blamed the Taliban, the group has denied responsibility. Contrary to the Afghan government\u2019s allegations, the US blamed the Islamic State of Khorasan (ISK) for the attack. Why Some Attacks Remain Claimed The terrorist groups are less likely to claim attacks which target the civilians ahead of major political developments such as ceasefire agreements or peace negotiations. Indiscriminate violence against civilians carries more political risks as compared to selective violence against military targets. Currently, the Taliban are engaged in the campaign of winning the hearts and minds in Afghanistan as part of their political propaganda against the Afghan government. Alongside discrediting the government, the insurgent group is mindful of avoiding civilian casualties. Since 2006, barring its fighters from harming civilians has been at the heart of different Laheya (codes of conduct) issued by the Taliban leadership. In 2011 and 2013, the Taliban respectively formed a committee and a commission to mitigate the harm to civilians brought about by group\u2019s operations. In 2017, both these entities were merged into the commission for the Prevention of Civilian Casualties and Inquiry of Complains (PCCIC). Principal-Agent Problem Organisationally, the anonymous claims constitute the principal-agent problem where some level of disconnect exists between the top leaders of terrorist groups and their subordinates. Despite its organisational coherence and exemplary discipline as a formidable fighting force, the Taliban movement is fraught with internal divisions. The February deal with the US in Qatar has further deepened these divisions. For instance, ahead of the intra-Afghan peace process, the demotion and replacement of hardline military commander Sadar Ibrahim with Mullah Yaqoob, the son of Taliban\u2019s founding leader Mullah Omar, as the head of group\u2019s military wing exposes the militant movement\u2019s internal cracks."

    "title": "China\u2019s Central Bank Digital Currency: What It Means for ASEAN",
    "author(s)": "By Dipinder S Randhawa",
    "date": "No. 214 \u2013 29 December 2020",
    "content": "THE COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the speed at which the definition of money is being transformed by private digital currencies. Beyond the domain of central banks, a new cohort of private-sector agents, including social media companies (Facebook), issuing e-commerce cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin and Ethereum) are actively engaged in creating digital currencies. The pandemic resulted in a rapid shift from cash to online shopping and payments using digital currencies that have grown enormously in volume and diversity. (Alibaba, Tencent), and peer-to-peer networks firms Such digital currencies raised concerns about government-issued currency being challenged by private digital currencies. For example, Libra \u2013 offered by Facebook which has a client base of over 2.7 billion users \u2013 could eventually pose serious threats to central banks\u2019 monetary management. The growing risk of cyber attacks disrupting the payment systems, and overseas digital currencies potentially displacing domestic currencies, have all underpinned the urgency for countries to evaluate the feasibility of issuing digital currencies through their central banks (CBDC). The PBOC\u2019s CBDC The Chinese government and the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) consider internationalising the yuan an important objective as China grows stronger economically. In April 2020, the PBOC became one of the first major central banks to conduct a trial run of its Digital Currency/Electronic Payment (DCEP) in four Chinese cities, with plans to expand the tests to major metropolises. The project was fast-tracked in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike many other CBDCs under consideration, whose use will be confined to wholesale transactions between financial institutions and the central bank, the DCEP will be a retail digital currency issued through banks and payment service providers to individual digital wallets approved by the PBOC. It will allow users to transact online or offline without bank accounts. Structured as a replacement for cash, the DCEP is a centralised, government-issued, universally accessible digital fiat currency, the converse of a Bitcoin. The DCEP is structured to meet several strategic economic and political goals of the Chinese government. It is programmable, and consequently transactions can be completely monitored and recorded in government ledgers. The PBOC may be also concerned about the overwhelming dominance of the two major private sector players, AliPay and WeChat Pay that handle 93 per cent of mobile payments in China. A failure of their networks could result in serious instability, jeopardising the health of the financial system. DCEP and ASEAN As China gains economic strength, the PBOC will aim to internationalise the yuan to reduce the dominance of the US dollar as reserve currency. Since 2016, when the IMF included the yuan in its special drawing rights (SDR) basket as an official reserve currency, the yuan has achieved some, albeit, limited progress in gaining acceptance. By the end of June 2020, two per cent of total reserves were denominated in the yuan, compared to 62 per cent in the US dollar. Deeply connected with China\u2019s economy through trade, investment, travel and people- to-people links, ASEAN may be the first region to drive international usage of the e- yuan. By mid-2020 ASEAN had become China\u2019s biggest trading partner. Can China use its deepening economic engagement and growing clout to pressure Southeast Asian entities to use the yuan for transactions in trade? China's sheer weight in international trade will encourage the use of the DCEP by overseas businesses and countries. While most ASEAN trade with China is denominated in US dollar, the role of the yuan in the region and beyond is increasing. China can deploy numerous levers to expand the use of the e-yuan, including through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) which invests in more than 68 countries, and by encouraging yuan-denominated lending at the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). The PBOC is pushing for a shift from the West-dominated SWIFT system to China\u2019s own Cross-Border Interbank Payments-System (CIPS) for settlements. A digital yuan will allow China to bypass sanctions, enabling users to avoid the scrutiny of the SWIFT system that monitors cash flows on behalf of Western law enforcement and international agencies. Oil exports from Russia, Iran, and Venezuela can be paid in the DCEP, thus circumventing US sanctions. Four Constraints on Yuan Internationalisation However, four factors can constrain the internationalisation of the yuan: \u2022 The yuan\u2019s acceptance as a reserve currency will depend on trust and confidence placed on the currency. Trust is shaped by the currency\u2019s stability and track record over time, especially during periods of turbulence. So far, during periods of stress, the Chinese government has tended to revert to an interventionist mode with capital and currency controls, which will dissuade transactions or reserve holdings in the yuan. \u2022 Prospects for internationalisation will be shaped by the liquidity and depth of China\u2019s financial and capital markets, and the availability of financial instruments to hedge against currency and other risks. On these counts, although financial markets are growing rapidly in China, the yuan is not just behind the US dollar, but some other hard currencies as well. Global players in ASEAN, be they multinationals, international portfolio investors, or banks, expect to operate in a multi-currency environment with easy access to liquid, global currencies. \u2022 Prospects for the yuan will be brighter when there is stability and economic growth. However, enduring geopolitical concerns including anxiety about China\u2019s aggressive postures in the South China Sea, and other strained bilateral relationships; the tensions with Taiwan, and the US-China trade war, will deter investors from considering yuan. \u2022 The programmable nature of DCEP and complete loss of privacy, coupled with the ability of the PBOC to monitor and control the end use of money may be a deterrent for market participants considering the DCEP. ASEAN\u2019s Options To maintain autonomy in its choice of currency for international trade and finance, ASEAN needs to scale up collaboration among its members. The ASEAN Digital Integration Framework (ASEAN DIF), integral to the ASEAN Economic Community 2025 blueprint could provide a platform for enhanced discussions on initiatives for safeguarding financial stability. To address the challenges arising from DCEP, ASEAN finance ministers and central banks could consider establishing a region-wide platform encompassing common global standards and protocols that will enable ASEAN to interface with digital currencies developed elsewhere in the world, including the DCEP. Since ASEAN trades actively with other economic powers including the European Union, the United States, Japan, and South Korea, the need for competitiveness and autonomy would suggest that ASEAN maintain flexibility in its choice of currency usage. Most large businesses are diversified across several regions. They will have a strong preference for hard currencies and the lower risk and fungibility they offer in global markets. In the long-term, when the DCEP has acquired a track record and gained public confidence, it will undoubtedly gain traction in global trade and finance. In the interim, the US dollar will remain dominant in international transactions. Ultimately, the risk associated with holding the yuan as opposed to the US dollar will shape decisions."

    "author(s)": "By Victor R Savage",
    "date": "No. 125 \u2013 18 June 2020",
    "content": "THE RAPID rise of China is a cause of global political discomfort given its cultural differences with the west, its authoritarian system, and its control of what the Harvard professor Shoshana Zuboff calls \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d \u0336  a surveillance-based economic order. The trepidations over China reflect what the US professor of journalism Howard French refers to as the Chinese concept of \u201ctian xia\u201d or \u201ceverything under the heavens\u201d. Honed over 4,000 years, tian xia, underscored China\u2019s central pivot in the cosmos, ensured its leadership was paramount amongst other states, and provided a smug racial endorsement of its cultural egotism. Celestial Empire\u2019s Rise: The Tian Xia Worldview Throwing out Deng Xiaoping\u2019s caution to go slow on revealing China\u2019s economic prowess, President Xi Jinping wanted to define himself as the national leader and the initiator of the \u2018China turn\u2019. To be fair, Trump is not the only one blaming China for taking economic advantage of the United States but also past US presidential administrations. Leaders in small countries might cringe at Trump\u2019s twitter messages, but applaud his political boldness in taking on China and other regional hegemons. The most potent force of power has ironically been in an almost invisible virus, COVID- 19 While several countries \u0336 \u0336  Russia, China, US, and Israel \u0336  have been secretly experimenting with biological warfare in laboratories, COVID-19 has blown their cover. No country anticipated the rapid damage the viral infection could cause \u0336 globally eight million infections, over 449,000 deaths to date within five months. COVID-19: The Game Changer in Globalisation COVID-19 taught us the real meaning of globalisation and how interrelated our world has become. No event, not even the 20th century World Wars, has had such a profound and devastating impact on global movements, the shut-down of economic and social activities, and the stopping of air travel. Global capitalism has been muzzled. COVID-19 undergirds what the Financial Times said \u0336 that democratic liberal politics is dead globally. When Italy was going through its darkest hour with the pandemic and called out to its European Union members for help, not one single member came to its aid. Ironically, China gave it liberal support in supplies and medical personnel. COVID-19 showed the ultimate sacrifice governments are willing to make. Short of medical supplies, Italian doctors practised \u201ctriage\u201d on COVID-19 patients by withholding medical aid for patients over 60 years. Once again COVID-19 brought the US and China to a renewal of fiery accusations, with collateral damage on the World Health Organisation (WHO). Given the US domestic situation, with 40 million unemployed, the slate of bankruptcies, rancid race relations, riots in over 350 cities, and the inept administrative measures in controlling the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, Steve Bannon might be grossly off the mark by making \u2018China\u2019 Trump\u2019s main election issue. Americans see Trump\u2019s China issue as a storm in a tea-cup. Post COVID-19 World: What Will It Look Like? Geopolitically, the post COVID-19 world will become more fragmented. With a US$25 trillion in debt, America is in no position to be a global humanitarian benefactor and global policeman. One wonders if the heir apparent hegemon, China will fill the US shoes. China after all, has tried to show a softer side of its diplomatic statecraft during the COVID-19 pandemic. Beijing liberally donated millions of masks and other medical supplies as well as medical support personnel (nurses, doctors) to over 100 countries. In response to Trump\u2019s criticisms that China gives only $40 million as against America\u2019s $893 million (15 percent of WHO\u2019s budget) contribution to the WHO annually, the Xi administration responded with a $2 billion donation. Unfortunately, COVID-19 opens Pandora\u2019s Box on future options for conflict. The danger of such biological viruses falling in suicidal terrorists\u2019 hands could spell unsurmountable and irreversible damage on states. West Living a Lie About Health Systems While North Korea had been blackmailing Western powers with its nuclear power potential, COVID-19 has shown the world the hermit kingdom was frightened by the invisible virus; Kim has probably new ideas for leveraging power. COVID-19 demonstrates western countries were living a lie that their national health systems were impeccable. While Trump is blaming China and the WHO for the US\u2019 pandemic woes, his criticisms should be directed at himself for misreading the serious situation and the unprepared of the US health services. Despite the mantras that COVID-19 will usher in radical economic and social change, pessimists say life will continue in the same way in a post COVID-19 world. The unfolding of climate change, will unfortunately have a more devastating global impact. Like COVID-19 few countries and leaders are prepared for this life-threatening global catastrophe. The tragedy is climate change spinning rapidly out of control, an answer to the Thucydides trap might be up in the air. Which Hegemon will Rise? While French economist Thomas Picketty notes wars and major global calamities bring inequality to ground zero, the coronavirus pandemic has generated mixed signals. The question is which hegemon has the national resilience to come back in a stronger state? Former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew has marvelled at the American ability to bounce back from a crisis. Is the current US economic crisis, its racial war, its political split between two warring political parties, an indication of the finality of its global hegemonic status as some political pundits predict? On the other hand, is China, a yet to be tested hegemon, a state with pent-up national desires and burning ambitions, rearing to claim the mantle as global hegemon? Ironically, both Xi and Trump are catalysts for each other\u2019s foreign policy initiatives. Hence, in representing the angst of small countries, Singapore\u2019s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong made an impassioned appeal to both hegemons. In his 4 June 2020 Foreign Affairs article, he urged the two powers to understand the reality of the geopolitical situation on the ground, relinquish thoughts of operating on a zero-sum game, and leave room for trust in competition and cooperation in various areas, for the sake of global harmony."

    "title": "Price Of Political Will: The Fall of Two Regimes",
    "author(s)": "By Barry Desker",
    "date": "No. 126 \u2013 20 August 2021",
    "content": "AS THE rapid collapse of the Afghan government played out on television over the past few days, I was riveted by the images of the Taleban advance and the scenes of panic and desperation in Kabul. It made me recall the Khmer Rouge conquest of Phnom Penh and the fall of Saigon in April 1975. People crowded North Vietnamese Army tanks taking position near the presidential palace in Saigon, following a last-ditch battle, on 30 April 1975. As I wondered how Afghanistan's neighbours who had supported the American ouster of the Taleban were reacting to events in Kabul, I was reminded of my own reactions at Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in April 1975 as we followed developments in Indochina. It was a chaotic period. Veteran diplomat Lee Chiong Giam and I were then senior officers handling Southeast Asian affairs and we were having only two to three hours of sleep each night as the rapidly changing situation necessitated frequent updates. Collapse of Political Will At the time, then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew was headed for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Kingston, Jamaica (30 June-6 May) before making his way to the United States for a state visit hosted by President Gerald Ford. With the rapid collapse of the South Vietnamese and Cambodian governments, this visit provided a major opportunity to obtain a reading of American thinking as well as the reactions of leaders from a range of Commonwealth countries. American forces had withdrawn from Vietnam after the Paris Peace Accords of January 1973. A few months later, the US Congress passed the Case-Church Amendment to a Bill funding the State Department for the new fiscal year. The amendment officially ended American military involvement in Vietnam by prohibiting any funding for bombing in Cambodia and any military action in Indochina. Although the war continued for nearly two years, Phnom Penh fell to the Khmer Rouge on 17 April 1975. The 1975 spring offensive by the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) saw it sweep the south and capture Saigon on 30 April. It took all of 55 days. Just like Afghanistan, there was a collapse of political will and the South Vietnamese army retreated or surrendered, although it was better equipped than the North Vietnamese forces. ASEAN Response Singapore had closed its embassy in Phnom Penh and evacuated our staff on the last Royal Australian Air Force flight, which flew out the remaining Australian and New Zealand diplomats as the Khmer Rouge were poised to enter the city. The ASEAN diplomats from Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand stayed on in Phnom Penh and had tried to influence our diplomats to remain. Indonesia had close ties to the collapsing Cambodian junta and the Indonesian army had sent a contingent to Cambodia after the 1971 Jakarta Conference on Cambodia. Thailand was the third largest provider of ground forces in Vietnam, after the US and South Korea, and the Philippines had a contingent in Vietnam. US bases in U Tapao in Thailand and Clark in the Philippines were major staging points for US air force deployments in Indochina. By contrast, although Singapore had recognised the Lon Nol government after the 1970 coup in Cambodia, Singapore enjoyed close relations with the ousted Prince Sihanouk. As Singapore did not have a resident embassy in either Hanoi or Saigon, we did not have to worry about evacuating embassy staff from Saigon. In these circumstances, Singapore citizens were advised to leave South Vietnam when the PAVN advanced southwards but there were no systems then in place to assist Singaporeans who needed to be evacuated. Tussle Over Diplomatic Recognition One common feature in both the Afghan and Vietnamese cases is that just as American policymakers asserted that Kabul could be held by President Ashraf Ghani's government even as provincial capitals capitulated before the Taleban onslaught, the Americans claimed that a ring of steel was being created by the South Vietnamese army around Saigon. In both cases, they were oblivious to the reality that as the defenders saw their commanders' families fleeing abroad and as supplies and rations disappeared, these ground personnel melted into the crowd or returned to their families. Such optimism led to political miscalculations by the US and its allies in both cases. There was insufficient time for a planned withdrawal, especially for local partners. Hasty helicopter departures occurred, which is the abiding memory of the US exit from Saigon, just as videos of Afghans clinging to departing American military aircraft would haunt the current US administration. The change of regimes raised the issue of diplomatic recognition of the new governments, a challenge which Afghanistan's neighbours face today, just as the ASEAN states were confronted with this dilemma in 1975. When Phnom Penh fell on 17 April, Thailand pushed the other ASEAN members for joint recognition of the new Khmer Rouge regime by 0700 hours (Bangkok time) the following morning. All the ASEAN members agreed. The Thai Foreign Ministry made a similar proposal on the night of 30 April for joint ASEAN recognition of the Provisional Revolutionary Government (PRG) of South Vietnam. ASEAN\u2019s Dilemma In the days before mobile phones, Chiong Giam and I went to then Foreign Minister S. Rajaratnam's home after midnight to discuss how to proceed. Mr Rajaratnam was firm that ASEAN should not be seen as panicking or fearful. He opposed immediate recognition of the PRG, which was a political fiction. A contest of wills was beginning in the region and ASEAN should not be seen as caving in. All five ASEAN states already had diplomatic relations with the Hanoi-based Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Singapore's decision resulted in the ASEAN states not proceeding with the Thai proposal. As other countries which had diplomatic relations with the Saigon-based Republic of Vietnam did not switch their recognition to the PRG, Vietnam eventually pushed for unification as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and submitted a single application for membership of the United Nations, which was supported by all the ASEAN states. Before its overthrow in December 2001, the previous Taleban government was recognised by only a handful of states \u2500 Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Today, Russia and China appear to be moving towards diplomatic recognition of the new Taleban government while Pakistan can be expected to act quickly on this issue. Several governments had already initiated contact with the Taleban, including Indonesia. A Taleban delegation led by its co-founder and deputy head Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar visited Indonesia for meetings with Indonesian government leaders in July, after the Indonesian foreign minister Retno Marsudi met Baradar in Qatar in May this year. Taleban\u2019s Charm Offensive The Taleban\u2019s diplomatic charm offensive accompanying the takeover of Kabul will result in more states recognising the new government as it downplays its earlier record of supporting Al-Qaeda, ignoring the rights of women and children, engaging in the manufacture of narcotic drugs and other human rights violations. Afghanistan's neighbours including Uzbekistan and Tajikistan will be pressured to follow if more states recognise the new government. Despite the likely momentum to accept the new leaders in Kabul, there will be lingering fears about the Taleban. Its spokesmen have made various assurances about the rights of women and not exporting terrorism. Still, concerns remain that as the dust settles the Taleban would become once again an exporter of hardline salafi doctrines and a safe haven for radical Islam, with far- reaching impact on the immediate neighbourhood and beyond. Despite Southeast Asia's trauma in the 1970s, the region overcame the odds and has fared better than we would have imagined during those harrowing days of the fall of Saigon and Phnom Penh. The script for Afghanistan's next chapter has barely begun to be written. The hope is that it too would turn out better than expected."

    "title": "UK Elections: Jeremy Corbyn, Anti-Semitism, & Islamophobia",
    "author(s)": "By Paul Hedges and Luca Farrow",
    "date": "No. 002 \u2013 2 January 2020",
    "content": "ON 12 DECEMBER 2019, the United Kingdom had a general election (\u201cGE19\u201d), its third in a little over five years. Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party won 43.6% of the vote, up only 1.2% on Theresa May\u2019s 2017 result. But with a Labour Party collapse (from 40% to 32.1%) Johnson attained a resounding majority, winning 365 out of 650 seats in the House of Commons. The leader of Labour, Jeremy Corbyn, was a surprise winner of the party\u2019s leadership contest in 2015, being perceived as far left after Tony Blair led the party to the centre ground in the 1990s. The reasons for Labour\u2019s loss are manifold. Strong Conservative Party messaging, and media focus, on Brexit was important. But, trust and truthfulness was a widespread issue in the election, and trust in Corbyn is low among the wider British public. Connected to this, allegations of rising Anti-Semitism in Labour under Corbyn\u2019s leadership and allegations that Corbyn is personally Anti-Semitic have been prominent in UK political discourse in recent years. Given that one poll found 39% of the British public generally think Corbyn is Anti-Semitic, we can speculate that the Anti-Semitism storm played a role in Labour\u2019s defeat as part of the reason many were suspicious of him. Investigations and Political Point-Scoring Allegations of religious prejudice were used for political point-scoring in the election campaign. This was evident during a live heated clash between Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and shadow Transport Secretary Andy McDonald. McDonald criticised the Conservative Party for failing to act on the recommendation of Baroness Sayeeda Warsi to launch an independent inquiry into Islamophobia in the Party; even the Conservative Party leader has been dogged by allegations of Islamophobic comments. Raab countered that only Labour and the very far right British National Party have been investigated by the UK Equality and Human Rights Commission (\u201cEHRC\u201d). In May 2019, the EHRC launched a formal investigation into the Labour Party on suspicion that Labour had unlawfully discriminated against Jews because of their ethnicity and religious beliefs. This followed a 2016 internal Labour Party inquiry conducted by senior human rights lawyer Shami Chakrabarti. Chakrabarti found that there was a visible Anti-Semitism problem in the party but that it was not \u201cendemic\u201d. Some criticised the Chakrabarti report as a whitewash, particularly when Chakrabarti was awarded a peerage by Corbyn within months. But its findings were also welcomed by some who submitted evidence to the inquiry. Whether or not Anti-Semitism has been weaponised for political gain, it is a very real issue for British Jews. The anxiety felt by some Jews at the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister was real. On 26 November, Chief Rabbi of the Orthodox community, Ephraim Mirvis, accused Corbyn of allowing a \u201cpoison\u201d to take root in the Labour Party. Though other Jews refute such claims as politically motivated. This partly relates to the way that criticism of Israel can be conflated with Anti-Semitism. The New Anti-Semitism Allegations of Labour Anti-Semitism relate to the so-called New Anti-Semitism. Whereas right-wing, especially Neo-Nazi, Anti-Semitism is often expressed in direct assaults on Jews, including physical attacks, the New Anti-Semitism is often tied to Anti-Zionism. It occurs when opposition to the State of Israel spills over from legitimate political critique to stereotypes or prejudice against \u201cthe Jews\u201d. On the left, this is often also tied to support for Palestinian rights and agency as well as anti-capitalism. Corbyn, a lifelong campaigner against racism, has been criticised for supporting an artist who produced an anti-capitalist mural that many consider Anti-Semitic. It depicted a circle of bankers around a monopoly table held up by the oppressed working masses. But, seemingly stereotyped notions of \u201cthe Jew\u201d were evident in the caricatured bankers. Corbyn later said he regretted his supportive comments, noting that he had not previously examined the mural closely but having done so considered it \u201cdeeply disturbing and Anti-Semitic\u201d. He was also criticised for saying that \u201cour Jewish friends are no more responsible for the actions of Israel or the Netanyahu government than our Muslim friends are for those of various self-styled Islamic states or organisations\u201d at the launch of the Chakrabarti report, appearing to draw an equivalence between ISIS and Israel. Corbyn later said he regretted his choice of words. Again, Corbyn has come under fire for comments in 2013, and his later defence of how he used the term \u201cZionism\u201d. Sometimes used as a critique of Israel, the vast majority of Jews would describe themselves as Zionists, denoting minimally support for Israel\u2019s right to exist, but many Jewish Zionists are deeply critical of the policies of the State of Israel vis-\u00e0-vis the treatment of the Palestinians. By equating Zionism with anti-Palestinian actions Jews are hit in the crossfire. Combatting Prejudice While left-wing Anti-Semitism is rising, evidence suggests that it  remains more prevalent both on the right-wing and in certain parts of Islamist discourse. In the UK, a 2017 poll conducted by the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism found that, mirroring national averages, 32% of Labour Party supporters endorsed at least one Anti-Semitic trope, but 40% of supporters of the Conservative Party did so. Moreover, both Islamophobia and other racisms are more typical of the right. Indeed, prejudice often does not just come in one guise, with Anti-Semitism and Islamophobia often being linked. Nevertheless, that Anti-Semitism can arise within supposedly anti-racist groups also raises the question of the need for vigilance against not just Anti-Semitism but also other forms of prejudice such as Islamophobia. Elie Wiesel and Frantz Fanon have warned that hatred against Jews may be linked to wider hatreds, prejudice, and the possibility for enacted discrimination against other groups. Muslims and Jews have often found common ground against prejudice and this tradition needs to be reinforced."

    "content": "INSTITUTIONAL DECAY is widespread in the United States, with evidence visible within governmental domains as well as without. Within government and looking only at the Executive Branch, critical attention has been drawn to everything from the FBI to the civil service, the post office, the Veterans Administration, the Internal Revenue Service and more. Not surprisingly, COVID-19 has harmed the functioning of large organisations in the US, as in other countries, exacerbating what was already problematic. Whatever is beneath the widespread decay now affects the combat-arms wings of the US military, and perhaps the most troubling case involves the US Navy \u2500 not to exclude the 7th Fleet, the most powerful in history, floating off the coast not far from Singapore. Perfect Storm Warnings Recent weeks have featured multiple media headlines about the Navy\u2019s apparently outsized morale problems with both white supremacist extremism in its lower ranks and systemic racism at its upper echelons. But these headlines are just the latest in what is by now a long series of bad-news tidings. Major scandals, revealing massive moral turpitude among Navy brass, heads off those bad-news tidings. Not very long after the infamous September 1991 Tailhook affair, the long-running \u201cFat Leonard\u201d episode has yet to fully play out. Beginning in 2006, Leonard Glenn Francis, a Malaysian national and head of the ship support group Glenn Defence Marine Asia (GDMA), spent hundreds of thousands of dollars extending favours. He provided travel expenses, luxury items, and prostitutes to a large number of 7th Fleet officers in return for proprietary contracting information, intelligence about investigations into GDMA business dealings, and even classified information about US ship movements in Southeast and East Asia. Indictments were finally handed down in 2013, but the investigation still continues: Some 60 admirals have been implicated so far as well as a vast host of lesser officers. There have been collisions from poor seamanship. On 17 June 2017, the USS Fitzgerald, a US$1.8 billion destroyer, smashed into a giant cargo ship, the Philippine- flagged container vessel ACX Crystal, off the coast of Japan. Seven sailors drowned. About two months later, on 21 August, the USS John S. McCain turned directly in front of a 30,000-ton oil tanker in the Strait of Malacca just off Singapore. Ten more sailors assigned to the 7th Fleet died. Parochial Iron Triangle Interests Official and private investigations revealed massive deceit and irresponsible buck- passing among dozens of senior civilian as well as military officials over a period of years. Repeated efforts to call attention to readiness, maintenance, training, and skills deficits, not least by Vice Adm. Joseph Aucoin when he took command of the 7th Fleet in 2015, were ignored or suppressed by more senior officials in pursuit of acquisition funding in budget competition with the other services. At the same time, the Navy\u2019s acquisition strategy has been shaped more by parochial Iron Triangle interests, defined by a distortive nexus of congressional desiderata, defence industry priorities and post-retirement revolving-door sinecure-seeking, than by sound maritime strategy. Recent war games involving the 7th Fleet suggest a significant mismatch between what the Navy has and what it needs in maritime fights with the PLA Navy in the Indo-Pacific. The possible inability of the 7th Fleet to prevail in maritime combat contingencies, or even to keep sea-lanes of communication (SLOCs) to regional allies open in a military crisis, erodes deterrence and diminishes the balm of regional strategic reassurance that the 7th Fleet is all about. It also suggests pressure to quickly ride up the escalation ladder in a crisis to involve land-based assets \u2500 a dangerous temptation indeed among nuclear-armed competitors. This past March had witnessed the embarrassing public fracas concerning the handling of a COVID-19 outbreak on the USS Theodore Roosevelt, apparently contracted in Vietnam. The captain (Brett Crozier), the Secretary of the Navy (Thomas Modley), and the Secretary of Defence (Mark Esper) all acted badly in public, as did above them all the Commander-in-Chief. Among veteran Navy personnel the TR incident came almost as a relief, since it featured just bad manners and worse management: no scandal, no bloodshed, no treasonous compromise of classified information. But that just indicated how routinised the dire the situation has become. The Mason Episode All this and more has profoundly affected moral up and down the command structure, particularly with regard to the Navy\u2019s surface fleet (less so with submariners and naval air operations). The problems seemed to coalesce after the October 2016 attacks on the USS Mason (DDG-87) while operating in the Red Sea north of the Bab el-Mandeb, off the coast of Yemen. Houthi rebels fired Chinese-made shore-to-ship cruise missiles at the Mason on three separate occasions within a week. None of the missiles hit the ship and no one was harmed, but many of the crew were deeply shocked, and the shock reverberated to other crews, as well. A main reason is that all US Navy combat operations in recent years have involved either carrier-based aircraft flying distances to deliver their ordnance or sea-launched cruise missile attacks against land targets. The close-quarters attacks on the Mason were the first hint of actual combat that current navy crews had ever experienced, and their training \u2500 which has almost exclusively involved computer-game like simulations \u2500 bore little resemblance to the live-fire training critical for developing readiness in actual combat contingencies. Many crews throughout the surface Navy are now afraid to put to sea for lack of realistic combat training. One of them on active duty on the Mason described how certain combat systems abroad the Mason that might have come in handy for defending against a cruise missile attack were either of limited capability or altogether inoperable at the time due to deferred maintenance and training deficiencies. That a member of a combat-arms service would publicly express such sentiments in front of peers and superior officers illustrates how stoicism in the face of hardship had lately become a wasting asset in the Navy. It is hard to resist the conclusion that the surface fleet Navy is in no mental condition to actually fight effectively. Primus Inter Pares No More? On 25 February 2021, in a welcome gesture of gratitude, Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin flew out to greet the USS Nimitz off the coast of San Diego on its return from a 321-day deployment. The length of deployment on this occasion owed something to concern for protecting the crew from COVID: safer at sea than in port. But the long duration of deployments has become too common--and costly. Sailors cannot be trained up to spec when they are at sea so long. and wearing the Navy\u2019s men and machines to bones and thin brass for lack of rational prioritization \u2500 is unwise for the combat-arms service that is primus inter pares in the enduring US strategic posture of forward-deploying common security goods. Perhaps that\u2019s one reason no nomination has yet been forthcoming from the Biden administration for the next civilian Secretary of the Navy. The vetting of candidates continues, but could it be that there aren't many takers for a job that promises only headaches and heartburn?"

    "title": "German Warship in Asia: Berlin's Indo-Pacific Strategy?",
    "author(s)": "By Frederick Kliem",
    "date": "No. 128 \u2013 24 August 2021",
    "content": "SOMETIME AROUND Christmas this year, the German frigate Bayern will reach Singapore. By then, it will have been deployed for over four months, taking part in naval operations and exercises, crew training, and it will have visited several ports across the Indo-Pacific. This will be the first time in nearly two decades that a German warship traverses East and South Asian seas. Mostly for historic reasons, the German navy is comparatively small, meaning that the Bayern is among the largest surface combatants Berlin can deploy. With this, Berlin has \u2500 finally \u2500 discovered both the need and value of naval assets for strategic communication and defence diplomacy, with both an internal and an external audience in mind. Reluctant Strategic Actor Traditionally, post-war Germany has not exactly been enthusiastic about security. Atypical for a country of its size and strategic location, its governments eschew strategic thinking and planning, and they leave pro-active provisions of security to others even in its immediate neighbourhood. Berlin often contributes only marginally and never unilaterally. \u201cNever alone again\u201d is one of the great lessons of Germany\u2019s 20th century experience. This sentiment is deeply rooted in both the public and political elite. It was, therefore, quite an unusual sight for Germans to see the defence minister personally bidding farewell to the Bayern and its sailors when the ship left Wilhemshaven naval base on a de facto unilateral voyage to a far-flung region. \u201cGunboat diplomacy\u201d suspicions made their rounds again among parts of the German public. The first addressee of this deployment is, therefore, a largely anti-militaristic German public. The deployment of the Bayern communicates to its people that the military, especially the Marine (Navy) can be a legitimate instrument of foreign policy \u2500 common practice in many countries but highly controversial in post-war Germany. The decision by the government seeks to gradually habituate the public to the strategic and diplomatic use of military assets beyond calls for support by Germany\u2019s allies. But the actual voyage of the Bayern, on the other hand, is everything but unilateral. Participation in multilateral exercises and UN operations symbolise a Germany that pulls its weight in action, not only rhetoric, and the public will recognise that such deployments are in support of partnerships and multilateralism, not German gunboat diplomacy. Alliance Loyalty The current government is deeply committed to the transatlantic alliance. And, as is well-known, Washington has for many years called for greater German contribution to European and global security. Germany\u2019s 2020 Indo-Pacific strategy is partly in response to this call and marks a sea change in traditional German foreign policy. Berlin recognises Washington\u2019s strategic re-prioritisation and accepts the Indo-Pacific as America\u2019s new main theatre. Berlin also admits, albeit indirectly, that the times of turbocharged export-led economic growth while leaving the provision of security good to the United States are over. The Bayern now communicates to Washington \u2500 and Germany\u2019s partners in NATO and the region \u2500 that Berlin\u2019s commitment to the Indo-Pacific and the principles laid out in its Indo-Pacific strategy \u2500 to open sea lanes and the primacy of international law, etc. \u2500 are more than lofty words. Politically unable to raise defence spending significantly, this deployment is partly meant to demonstrate that Germany is increasingly willing to pull its weight in global security. Make No Enemies As a highly export-dependent economy, Germany does have an evident interest in regional stability in Asia and open sea lanes in general. But for much the same reason, it also has a strong interest in maintaining workable relations with Beijing, the third addressee of the Bayern\u2019s message. In terms of overall trade volume, China is Germany\u2019s largest trade partner, largest import, and second-largest export market. For the critically important manufacturing industry, China is the most vital market. That the German economy is cruising through the COVID-19 crisis comparatively well is largely a function of a thriving Chinese market. Had the Bayern\u2019s deployment been left solely to the defence ministry, its route might have been more controversial, sending a more robust message to Beijing. But the government seeks to communicate that it has no part in Washington\u2019s, the Quad\u2019s, or even British intentions to challenge any of China\u2019s territorial core interests militarily. Unlike the Indo-Pacific visions of some of China\u2019s neighbours and the US, the German strategy does not single out Beijing as the main problem. Instead, it sees a future regional security order that is inclusive of China. Consistent with this message, the Bayern has requested a friendly port visit to Shanghai. Likewise, the Bayern will neither unilaterally undertake nor partake in any freedom-of- navigation operations (FONOP), and it will take a detour so as to not traverse the Taiwan Strait. This is part fig leaf, part legal requirement. Berlin wanted to avoid the legislative process of approval any potentially robust military operation has to undergo according to German constitutional law. Hence, the Bayern is decidedly not a military but a training mission. But it is also certainly meant to be a strategic signal to Beijing, and a well-received one. Symbols Matter Germany is not over-night becoming a robust militarily actor in the Indo-Pacific, and the Bayern\u2019s deployment remains it matters, nonetheless. Berlin has for various reasons identified the region as being of strategic interests. It now needs to show face, backing-up rhetoric with both hard assets and multilateral and defence diplomacy. intentionally ambiguous. But This author spends much effort trying to convince regional stakeholders that Germany can contribute to its partners\u2019 strategic interests, which are, ultimately, also Germany\u2019s interests. Alas, thus far, there has been little concrete evidence to show for. This is only a start, and the momentum must be further utilised. But symbols matter."

    "title": "Hagia Sophia as Mosque or Museum: Religion in a Post-Secular World",
    "author(s)": "By Paul Hedges",
    "date": "No. 142 \u2013 14 July 2020",
    "content": "HAGIA SOPHIA, once Christendom\u2019s greatest church, then a mosque under the Ottomans, before becoming a museum in the 20th century, is now back as a mosque. Also known as Ayasofya, the iconic building has long been a symbol of Istanbul. On 10 July 2020, it had its museum status revoked by Turkey\u2019s highest legal authorities and was restored to its former stature as a mosque by President Recep Tayyib Erdogan, capping years of public pressure. While this significant ruling surfaced on the back of Turkey\u2019s internal political dynamics, it underlies the fundamental tension between religion and secularism. The ruling to revive the mosque\u2019s former status also underscores the persistence of religion in what scholars refer to as the post-secular world. Historical Legacy In 324 CE, the Roman emperor Constantine founded his new capital Constantinople on the site of ancient Byzantium. Constantine had made an alliance with one branch of the Christian church (today\u2019s Catholic and Orthodox denominations) to help consolidate power. While Constantinople was not at first a Christian city \u0336 it contained shrines to many deities including Constantine\u2019s patron Apollo \u0336  it later became one. The Church of Holy Wisdom (originally 360, rebuilt 537), was for a long time the largest and most splendid church in the world. Still, today, it is hard for visitors not to be overawed by the spectacular vista as they enter through its great inner doors. In 1453, the Ottoman Dynasty, after many years of siege, finally took the city, and one of the first acts of the conqueror Mehmed II was to pray in Hagia Sophia, effectively establishing it as a mosque. Today, many Muslims reinterpret this as a fulfilment of one of the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s hadith, widely accepted traditionally as an end time (apocalyptic) prophecy, concerning the fall of Constantinople to Muslim hands. Secular Turn The new secularist leader Mustapha Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, who took power following the end of the Ottoman Empire in 1922, turned Hagia Sophia into a museum, opening it in 1935. A site of contestation between Orthodox Christians, for whom Hagia Sophia was still regarded as their main church, and Muslims, it was felt that a secular identity would resolve the issue. White plaster that had covered many mosaics was removed, while the carpets for prayer were lifted to show the impressive marble floor. Many Orthodox Christians have long wanted Hagia Sophia restored as a church, while many Muslims have wanted it restored as a mosque. Current opinion polls across Turkey show over 70 per cent support for the restoration as a mosque. While guards had long sought to stop anyone praying inside (particularly performing salat, the Islamic prayer), under President Erdogan recitations of the Qur\u2019an have happened, and in 2016 a prayer was held inside. Greece, in particular, has long protested against these actions as this change will be a body blow for Orthodox Christians. Hagia Sophia is listed as a World Heritage Site, and UNESCO argued, given the site\u2019s historical importance and contestation, that Turkey should to listen to international opinion. The US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the Russia Orthodox Patriarchate have also stepped in. In response, Turkey insisted that it is entirely a matter of its own internal affairs. Subsequent pressure after the decision from the international community, and Turkish opposition parties, is now unlikely to sway matters. The Post-Secular Stretching back to the 19th century, secularisation has long been accepted as the norm. That is to say, there has been a widespread expectation that religion will gradually lose ground in the public sphere and become less relevant. However, from the late 20th century, it has become increasingly clear that religion is not disappearing. Indeed, one of the mid-20th century\u2019s great theorists of secularisation, Professor Peter Berger, stated at the close of the century: \u201cthe world is as furiously religious as ever.\u201d The Iranian Revolution of 1979 was a first indication of such a change on the global stage, again 9/11 brought religion very clearly into the public eye, while President Trump\u2019s cultivation of the religious right, electorally influential since at least Ronald Reagan\u2019s time, has shown how religious rhetoric and constituencies can be politically significant. Religion, which arguably never actually went away, is now front and centre in world politics. The noted German political theorist and philosopher, J\u00fcrgen Habermas, has been amongst those who have spoken of our current world as \u201cpost-secular.\u201d This term refers to the way that religion persists within the secular world. Or, for some, may indicate a new stage that comes after the age of secularism. While theorists debate whether secularism has ended, or indeed what is entailed by it, certainly we live in a world in which religious commitments, ideologies, and political movements are an active, increasingly visible, part of our world. Hagia Sophia and Post-Secularism Given what secularism entails, it was taken for granted that the transition from church to mosque to museum was natural. Indeed, Hagia Sophia\u2019s new secular museum status would trump any religious claims as it was seen to be both natural and non- partisan. Certainly, secularism is still seen by many as a neutral ground that allows for interreligious dialogue and coexistence. However, as we enter a realm of the post-secular, it is perhaps only natural that claims for secular sites to be replaced by religious sites will occur. For some, secularism is seen as being hostile to religion rather than neutral. As such, we will expect to see such claims. It is not simply an internal Turkish issue, but one symptomatic of a wider global trend of the reassertion of religion. The current decision on Hagia Sophia will not, though, settle contestation on this site, while the wider context in which it exists will not go away. Religious and secular demands are not a zero-sum game, but some on both sides may wish to paint it as such. Advocates of secularism meanwhile will need to think about how they frame their case for its neutral, even religious-friendly, credentials if they wish to win the ideological battle within a post-secular world of cultural wars."

    "title": "Leadership in Cyber Security: Who Takes Responsibility?",
    "author(s)": "By Kogila Balakrishnan",
    "date": "No. 138 \u2013 6 July 2020",
    "content": "COVID-19 HAS opened up new possibilities and transitioned the world rapidly into digital working. Many organisations and corporate leaders now appreciate that one can work from anywhere around the world, provided one has access to the right tools and infrastructure. Yet the digital revolution and alarming rate of usage of online platforms and digital technology for work has also opened Pandora\u2019s Box. We are now faced with increasing rates of cyber vulnerabilities and susceptibility to cybercrime. Leadership in a Vulnerable Cyber World Cyber threats are diverse and complex. Industrial supply chains, logistics companies and banking systems have been hacked to disrupt, steal and monetise commercial information. The recent London CogX 2020 festival of Artificial Intelligence and emerging technology addressed the issue of cybercrime and what we can do to create a safer and secure cyber environment. However, the question remains: who assumes leadership for tackling the cyber security challenges? The common challenges that keep emerging in the cyber world centre on the lack of a common language and a lack of collaboration among states and industries to adhere to cyber law. There is also the question of a lack of transparency and ethics in how to operate in a cyber environment. A United Nations for Cyber Security? It should be highlighted that the Budapest Convention on Cyber Security was drawn up by the Council of Europe in Strasbourg in 2004. The convention called for a harmonisation of national laws and improved investigative techniques and greater cooperation. As of 2019, 64 countries have ratified the convention. The panel at the CogX conference looked at cyber security as a global problem and called for stronger global collaboration, even suggesting a \u2018United Nations for Cyber Security\u2019. This spontaneous proposal came about as most speakers on the panel were sceptical of the existing role of the United Nations and its capacity to combat cybercrime. A few existing international groups that address cyber issues include the European Union Agency for Cyber Security (ENISA), Asia Pacific Computer Systems Response Team (APCERT), and the International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). But collaborative initiatives have also been challenging, as governments either do not want to collaborate due to mistrust, or industries are too conscious of commercial sensitivities. In 2004, the UN Group of Government Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (UN GGE) was established. Its mission is to develop a common approach on how governments should behave in cyberspace. Its 2015 report provided the foundation for an internationally-recognised governmental cyber code of conduct. The report highlights the urgent need to improve communication and consensus mechanisms between states in regard to cyber security. Finding a working solution to this will be a challenge as states seek to project sovereignty in the cyber domain. Future Trend The number of people adopting and migrating to digital platforms will surge in the coming years. This is witnessed by the number of people who were reliant on online platforms for grocery shopping, retail and food at the height of the pandemic. However, this also mean we are going to become more vulnerable to cyber crime and hacking. Hence, what should we do to increase vigilance in cyber security. There is increasing effort to address risks and weaknesses in tackling cyber crime. Usage of specific technologies such as distributed ledgers and artificial intelligence may increase transparency in the digital world. Further, there could be greater initiatives to integrate AI, Internet of Things (IOT) and 5G to enhance digital platforms. Nevertheless, the emergence of new technologies, such as cloud computing and autonomous vehicles or drones, comes with its own challenges and the question of how to create an end-to-end secure system. Further, governments need to seriously consider investing in cyber security infrastructure and tools that protect SME-scale companies from hackers. Challenges of Leadership in Cyber Security Finally, industries such as the banking sector, telecommunication, logistics and online retail traders must also do their part in securing their platforms from identity theft and monetary or business losses. We require an independent body at the international level that ratifies states adherence to any new cyber treaties. More effort should be channelled towards building cyber capacity. All levels of society - in policy, management, business, technology and technical sectors - should be exposed to cyber education and training. Underlying all of these efforts, relevant stakeholders need help to mitigate cyber risks. Overall, state or non-state actors operating in the cyber domain need to work towards a common set of agreed values. At least three possible directions may evolve: First, increased power and support for Interpol as an approach to cyber policing. This will improve the deterrence factor, by increasing the chance of malicious actors being caught. This has the advantage of posing a low political threat to states. Second, increased power to an existing or new UN body with authority over the cyber domain. It is also unlikely that this will be perceived as a threat to the cyber autonomy of states. Three, improved cooperation between the major ISP providers and legal/police authorities. If this occurs one area that will require improvement is the issue of jurisdiction and disjointed legal positions across nation states on cyber legislation. Ultimately, leadership in cyber space is a cultural and education issue, not one of political/authority leadership. Hence, this is not about a top down imposition, but a collective bottom- up agreement on norms and values. But who should take responsibility for leadership in cyber security? Perhaps, a country like Singapore that has invested heavily in cyber research and capacity development, should take the helm. In fact, Singapore features as the top-ranking country in the UN Global Security Index for commitment in cyber. Hence, at a time like this when the major powers are embroiled in turmoil, Singapore could step in to collaborate with ASEAN members and at the same time build global partnership in building a cyber- resilient eco-system."

    "title": "Indonesia's New Parties: Evolving Conservative Landscape?",
    "author(s)": "By Alexander R. Arifianto",
    "date": "No. 198 \u2013 19 November 2020",
    "content": "ON 10 NOVEMBER 2020, Rizieq Shihab \u2013 Indonesia\u2019s controversial Islamist preacher and founder of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) \u2013 returned home after three years of self-imposed exile in Saudi Arabia. He was greeted by tens of thousands of supporters, a scene reminiscent of the 2016/17 Defending Islam Action rallies in Jakarta for which he was instrumental in sponsoring and organising. Rizieq\u2019s return to Indonesia seems to be part of a concession by the Indonesian government to defuse any efforts by him, FPI, and the Defending Islam Alumni Network to undermine the Joko Widodo (\u2018Jokowi\u2019) administration. The enthusiastic greeting from his followers also signifies that support for conservative expressions of political Islamism is gaining ground in Indonesia. Surveys have shown that up to 40 percent of Indonesian Muslims can be categorised as Islamists, as indicated by their support for the enactment of Islamic principles in the Indonesian legal and political system. Prabowo\u2019s \u2018Betrayal\u2019 and Leadership Vacuum Many Islamist activists who joined the 2016/17 rallies became ardent supporters of retired General Prabowo Subianto in his unsuccessful electoral challenge against Jokowi during the 2019 presidential election. However, they felt betrayed after Prabowo decided to align himself with Jokowi and joined the president's second term cabinet; this led them to abandon Prabowo and his Gerindra Party. Prabowo\u2019s turnaround caused a vacuum in leadership for Indonesians who are religiously conservative and wish to have Islamic values reflected in the country\u2019s public and social policies. In the past few months, several new political parties and organisations with Islamist platforms were established to accommodate the need of this constituency to be represented in Indonesia\u2019s public sphere. A new group called the Action Coalition to Save Indonesia (KAMI) was established the day after Indonesia\u2019s 75th Independence celebration, on 18 August 2020. The group was formed by retired General Gatot Nurmantyo, a former Indonesian Army Chief of Staff; Din Syamsuddin, a former general chairman of Muhammadiyah, Indonesia\u2019s second largest Islamic organisation; and some 150 other retired politicians. KAMI is a \u2018rainbow\u2019 organisation \u2013 albeit with a strong Islamist presence \u2013 which aims to unite the opposition against President Jokowi. It made a major public presence in the past month as its members staged demonstrations against the newly-passed Omnibus Job Creation Law sponsored by the government. New Islamist Parties Several new political parties were formed in the past few months by politicians and groups wishing to develop stronger linkages with the conservative Islamist constituency. On 1 October 2020, Amien Rais, a former Muhammadiyah  chairman and founder of the Muhammadiyah-linked National Mandate Party (PAN), announced the formation of a new party called the Ummah Party (Partai Ummat). Unlike PAN, which was founded as a nationalist party and adopted Indonesia\u2019s national ideology of Pancasila, Partai Ummat adopts the Islamic principle of monotheism (tauhid) as its core value. This means the new party sees pious Muslims, particularly those adhering to conservative Islamist principles, as its primary constituency. It is not an inclusivist party for all Indonesians irrespective of their ideological and religious backgrounds \u2013 as how PAN was conceived when Amien Rais founded it during the early Reformasi years. Weeks later, the New Masyumi Party was established by Cholil Ridwan, head of the Indonesian Council for Islamic Propagation (Dewan Dakwah Islam Indonesia). It claimed itself as the successor to the Masyumi Party \u2013 one of Indonesia\u2019s leading Islamist parties during its first democratic period (1950 to 1959). From Politics to Religious Activism Running on a platform to implement Islamic law (shari\u2019a) as the foundation of the Indonesian state, Masyumi was one of the four largest parties in the Indonesian parliament during the 1950s. Masyumi was legally prohibited in 1959 as it was one of the few parties which opposed President Sukarno\u2019s rollback against Indonesian democracy back then. The ban was renewed by Sukarno\u2019s successor General Suharto in 1967. In response to the ban, Mohammad Natsir, Masyumi\u2019s chairman, founded Dewan Dakwah as a vehicle to continue its legacy. However, the new organisation devoted itself to religious activism, and refrained from adopting a political cast to its organisation, to escape the New Order\u2019s repressive policies. Dewan Dakwah was known during the 1980s and 1990s as one of the few Islamist organisations that was able to operate relatively freely in the restricted public space tightly controlled by the Suharto regime. It was known for its criticisms of \u2018liberal\u2019 reforms propagated by moderate Islamic thinkers like Abdurrahman Wahid and Nurcholis Madjid, and condemnations of alleged \u2018heresies\u2019 by Muslim minority groups. When the Suharto regime fell and the Reformasi-era began in the late 1990s, the influence of Dewan Dakwah declined in conjunction with the rise of new Islamist groups, like FPI, Hizb ut-Tahrir Indonesia (HTI), the Muslim Brotherhood-inspired Tarbiyah Movement \u2013 and others which are advocating for similar conservative Islamist viewpoints. Low Threat to Jokowi or Significant Voting Bloc? Dewan Dakwah\u2019s revival of the Masyumi Party is likely a move by its leader to regain the organisation\u2019s reputation as a preeminent player among the growing number of conservative Islamist groups which oppose President Jokowi. New parties or entities like New Masyumi, Partai Ummat, and KAMI are competing for the support of prospective followers who are sympathetic to their ideological agenda, particularly when the campaign for the 2024 general election kicks into gear in the next two years. However, the establishment of these groups also meant that conservative Islamists are becoming more politically fragmented. If the situation holds, this could mean that despite their growing number and bolder political stances, collectively Indonesian Islamists would remain marginalised. Hence, they constitute a minimal threat during the remaining years of Jokowi\u2019s presidency. Nonetheless, they still constitute a significant electoral voting constituency, which would certainly be sought after by any presidential aspirants during the 2024 Indonesian general election."

    "author(s)": "By Faizal Bin Yahya and Shazly Zain",
    "date": "No. 100 \u2013 20 May 2020",
    "content": "ONE CRUCIAL part of the global economy which the COVID-19 pandemic has wrecked is the aviation industry, both the production of aircraft and associated products as well as the air transportation itself. According to one estimate, more than 16,000 passenger jets are grounded worldwide. Another estimate stated that almost 90,000 pilots are unemployed. Everyone in the business is thinking about the way forward. Singapore, which is a key node in the global commercial aviation network, has not been spared from the meltdown. The impact has been keenly felt by both Singapore Airlines (SIA) and the Changi air hub. Changi Air Hub-SIA Nexus: Strategic Formula for Economic Success In 2019, the Changi air hub served 68.3 million passengers, handled more than two million metric tonnes of air freight and managed 382,000 aircraft movements, making it the 17th busiest airport in the world. In 2018, a reputable industry source ranked Changi Airport as Asia\u2019s most connected international airport and No. 8 globally. SIA operates out of Changi Airport to reach destinations around the world. SIA and the Changi air hub are inextricably linked. In his recent parliamentary statement, Singapore\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Heng Swee Keat highlighted their symbiotic relationship and importance to the country\u2019s economy. Changi Airport\u2019s growth and development is dependent on international passengers and SIA is key to this growth. In 2019, the SIA Group that includes Silk Air, Scoot and SIA Cargo accounted for more than half of Changi Airport\u2019s passenger traffic and volume. Good air hubs are supported by either a strong local airline or a very attractive city where there is a strong pull for travellers (for example, Bangkok, London or New York). This formula has been at the core of the decades-long interlocking success of SIA and the Changi air hub. The economic contribution of this strategic nexus is undeniable: according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the air transport sector in Singapore directly employs 119,000 people, indirectly supports 78,000 jobs from its suppliers, and contributes a further 26,000 jobs through spending of wages from the air hub employees. The flow of foreign tourists arriving in Singapore or transiting via Changi Airport is critical because their spending supports 152,000 additional jobs within the airport itself such as retailers. Innovating Air Travel in Post COVID-19 Era SIA\u2019s global connectivity is an integral part of Singapore\u2019s tourism strategy. The air transport industry contributed more than S$32 billion in local spending and foreign tourists supported a further $53 billion for a total of $85 billion towards Singapore\u2019s GDP. It cannot be overstated: as a city-state on a relatively small and densely populated island, Singapore faces structural limitations in drawing business visitors and tourists. For its economic and future development, Singapore simply needs to keep the successful and globally oriented SIA-Changi air hub formula going. Certainly, before the COVID-19 crisis hit, both were chugging along very nicely. SIA was consistently ranked among the top airlines in the world and it was Asia\u2019s first and the world\u2019s third airline to have been accredited by IATA with the IATA Operations Safety Audit (IOSA). In terms of national brand equity, particularly in promoting international recognition of Singapore\u2019s political stability, infrastructural excellence, multilateral cooperation, technological readiness and future-oriented development, SIA has been the iconic complement and value validation. Innovation by SIA across the spectrum of services also supports the growth of the aviation industry. SIA, one of only a handful of globally recognised brands from Singapore, has the added ability to attract all segments of international and regional passenger travel to Changi. In turn, this helps to spur innovative capacities for a range of services at the air hub. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the Changi air hub already faced intense competition because more airports were being built in the region and newer planes could fly longer economically and bypass a stopover at Changi. SIA has just announced an initiative to innovate air travel in the post COVID-19 era; to develop a new flying experience which is safe and convenient. This will also benefit the Changi air hub. SIA, Changi Air Hub and the Continuing Singapore Story It must be reiterated that national support for SIA\u2019s global operations at this juncture is particularly critical because Singapore has no domestic air travel and domestic tourism market to leverage for survival and recovery after the COVID-19 crisis. If SIA cannot recover, the knock-on effects on the air hub will be serious. As DPM Heng noted: \u201cA diminished SIA will undermine our air hub\u2019s ability to recover from the crisis.\u201d Such a scenario would also result in a cascading effect on critical sectors of the economy such as tourism, manufacturing and logistics. More profoundly, the value of Changi Airport and SIA go well beyond economics. They represent symbols of success in the Singapore Saga since independence in 1965. The air hub was to complement the natural harbour advantage managed by the Port of Singapore Authority (PSA) which former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has described as the \u201cbloodline of Singapore\u201d \u2500 essential for the country\u2019s trade with the rest of the world, and the nation\u2019s survival. In other words, aviation and maritime shipping sustain the Singapore nation, enabling our multiracial society to flourish. The capability and development of Changi air hub and SIA, and their hardware or software built up over five decades, represent a significant theme of the continuing Singapore Saga. As credible and specific success stories, they sustain national self confidence as well as a sense of purpose and destiny. As such, what happens in the coming months to SIA and Changi Airport will be followed closely by many quarters in and around Singapore. Almost all other airlines around the globe have also struggled and required huge bailout arrangements by their respective governments. While SIA and the Changi air hub similarly struggle to adapt to the severe economic impact of COVID-19, many Singaporeans cheer them on from the sidelines. Despite the considerable challenges, SIA and the Changi air hub must seize the opportunity to reposition Singapore for the new air transportation era and in the transformed environment for travel business. They have an inspiring track record to bank on. It will be a timely move onto a new chapter of resilience in the ongoing and exciting Singapore Story."

    "title": "Maritime Centre in Batam: The Training Newcomer",
    "author(s)": "By Siswanto Rusdi",
    "date": "No. 125 \u2013 19 August 2021",
    "content": "IN A recent virtual ceremony, the United States ambassador to Indonesia Sung Kim officiated the construction of a campus for Indonesia\u2019s Maritime Security Board or Bakamla (Badan Keamanan Laut) on Batam Island, just south of Singapore. With a commitment to spend US$3.5 million, it was to be furnished with classrooms, barracks, and launching pad. The project was initiated by former head of Bakamla Vice Admiral Achmad Taufiqoerrochman in 2019. The training centre was originally to be developed in Serang, Banten province in West Java. But the new Bakamla chief, Vice Admiral Aan Kurnia, relocated the campus\u2019 site to Batam. Several problems have been bothering the US government, making it hesitant about going forward with its training assistance. Against this backdrop, the training centre was exposed to criticism as a form of US intervention in Indonesia\u2019s domestic affairs. The Snags: Grey Areas To resolve this potential snag, some grey areas need serious attention by the related parties involved in the preparation of the facility \u2500 both the US government and Bakamla. Firstly, the training curricula: Since the Batam training centre for Bakamla is the first model in Indonesia\u2019s maritime law education, the issue is very important. For example, which curricula will be implemented, the US or local one? There is speculation in the Indonesian media that the US Coast Guard (USCG), as the counterpart of Bakamla, will consequently be in charge of the training and therefore the deployment USCG officers. The problem is that the USCG training materials and philosophical basis are totally different from Bakamla's. Even their tactical understandings are incompatible. USCG is a military branch of the US Armed Forces while Bakamla is purely civilian. So, will the curricula adopt Bakamla\u2019s philosophy? Most unlikely, as the agency has no such experience and foundation. Since its beginning, including when it was still a coordinating entity named Bakorkamla or Badan Koordinasi Keamanan Laut, the employees are a blend of seconded civil servants, police officers and navy men. They had no training except that prepared by their respective institutions. Indonesia\u2019s Judicial System: Bakamla\u2019s Lack of Clout Secondly, the judicial system: In the US the Coast Guard has authority as the main party that handles all cases in the maritime realm of the country. It has its own attorney to do the job. His/her tasks are relatively easy to accomplish since the state\u2019s judicial system has almost everything related to maritime law: penal code, jurisprudence. In the case of Indonesia\u2019s judicial system, it only knows the National Police as the party that has the authority to bring any legal case, including maritime-related ones, to court. Bakamla has no such power. That is why when it recently seized the Iranian and Panamian tankers, MT Horse and MT Freya respectively, the board handed them over to the harbour master office of Batam for trial. Thirdly, Indonesia has many legal provisions scattered over several different laws of which only limited numbers of attorneys and judges really understand them and have been using in their ruling. Fourthly, the instructors. Who are going to teach at the training centre? USCG officers or domestic instructors? Of course, it will be a combination of them. But Indonesia has few experts to do the teaching and therefore will definitely depend on the overseas instructors. Accordingly, as soon as the training centre is completed, there will be many foreigners coming to Batam as instructors.  This inflow will be perceived negatively by the locals and will not be good for the US-backed facility. Despite its potential to improve Indonesia\u2019s maritime law by educating new Bakamla officers, the centre faces problems arising from the current maritime legal architecture. The deficit, to a certain degree, can be perceived as a confirmation of speculation that the grant is a part of the US\u2019 move to contain China\u2019s expansionism in the South China Sea. Bakamla would be seen as having been easily persuaded to support the US in its rivalry with China for regional dominance. Bakamla: Beefing Up the Newcomer Bakamla is a newcomer to Indonesia\u2019s maritime legal landscape. Six years ago, the Board\u2019s profile among local maritime law enforcement institutions was still in the making. The Marine Police and Sea and Coast Guard unit of the Ministry of Transport had negative sentiments towards Bakamla; this is because the Board had publicly stated that the two agencies would be dismantled and absorbed into Bakamla. On the other hand, the transport ministry\u2019s unit, locally known as Kesatuan Penjagaan Laut dan Pantai (KPLP), and the Marine Police are full-fledged institutions whose legal basis and traditions are much more established. Their resentment towards Bakamla is therefore understandable. Bakamla came into force by the enactment of the law on maritime affairs in 2014. This is a generic regulation for an important agency with massive tasks and responsibility. Only one provision \u2500 chapter 58 \u2500 is dedicated to the board. It will carry out coast guard tasks like law enforcement at sea, maritime search and rescue operations. Following this, President Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo issued Presidential Regulation No. 178/2014. Legal experts, however, say that this is not enough basis for Bakamla to be effective. Instead, the government should issue a Government Regulation (PP) to raise the status of Bakamla to be a primus inter pares institution. That is to say, to be the first among equals. In essence, the snags arise from the fact that the officials of Bakamla come from various educational backgrounds \u2500 from social sciences up to engineering. No specialist training is provided for them following their recruitment. For those who are seconded to Bakamla, the training is conducted by their respective internal training units without having anything to do with the board\u2019s mission. Notwithstanding the circumstances, Bakamla\u2019s dedicated maritime law enforcement training centre in Batam is still a welcome development. At the very least, it will help streamline and integrate the institutional values, procedures and management of an important institution. In the long-run, Bakamla will help produce generations of officials who will contribute to the security of Indonesia's sprawling coastline."

    "title": "Global Health Security: COVID-19 & Its Impacts Bapakism in Jokowi\u2019s Pandemic Handling: The Cultural Dimension",
    "author(s)": "By Muhamad Arif & Sigit S. Nugroho",
    "date": "No. 133 \u2013 29 June 2020",
    "content": "IN AN interview in March 2020, Achmad Yurianto, the government spokesperson for COVID19, defended Indonesia\u2019s less than transparent handling of the pandemic. Yurianto, an army medical corps colonel and the health ministry\u2019s director general for Disease Control and Prevention, drew an analogy with family relationships when describing the administration\u2019s communication strategy. Justifying why some information had to be withheld, the government, he claimed, projected itself as a father figure for the citizens so as to prevent panic and maintain public trust. Based on this belief, Yurianto felt that citizens should trust the government's system of \u201ctruth management\u201d (manajemen kebenaran). Deliberate Withholding of Information Yurianto was not merely speaking for himself. It might reflect the approach taken by the whole government in handling the COVID-19 crisis. After the initial discovery of COVID-19 cases in the country in early March, President Joko Widodo (\u201cJokowi\u2019) admitted that the government had deliberately withheld some information. Furthermore, President Jokowi also centralised information management, forbidding provincial governments from disclosing new cases. A month later, following criticism, Jokowi finally yielded, instructing the release of more detailed information on the pandemic to the public. Apart from the lack of transparency, the government was also portrayed as inconsistent and indecisive when enacting COVID-19 mitigation measures. For example, President Jokowi himself confused the public by initially banning the Aidil Fitri exodus (Mudik Hari Raya Idul Fitri), yet he allowed people to go back to their respective hometowns (pulang kampung). In other instances, government policy seemed unsynchronised with different agencies coming up with different, often conflicting, positions. As trivial as it might sound, Yurianto\u2019s remarks offers a clue to the persistent role of Javanese culture in shaping contemporary politics under the Jokowi administration. Yet this is not a new phenomenon. Father and Family: Indonesian Leadership Style The role of culture in Indonesian politics is always evident, shaping regimes\u2019 behaviour, and influencing some of its most strategic decisions. During the three decades of the New Order, President Suharto institutionalised paternalistic values \u2013 dubbed as Bapak-ism \u2013 as an integral part of the political ideology linking family life with political life. As Saya Shiraishi, the Japanese Indonesia watcher, observed: \u201cSuharto runs the state and guides the nation as Father President (Bapak Presiden); his officials as well as citizens follow him like children; and the entire nation is imagined as a family.\u201d Suharto\u2019s authoritarian paternalism was observable in how the regime managed information. The state apparatus controlled the press through prohibitive licensing. Journalists were imprisoned for writing articles to which the government objected. People were basically allowed to know only as much as the regime wished them to know. This, the regime argued, was for the people\u2019s own good. Suharto\u2019s Bapak-ism manifested authoritarian traits when facing intra-government dissent. While maintaining, even encouraging healthy rivalry among his close aides, Suharto made sure none became powerful enough to challenge his political primacy. In 1974, after the infamous Malari riots, the security chief General Sumitro was ousted. Then in the 1980s, Suharto deprived the privileges of several retired generals involved in the group of 50 dissidents known as Petition of Fifty (Petisi 50). In 1993, Suharto discharged Minister of Defence General L.B. Murdani, a loyalist who became critical of the president in his latter years. Alternative Lens to Jokowi\u2019s COVID-19 Handling What can cultural insights inform us about the Jokowi administration\u2019s COVID-19 handling? Compared to the Suharto government, how are familyism and Bapak-ism manifested in the Jokowi administration? First, as mentioned above, Yurianto\u2019s remarks and Jokowi\u2019s actions indicated traces of paternalistic values which remain influential in shaping the government's view of its relationship with society, in particular in information management. These values arguably have their roots in President Jokowi\u2019s self-portrayal, like Suharto, as a Javanese ruler. like his predecessor, Furthermore, espoused economic developmentalism: enacting several grand economic development agendas, that included the relocation of the capital city. The driving force of the Jokowi administration in the early phase of the pandemic seemed to minimise the impact of COVID-19 in order to preserve the stability essential for his developmentalist agenda. Jokowi also In doing so, Jokowi returned to the old playbook of keeping the public in the dark for the \u201cgreater good\u201d. Personal Leadership Second, at the level of personal leadership and intra-governmental management, Jokowi\u2019s Bapak-ism seems to depart from his predecessor\u2019s authoritarian tendencies. Unlike Pak Suharto, Pak Jokowi displays the more benevolent traits of paternalistic leadership: embracing inclusivity and collective decision-making. He adopts a hands-off approach, delegating  authority to his trusted advisors and ministers, and largely restrains from taking drastic measures that could endanger Indonesian democracy. When facing internal dissent, President Jokowi prefers to employ non-confrontational approaches. Rather than ousting problematic cabinet members, thereby undermining government harmony, Jokowi compensates for ministerial ineptitude by utilising other avenues. One notable example is Jokowi\u2019s penchant to utilise the military (TNI), in assisting civilian authorities in handling the pandemic. In the final analysis, we can say with confidence that the Jokowi government\u2019s current handling of the pandemic can be explained in cultural terms. The paternalistic tendency in the form of Bapak-ism in post-Reformasi Indonesian politics is still prevalent, even arguably making a comeback. There are similarities and dissimilarities between Jokowi\u2019s and Suharto\u2019s paternalistic patterns. The old \u201cinformation management\u201d playbook endures. Yet, Jokowi\u2019s tendency to display \u201cbenevolent\u201d stances might enable him to keep accommodating criticism and compensating ineptness. All in all, these insights are valuable for understanding how Indonesia\u2019s leadership think and work, especially as the country enters the New Normal phase and restart the economy."

    "title": "Asian Multilateralism in Uncertain Times The Indo-Pacific Debate: Moving Forward Together?",
    "author(s)": "By Liu Lin",
    "date": "No. 028 \u2013 15 February 2021",
    "content": "IN THE past several years, the Australia, France, Germany, India, Japan and the United States all put forward their visions or strategies for the Indo-Pacific. The Indo- Pacific debate, as it is referred to, has been taking place amid competition among major powers, in particular between the US and China. One of the main pillars of the US Indo-Pacific Strategy is the Australia-Japan-India- US quadrilateral cooperation framework (Quad), which is reinvigorating rapidly, and become more institutionalised and substantiated. The Quad is also considering expanding to other countries, such as South Korea, New Zealand, and Vietnam, to create the so-called Quad+. This trend will have much impact on the existing regional security cooperation framework, which emphasises inclusiveness and openness. It is also a challenge to the centrality of ASEAN in regional architecture. ASEAN\u2019s Response In response, ASEAN formally joined the Indo-Pacific debate by publishing ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP) in June 2019. ASEAN reemphasised the long-held principles of, among other things, openness, inclusiveness, mutual trust, ASEAN centrality and cooperation. While the AOIP may not be enough to change the geostrategic rivalry in the Indo- Pacific region, it will at least try to influence the debate and remind the major powers that in any discussion of the future regional order, ASEAN should not be neglected. Another important purpose of the ASEAN Outlook is to maintain the group\u2019s centrality in regional cooperation framework. In this aspect, what is clear is that the AOIP is not aimed at creating new mechanisms or replacing existing ones; rather, ASEAN would prefer for AOIP to co-exist within the current ASEAN-led normative and political order. In other words, the AOIP intends to influence the proposed Indo-Pacific order through making full use of and improving the existing ASEAN-led mechanisms. ADMM, ADMM+ and the Indo-Pacific Debate It should be in this context that we evaluate the role of ASEAN Defence Ministers Meeting (ADMM) and the ADMM plus its dialogue partners (ADMM+) in the shaping of the Indo-Pacific defence and security order. ADMM and ADMM+, which are at the defence ministerial level, are the two most important regional mechanisms of the existing ASEAN-led military and defence cooperation architecture. If ASEAN wants to grasp the initiative in navigating regional defence cooperation, ADMM and ADMM+ should continue to play an active role. In fact, ADMM and ADMM+ still have much relevance in the increasingly complex security and geostrategic environment. Unlike Quad, ADMM+ has a more representative membership, which includes almost all the major countries in the Indo- Pacific region. Amidst the uncertainty of rising major power competition, this ASEAN- led mechanism, provides an important and necessary platform for the big powers to engage each other. Besides, there is currently no alternative to ASEAN\u2019s convening power in Asia. Although ASEAN\u2019s capability may be limited, however, in terms of acceptance, ASEAN is still the best choice.

    "title": "International Trade: The Demise of Multilateralism?",
    "author(s)": "By Jikon Lai",
    "date": "No. 086 \u2013 27 May 2021",
    "content": "WHATEVER THE shortcomings of the body of knowledge produced by the field of Economics, there is wide consensus among economists that removing barriers to international trade will benefit all countries in the aggregate. While it is true that not necessarily every single person in every single country will see an improvement in economic position, each country that liberalises its international trade regime could expect to improve its economic position in the aggregate. With the economic gain, the population of the country could collectively choose, if it so wished, to compensate those citizens that might have been set back by the process of liberalisation. Of course, in practice this does not necessarily happen; therein lies the heart of the challenge of the liberalisation of international trade: it is not an economic issue but rather one of political economy. How do we distribute the gains from trade to ensure universal support for liberalising trade? National Interest vs International Cooperation National policy, and by extension the \u2018national interest\u2019, on international trade is generally the outcome of the battle between winners and losers from trade measures. This imbues trade negotiations with a transactional and positional quality. Trade negotiators are incentivised to focus on not just what they can get for \u2018winners\u2019 but also how they might protect \u2018losers\u2019. Since it is not possible for every single country to get something without giving anything away, trade negotiations tend to become exactly that: a negotiation over what a country has to give away in order to get something. This institutional effect of domestic politics is sometimes compounded by the systemic effects of international politics that train policy makers to focus on relative gains (who gets what? will I get more than my rivals?). As a result, while economists emphasise the collective benefit of international trade, the policy makers and trade negotiators of most countries tend to approach international trade in a transactional and competitive manner. This tension between the shared benefits of an open, rules-based trading system and narrow national-interest is a long-standing feature of the international trade system. It is the classic face-off between international cooperation (or multilateralism) vs nationalism that has coloured virtually all facets of the trade regime and is often the underlying reason for the difficulty with making progress in international trade negotiations. Mercantilism in the WTO The history of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) since it was established in the mid-1990s is a vivid example of this dynamic. One of the key roles, if not the main role, of the WTO is to facilitate trade liberalisation, mainly through trade negotiations. However, the primary set of trade negotiations sponsored under the WTO, known as the Doha Round, was ultimately acknowledged to be dead after 14 years of discussions when it was buried under the inability to confer market access that largely pitted developed countries with less developed ones, all of whom focussed more on their respective national, rather than joint, interests. While an agreement on trade facilitation and one on government procurement were completed under the banner of the WTO, both are narrow in subject matter and the latter also narrow in terms of number signatories which reflect the challenge of securing wide international cooperation. More recently, the Appellate Body that is part of the WTO\u2019s dispute settlement system was rendered inoperative from December 2019 onwards because the United States unilaterally withheld support for the appointment of new members to the Body as it felt that the implementation of the system no longer served its national interest. The inability of members of the WTO to forge new trade outcomes on a multilateral basis, that is, in a way that includes all members of the WTO, has prompted member economies to seek unilateral, bilateral, regional and/or plurilateral solutions. The growth of regional trade agreements exploded in the period after the WTO was established. More dramatically were the trade wars initiated and unilateral trade measures adopted by President Donald Trump. These developments have cumulatively prompted many to question the fate and on-going relevance of economic multilateralism in recent years. The Search for First Best Outcomes This brings us back to our starting point. The demise of multilateralism in international trade might not be such a terrible thing except that there is near universal agreement that freer trade achieved through multilateral approaches would result in first-best outcomes. Anything else would lead to fragmented and less good outcomes. Recent measures related to COVID-vaccines offer a good example. In an ideal world, international cooperation would result in orderly supply of inputs to maximise the production of vaccines that are then distributed around the world to ensure that individuals are vaccinated according to universally agreed ranking of priority. Instead, nationalistic measures have resulted in disrupted production of vaccines, unproductive (and arguably unfair) hoarding of vaccines and the distribution of vaccines not according to need but instead wealth. These nationalistic measures might benefit a small handful of countries in the short-term, but it will leave the entire world much poorer and at continued risk of the virus. They will arguably also ultimately harm the small handful of countries that have adopted these measures. As the world slowly struggles to emerge out of the fog of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been a number of seminars, workshops and conferences on economic multilateralism in recent months that appear to reflect anxieties about the state of international economic cooperation. As the world ponders a post-pandemic economic future, it would be good if policymakers could heed the lesson of the virtue of international cooperation on trade (and more generally, economic) policies, exercise leadership at the domestic level and overcome their nationalistic urges at the international level. Let economic multilateralism, and not nationalism, live."

    "title": "Ayodhya: Rising Hindu Violent Extremism?",
    "author(s)": "By Rueben Dass",
    "date": "No. 161 \u2013 24 August 2020",
    "content": "ON 5 AUGUST 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the construction of the Ram Janmabhhoomi temple in Ayodhya, on the grounds of the 16th century Babri Mosque which Hindu militants occupied and destroyed 28 years ago. Both Muslims and Hindus have laid claim on the land where the mosque sat, upon which the new temple is now going to be constructed. The Babri Masjid was built by Moghul emperor Babur in 1528. Hindus claim that the mosque was built on land where a Hindu temple commemorating the birthplace of Lord Ram was located. In December 1992, members of the Hindu nationalist group, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), demolished the 492-year-old Babri Masjid complex in a deadly riot. Subsequent riots broke out across the country taking the lives of more than 2,000 people. Severe Hindu-Muslim communal tensions and legal battles ensued, culminating in a Supreme Court decision in 2019 granting the land to the Hindus and paving the way for the construction of the Ram Janmabhoomi temple. Anniversary of Article 370 & BJP Ideology In officiating the opening of the temple, Prime Minister Modi had chosen a date of some significance. It coincided with the first anniversary of the abrogation of Article 370 of the Indian constitution, which granted special, semi-autonomous status to the regions of Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) and special privileges to the people of the state. The revocation of the special status was seen by Kashmiris as a move to weaken the Muslim majority hold on the state by allowing Hindus to buy land and settle there. The reactions worsened when the government imposed an Internet and media lockdown in the state and a crackdown on local political leaders such as former J&K chief ministers, Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah. The choice of the dates could not have been merely coincidental. Both events symbolised what the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government sees as its success in bringing its Hindu nationalist agenda to the centre stage of mainstream Indian politics. After the groundbreaking ceremony in Ayodhya, a BJP general secretary claimed that the date marked the \u2018victory of BJP ideology\u2019. Indian journalist Bhavna Vij-Aurora stated that both these events are landmarks that \u2018signify the complete transformation of national politics\u2019. Taken together, the Ram Bhumi Phujan and the abrogation of Article 370 signalled the consolidation of a Hindutva agenda on the national stage, which has the propensity to induce increased Hindu-Muslim tensions and a further rightward shift of mainstream Indian politics. Hindu Terror against Minorities The rise of the BJP government has coincided with an increase in mob violence by members of the RSS against minorities in the form of cow vigilantism or lynching. Formed in 1925 as a response to British occupation, the RSS is a paramilitary volunteer group that is ideologically Hindu nationalist-supremacist. It has more than four million members, vast networks across the country and substantial political influence, in particular, with the ruling BJP. Cow vigilantism is an expression of religious fundamentalism as cows are viewed as sacred in the Hindu religion. The gau rakshas, or cow protection units consisting predominantly of RSS members, often target Muslim cow herders who transport and slaughter cows for a living. BJP politicians have often defended these vigilantes and denied their wrongdoings. The police and judiciary across the country have been accused of closing one eye to such Hindu violence. For example, in 2017, 55-year-old dairy farmer Pehlu Khan was assaulted and killed alongside four others by a mob in Rajasthan. It was alleged that sloppy investigation by the police led to Indian courts acquitting six accused, citing lack of evidence despite Khan naming the accused in his \u2018dying declaration\u2019. The Rajasthan home minister defended the attackers, stating that there was nothing wrong in them trying to stop cow trafficking which is illegal. Apart from cow violence, the courts have also acquitted individuals involved in Hindu terrorism. In 2019, a special court acquitted four men suspected to be members of the Hindu terror group, Abhinav Bharat, for their involvement in the 2007 bomb blast on an express train connecting Delhi to Lahore. This came after India\u2019s National Investigation Agency (NIA) found the four men to be guilty of the attacks, killing 68 people, mostly Pakistanis. Similarly in 2018, five men involved in the 2007 bombing of the Mecca Masjid in Hyderabad, which claimed nine lives, were acquitted by the court, citing lack of evidence even though initial NIA investigation found them guilty of the attacks. The men were believed to have links with Abhinav Bharat. Cycle of Violence: Rising Terror Threat India is in danger of suffering from a vicious cycle of violence and extremism as a result of BJP\u2019s controversial policies and RSS\u2019 continued use of violence against Muslims. This could lead to an alienation of the Muslim community, pushing some disenfranchised Muslims towards joining militant groups in retaliation. This has already been seen in Kashmir. Whilst the increased security presence and lockdown in J&K post-Article 370 have resulted in lower terrorism-related deaths, there has been an increase in militant recruitment among locals in the region. Groups such as Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) and ISIS have sought and will continue to exploit Hindu-Muslim communal tensions in India. Both groups have used the rise of Hindu supremacism in India as a rallying call for Muslims to join the jihad against a government seen as discriminatory against them. As part of their ideological propaganda targeting Muslims in the region, jihadi groups have highlighted persecution of Muslims in J&K, rise of Hindutva violence against Muslims and the passing of controversial legislation, such as the Citizenship Amendment Act that grants citizenship exclusively to illegal immigrants of all other religions except Islam. The rise of this uncompromising form of Hindutva threatens a deepening of the fissures within India\u2019s social fabric which can lead to further intercommunal violence, and also extremism and terrorism. The Ram temple and Article 370 point in one direction: India needs to brace itself for further ramifications of a rising potential of Hindutva violent extremism, coinciding with the ascent to power of the BJP."

    "title": "US-Philippines: Resetting the Security Alliance?",
    "author(s)": "By Julius Cesar Trajano",
    "date": "No. 035 \u2013 24 February 2021",
    "content": "DESPITE THE pro-China and anti-American rhetoric of President Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippines definitely remains a close ally of the United States and the bilateral alliance should be seen as considerably healthy. The alliance has been bolstered by shared maritime security interests in the South China Sea as well as America\u2019s robust humanitarian engagements with the Philippines\u2019 vulnerable local communities. There has been a formidable pushback from the Philippines\u2019 security and policymaking actors as well as the general public on cutting defence alliance with the US while cozying up to China. Nonetheless, Duterte\u2019s renewed threat to completely abrogate the Philippines-US Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), after he postponed its termination last year, has again raised doubts about the future of the alliance. Would it complicate the efforts of President Joe Biden\u2019s administration to reinvigorate the US alliance? Or would things improve with the end of the Duterte presidency next year? Deeply Rooted Alliance Duterte\u2019s threat to terminate the VFA came after Philippine and US secretaries held discussions on security cooperation to reaffirm that a strong US-Philippine alliance is vital to a free and open Indo-Pacific region. Both US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and State Secretary Antony Blinken renewed a previous commitment by the US to defend the Philippines against external armed attack in the South China Sea. The renewed threat comes on the 70th anniversary of the 1951 Philippine-US Mutual Defence Treaty (MDT), which has been the bedrock of bilateral military cooperation since the end of World War II. The Philippines is among the five formal US treaty allies in the Indo-Pacific. Anchored in the treaty is the VFA which allows joint military exercises between American and Filipino forces. The joint military exercises have been the most evident manifestation of the bilateral partnership. In recent years, disaster response has been added to maritime security and counter-terrorism joint training exercises. To make their alliance responsive to contemporary security challenges and opportunities, the Philippines and the US signed the 2014 Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), allowing the US to build and operate facilities in Philippine military bases for its rotational deployment of troops and equipment. Still a Vital Anchor The alliance with the Philippines is still an important anchor for the US position as a resident power in Southeast Asia. It is in the mutual interest of both the Duterte administration and the Biden administration to preserve the alliance, particularly the implementation of MDT, VFA and EDCA. Aside from counter-terrorism cooperation, they are vital for disaster relief cooperation amidst rising vulnerability of the Philippines to disasters. These arrangements are also crucial for projecting America\u2019s military presence in the South China while deterring China\u2019s use of force against Philippine troops and any hostile actions that would limit US freedom of navigation in the region. Apart from the South China Sea, crises such as the Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 and the Marawi City Siege, which happened during the Duterte presidency in 2017, actually vividly demonstrated how maintaining the alliance is beneficial for the Philippines. For the past 10 years, the US has provided not just military equipment and key intelligence information but also US$340 million worth of humanitarian and rehabilitation aid, such as the Marawi Response Project, to affected local communities. Why Manila Remains a Close US Ally There are several reasons why the Philippines remains a close ally of the US, despite Duterte\u2019s pronouncements. First, the Philippine military and the rest of the defence establishment maintain a very close partnership with the US military given the long history of joint trainings and professional exchanges between the two militaries. The defence establishment has subtly moved to even postpone the termination of the VFA. And after Duterte\u2019s latest threat, his own Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana announced that the military is largely supportive of the continuation of the VFA with the US. Second, while its military modernisation has been steadily progressing, the Philippine armed forces benefit from regular and short\u2010term training visits of US forces and capacity building assistance. Since 2015, which covers most of Duterte's six-year term, US military aid for the Philippines amounted to $765 million, making the Philippines by far the largest recipient of US military assistance in the Indo-Pacific region. Third, 60% of Filipinos see their former coloniser, the US, as the country's most trustworthy foreign partner, based on a recent survey. China, in contrast, is among the least trusted. Public opinion or sentiment matters in determining key government policies and actions in the Philippines. Fourth, beyond high-level security talks and military exercises, the alliance relationship has already deepened and broadened. This takes place through US Agency for International Development\u2019s local communities, businesses, academics, NGOs and local governments in the context of addressing climate-related security risks and disaster preparedness. (USAID) grassroots engagements with Way Forward The Philippines-US alliance is strong enough to weather any storm. Nonetheless, there are various approaches the Biden administration could pursue while waiting for the end of Duterte\u2019s term and a new administration in Manila by June 2022. First, as Philippine and US officials are about to meet to discuss the future of VFA, the US can convey that it will at least review the \u201cdifferences\u201d that Manila needs to iron out, especially the criminal jurisdiction over US troops in the Philippines. Second, any form of US assistance that can help the Philippines solve its COVID-19 vaccine procurement problem would solidify US support within the government and among the public. Public sentiment in the Philippines indicates extreme concern over China\u2019s vaccine diplomacy and high preference for other vaccines, including from the US. Third, the US can utilise the burgeoning Philippine security ties with other US treaty allies in the Indo-Pacific. South Korea and Japan have become major defence suppliers to the Philippine military and coast guard in recent years, while Australia has further deepened its security cooperation with the Philippines. These countries can help convey to Manila the importance of maintaining all treaty alliances in the region for all of them. Finally, the Biden administration can maximise the robust impact of USAID\u2019s humanitarian and grassroots engagements and put them at the forefront of US policy towards the Philippines. In this way, no amount of petty rants can trump a deeply rooted US alliance with the Philippines."

    "title": "Asian Multilateralism in Uncertain Times ADMM-Plus: Japan in ASEAN Defence Diplomacy",
    "author(s)": "By Shoji Tomotaka",
    "date": "No. 029 \u2013 16 February 2021",
    "content": "THE SUGA administration is treating ASEAN with increasing importance for Japan\u2019s maritime security, given Beijing\u2019s growing assertiveness and intensifying tensions in the East and South China Seas. This has prompted Tokyo to cooperate with regional partners, including ASEAN, through the crucial platform of the ADMM-Plus. This is, in fact, the first of two incentives for Japan to strengthen its security ties with ASEAN. The second is that Tokyo is pursuing a more \u201ccomprehensive\u201d partnership with ASEAN by jointly addressing regional security issues, in addition to long-standing economic and political cooperation. Japan wants to remain \u201crelevant\u201d to ASEAN against the backdrop of competition with other external powers, especially China. ADMM-Plus & Big Power Competition The ASEAN Defence Ministers\u2019 Meeting Plus or ADMM-Plus, is a regional defence and security platform comprising ten ASEAN countries and their eight dialogue partners including Japan. ADMM-Plus been promoting practical security cooperation since its establishment in 2010. The ADMM-Plus consists not only of a ministerial meeting, but also of various sub- group meetings including experts\u2019 working groups (EWGs). The EWGs facilitate the conduct of cooperative activities by ADMM-Plus participants in non-traditional security. Currently, there are seven EWGs on specific fields including humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR), maritime security, and peace-keeping operations (PKO). Through practical cooperation, the ADMM-Plus has benefited member countries in enhancing their capacity to effectively address non-traditional security threats. The ADMM-Plus, however, is not only a platform for cooperation; it is also an arena for competition and conflict. Major powers, including the United States and China, are competing for political influence in the region, garnering support from ASEAN in particular. This competitive aspect prevents the ADMM-Plus from developing confidence-building measures. ADMM Plus One? However, competition among external players reinforces the significance and centrality of ASEAN. Major powers such as the US, China, and Japan are keen to hold a so-called \u201cADMM Plus One\u201d meeting on a regular basis to forge bilateral ties between the countries and ASEAN. Thus, ASEAN can take advantage of its central position in influencing the major powers\u2019 regional strategies. Japan has been a strong supporter of the ADMM-Plus since its founding because it is the only official forum for defence ministers in the Indo-Pacific region to meet. It is also an effective mechanism to promote substantial security cooperation among regional countries. Japan has been proactively supporting the ADMM-Plus by its co-chairmanship of three EWGs: on military medicine with Singapore in 2011; on HADR with Laos in2014; and on PKO with Vietnam this year, in 2021\u20132023. In addition, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and Self-Defence Forces (SDF) of Japan have actively participated in meetings and joint exercises related to other EWGs. Japan\u2019s Three Strategic Objectives Tokyo has sought to achieve three strategic objectives by participating in the ADMM- Plus. First, Tokyo is attempting to contribute to institutionalising security cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. The strategic environment in the region is facing serious security challenges such as great-power rivalry, arms race, and attempts to change the status quo by coercion. In particular, territorial disputes in the South China Sea raise concerns regarding the rule of law and freedom of navigation. Therefore, the Japanese government intends to strategically promote multilateral security cooperation for building mutual trust among participating countries to address regional security issues. In other words, Tokyo hopes for a \u201cspill-over\u201d effect by transforming deepening cooperation in non-traditional security into a cooperative atmosphere to alleviate tensions in traditional security. Second, Japan sees the ADMM-Plus as a convenient venue to convey its stance on defence and security. In April 2007, the MOD issued an official document entitled \u201cBasic Policy for Defence Exchanges\u201d. The paper stipulated that defence exchanges should be conducted to promote an understanding of Japan's defence policy, as well as to convey the country\u2019s concerns about other countries\u2019 defence policies or military activities to encourage them to revise their approaches. Third, Tokyo is trying to promote security cooperation with ASEAN and to support ASEAN\u2019s centrality in a multilateral security framework, motivated by the two incentives to strengthen its security ties with ASEAN mentioned earlier. Japan\u2019s \u201cADMM Plus One\u201d: Vientiane Vision In addition to the multilateral cooperation provided by the ADMM-Plus, Japan attached great store to an \u201cADMM Plus Japan\u201d framework. Since 2014, Tokyo has held a defence ministers\u2019 informal meeting with ASEAN, almost annually. At the second ASEAN-Japan Defence Ministers\u2019 Informal Meeting in Vientiane in 2016, Defence Minister Tomomi Inada announced a \u201cVientiane Vision: Japan\u2019s Defence Cooperation Initiative with ASEAN\u201d, which outlined Japan\u2019s basic approach toward defence cooperation with ASEAN. The Vientiane Vision was the first document that clearly presented an overall picture of the areas of priority in defence cooperation between Japan and ASEAN. This vision document stipulated that, in addition to implementing bilateral defence cooperation with ASEAN countries, Japan would promote multilateral defence cooperation with the entire ASEAN, aiming to support the association\u2019s capacity building. In providing capacity-building support, Japan focuses on: (i) consolidating the regional/maritime order based on the principles of international law; (ii) promoting maritime security cooperation; and (iii) effectively addressing increasingly diverse and complex security issues. At the sixth defence minister-level meeting between ASEAN and Japan in 2019, Defence Minister Taro Kono announced an updated version of the Vientiane Vision (\u201cVientiane Vision 2.0\u201d), which emphasised Tokyo\u2019s willingness to promote \u201cheart-to- heart\u201d, \u201ctailored and long-lasting\u201d, and \u201cequal and open\u201d security cooperation with ASEAN. Japanese Defence Diplomacy under PM Suga The new Suga administration which took power in September 2020 clearly continues to pursue his predecessor Shinzo Abe\u2019s vision of a \u201cFree and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP)\u201d, as demonstrated in Yoshihide Suga\u2019s speech during his first overseas trip as prime minister to Vietnam and Indonesia in October. In his vision on the Indo-Pacific, Suga prioritised cooperation with ASEAN by synergising Japan\u2019s FOIP with ASEAN\u2019s outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP). He also mentioned the importance of supporting ASEAN centrality not only for reinforcing ties with ASEAN but also for stabilising the strategic environment in the Indo-Pacific amidst the intensifying US-China strategic competition. In this regard, under Suga, Japan certainly continues to participate actively in ASEAN\u2019s security architecture including the ADMM-Plus. In fact, at the 10th ADMM- Plus held virtually in December 2020, Defence Minister Nobuo Kishi expressed Japan\u2019s full support for AOIP, which shares fundamental principles with Japan\u2019s FOIP. Under the new government, the updated Vientiane Vision is closely associated with FOIP. In sum, Japan under the Suga administration continues to reinforce its security cooperation with ASEAN. Nevertheless, challenges still lie ahead for Japan. These include effective policy coordination with the new Biden administration and managing relations with China."

    "title": "Global Health Security: COVID-19 & Its Impacts ASEAN & the Post-Pandemic Economy: Role of Global Value Chains",
    "author(s)": "By Dipinder Singh Randhawa",
    "date": "No. 111 \u2013 5 June 2020",
    "content": "SINCE THE mid-1990s the manufacture of goods has been increasingly reorganised along production chains that may span several countries. Such global or regional value chains (GVCs or RVCs) are facilitated by deregulation; falling barriers to trade and foreign direct investment; improvements in telecommunications and information flows; efficient logistics; and steadily improving and cheaper transportation infrastructure. These attributes have enabled ASEAN to be at the forefront of manufacturing GVCs. Managed by large multinational corporations, GVCs bring cutting edge management skills, upgraded technology and services needed to manage complex production lines. The objective is to produce the best quality goods at the lowest cost, by sourcing components from locations where they are produced most efficiently. In particular, GVCs develop in the automobile, electronics and even garments sectors because different parts of their production can be carried out in different locations at very competitive pricing levels. ASEAN\u2019s Participation in GVCs ASEAN states have consolidated their industrial growth and deepened their participation in GVCs. Factors that favoured ASEAN are its regional free trade agreements leading to lower trade barriers; an export and investment friendly ecosystem; prudent monetary and fiscal policies; steadily improving logistics infrastructure and regional connectivity; as well as close relations with China and the United States, the world\u2019s two largest economies. In the process, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and more Indonesia and Vietnam developed sizeable manufacturing bases. recently The benefits of participating in GVCs are manifold: expediting the transition from agriculture to manufacturing and services; stimulating industrial development; boosting employment, incomes and growth; and catalysing growth in productive capacity and skills development. All this helps ASEAN states move up the value chain. Global Instability and ASEAN Advantage The Global Financial Crisis of 2008-09 was a significant setback to manufacturing and trade. The path to recovery was halted by the trade dispute between the US and China triggered by President Donald Trump\u2019s imposition of tariffs in January 2018. The COVID-19 pandemic comes on the back of an already unsettled environment for GVCs since the onset of the trade dispute. The impact of the trade dispute has been particularly severe and disruptive for value chains, including those with operations in the ASEAN states. As tariffs on goods produced in China raised prices of Chinese exports to the US, rendering many of them uncompetitive, companies are increasingly relocating production to countries relatively unaffected by tariffs. For the multinational corporations, relocating out of China is not an easy decision. It entails sacrificing substantial sunk costs, the deadweight loss of installed capacity and a breakdown of relations with local suppliers. Contrary to what President Trump may have hoped for, firms affected by the tariffs are not relocating from China back to the US, but shifting base to neighbouring economies in Southeast Asia and beyond. Few firms moved production to the US. The evidence thus far shows that ASEAN economies have benefited from investments shifting out of China. Vietnam has succeeded in attracting the most diverse and arguably, the most significant volume of investment, as have Malaysia and Thailand. Post-COVID-19: Shorter Supply Chains The COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tension between China and the US will only make the regional environment ever more fraught. Expectations of a potentially volatile international trade and investment environment in the post COVID-19 era will compound uncertainties and risks to global trade and investment. Complicating matters will be uncertainties on the demand as well as supply side, stemming from a fall in incomes and demand, and poor prospects about the future. The world after COVID-19 is likely to see shorter supply chains, with resilience and reliability taking precedence over profitability. The manufacturing paradigm will transform from just-in-time to one with emphasis on securing reliable inventories of inputs. This will lead to a concentraton of manufacturing in proximate locations. Opportunities for ASEAN In the midst of the endemic uncertainty, clear opportunities lie ahead. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, ASEAN continues to draw increased investment from Northeast Asia and the West. In the first quarter of 2020, ASEAN surpassed the European Union to become China\u2019s largest trading partner, though this was largely due to lockdowns over much of continental Europe. At a time when countries are increasingly turning inwards, ASEAN remains open as an attractive investment destination. While the immediate post COVID-19 period will be one of painful adjustment, the energies of policymakers, going forward, should focus on building resilience in the face of ongoing uncertainties. To attract investment, ASEAN should accelerate the agenda towards the vision of the ASEAN Economic Community 2025 and update policies in the face of the new risk perspectives of investors. The arena of public health, with its various deficiencies and opportunities, will be a major concern for investors. Since intra-ASEAN travel is integral to business and tourism, there is a pressing need to develop information sharing and infection control protocols for individual member states and ASEAN as a whole. ASEAN\u2019s Immediate Tasks In a world of rapidly shifting comparative advantage, ASEAN will do well to develop coherent region-wide policies to upgrade skills, and coordinate policies to attract investment, enhance competitiveness and build resilience. ASEAN should develop protocols and mechanisms for managing reserves of essential inputs, and sharing crucial resources in the event of contingencies. It is time for ASEAN to dovetail trade facilitation measures with the ASEAN Digital project such that this can cut trade costs and boost competitiveness. To this end, ASEAN should enhance digital penetration and tackle the digital divide within the less advanced ASEAN economies which is crucial for intra-regional connectivity. Going forward, four issues post COVID-19 warrant ASEAN\u2019s urgent consideration: \u2022 Forge closer coordination between government and business on digital development, especially on policies regarding skills development and the facilitation of cross-border trade and investment; \u2022 Improve coordination of efforts to assist collaboration among SMEs within ASEAN to boost their engagement with GVCs; \u2022 Continue to develop an agenda for defining national industrial policies and upgrading value chains and manufacturing; \u2022 Strengthen public private partnerships for developing platforms for knowledge sharing in manufacturing and supporting sectors. ASEAN has a welcoming ecosystem for investments. It also enjoys advantages in many sectors, including electronics, automobile, food processing. These strengths can be leveraged for deployment in other industries. Going forward, ASEAN\u2019s multiple free trade agreements, including the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) contains substantial frameworks favourable to the growth of RVCs and GVCs. These should be fully leveraged."

    "title": "End of Pacific Regionalism?",
    "author(s)": "By Anne-Marie Schleich",
    "date": "No. 037 \u2013 1 March 2021",
    "content": "2021 WAS supposed to be the year of celebration in the Pacific as the 18-member Pacific Island Forum (PIF) was founded 50 years ago in 1971, four years after ASEAN. Apart from Australia and New Zealand, most of the other Pacific island members share similar challenges such as small populations, vulnerable economies and ecosystems, scarce resources, vulnerability to rising sea levels, lengthening droughts and increased cyclone intensity. For half a century, the PIF provided a regional forum for dialogue and cooperation on politics, environment, culture, economics and trade. After decades of focusing on more regional integration of its diverse member countries, it had become a strong voice and advocate for climate change issues at the United Nations. After five decades of successful cooperation, two shocking events, though, created frictions and have shaken two regional institutions in the Pacific to their bones. Shock 1: PIF Power Struggle The first event was the election of the new PIF secretary-general. For decades, there was an unwritten \u2018gentleman\u2019s agreement\u2019 that the post would rotate among representatives of the three regional subgroups Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia. After a successful six-year term of Melanesia\u2019s Dame Meg Taylor, it was the turn of Micronesia. However, Henry Puna, the previous prime minister of the Cook Islands (Polynesia), won with a slim majority of 9:8 votes against Micronesia\u2019s nominee Gerald Zackios. It was speculated that the major powers in the PIF, Australia, New Zealand and Fiji, had voted for Puna in a secret ballot. The five Micronesian countries asserted that longstanding trust among the member countries had been seriously damaged. Following a virtual Micronesian Presidents\u2019 Summit on February 8, all five Micronesian countries (Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federal States of Micronesia, Palau and Nauru) announced their withdrawal from the PIF. They expressed \u201ctheir great disappointment with the Pacific Islands Forum secretary- general appointment process\u201d and initiated the year-long withdrawal transition. The PIF has thus lost one-third of its Pacific Island members and has been thrown into massive turmoil. Shock 2: Fight Over Academic Mismanagement The second shock to Pacific regionalism happened to the University of the South Pacific (USP). With its main campus in Fiji, USP is a highly successful university, co- owned by the governments of 12 Pacific island countries, with strong funding from Australia and New Zealand. USP Vice Chancellor and whistle-blower Professor Ahluwalia was detained and deported on 4 February 2021 on the orders of Fij\u2019s PM Banaimarama. After his appointment in 2019, Ahluwalia had exposed mismanagement under his predecessor, a Fijian, who was close to the Fijian government. After an inquiry over his own alleged malpractices by a commission headed by a Fijian diplomat, Ahluwalia was suspended from his position. The ousting of Ahluwalia happened without Fiji consulting other USP partner governments. Fiji Opposition parties and civil organisations condemned the move to deport the vice chancellor. The Australian and New Zealand governments have not commented on the developments. Samoan PM Tuila'epa criticised Fiji and made a bid for Samoa as the new home for the USP. Geopolitical Backdrop: China, Taiwan & Australia These regional frictions may have wider geopolitical ramifications. The battle for influence in the Pacific Island region is intensifying. The Taiwan-China conflict is virulent in this region. The 2019 move of Kiribati and the Solomon Islands to switch their political allegiance from Taiwan to China is one aspect of this geopolitical competition. 2020 also saw a competing mask diplomacy between China and Taiwan in the region. The present Australia-China conflict has reached a deep freeze point in 2020. At the same time, China is increasing its aid footprint in the South Pacific, seeks to have a diplomatic and strategic foothold and has invested in much needed infrastructure projects. The Pacific is an important part of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). China has also surpassed Australia as a trading partner in some of the Island countries. Recent policy recalibrations and greater engagement by Australia\u2019s \u2018Pacific Step Up\u2019 and New Zealand\u2019s \u2018Pacific Reset\u2019 were meant as an answer to China\u2019s challenge and emphasised more engagement and partnership with the Pacific. Both Australia and China have in 2020 used COVID-19 aid as a diplomatic tool in the Pacific. Still, Australia seems to be in danger of losing its traditional political influence there. Also, Australia\u2019s ambivalent attitude regarding climate change issues has been viewed critically by the island countries, which are seriously threatened by climate change. COVID-19 & Climate Change The US has a strategically important military base in Micronesia\u2019s Marshall Islands and a Compact of Free Association (and with Palau and the Federated States of Micronesia) but it has much less aid and trade connections with the rest of the Pacific island countries. It recently deployed COVID-19 vaccines to Palau and the Marshall Islands. National and subregional egoism dominated Pacific matters in recent months and exposed the faultlines in the regional architecture. Greater cooperation among the member states is direly needed in times of pandemic and climate change. It is important for the region to secure sufficient COVID-19 vaccines for its populations. Equally urgent is a united PIF front in a year, when the next and very important UN Climate Conference is convened in Glasgow in November. The plight of atoll island countries in Micronesia, most affected by climate change, will be at the centre of some of the discussions there. The year-long process of exiting PIF could help provide possible compromise solutions and conflict resolution mechanisms where member countries and its subregions would save face and come together again. On the sidelines of these discussions a solution for the USP saga may also be found."

    "title": "Putin and the Navalny Factor",
    "author(s)": "By Christopher Cheang",
    "date": "No. 021 \u2013 5 February 2021",
    "content": "THAT PUTIN\u2019S government is under the cosh today is not in doubt, due to the socio- economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, weak economic growth as a result of domestic structural challenges, and various sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union. On the other hand, the strong Putin edifice is not easily shaken notwithstanding the fallout from the Alexei Navalny case. No mass support for Navalny Navalny's expose of high-level corruption is nothing new; in the latest case, a two-hour long video, which this author watched, of a huge and luxurious palace, allegedly built for Putin, was quite effective in triggering mass demonstrations. Corruption has always been and remains a sore point for the Russian people. The latest polls conducted by the Russian Public Opinion Research Centre in late January 2021 show that the president's popularity has fallen to 53% (it had been over 60% in late 2020). These polls were the first measure of the political temperature in the wake of the protests. However, while Navalny might be popular in the West, in Russia, polls taken in September and December 2020 show that \u201cthose who disapproved of Navalny (50%) were far more numerous than those who approved of him (20%),\u201d according to Russian observer, Andrei Kolesnikov, in his Carnegie Moscow Centre dated 26 January 2021. He added that many of those polled believed Navalny \u201cto be a tool used by Western security services, and this is the version that Putin himself has publicly endorsed and . . . being actively promoted by state media\u201d. Observers have also noted that the protestors were not led by a united and consolidated front \u2013 the rallying and unifying force was the demonstrators\u2019 dissatisfaction with the authorities, no doubt fuelled by the current difficult socio- economic situation. In other words, Navalny was and is not their natural leader. Carrot-and-Stick Approach To weaken current anti-government sentiments, including those recently generated by Navalny and his supporters, one might expect the government to accelerate the implementation of some of the massive US$400 billion National Projects. It might also use resources from the National Welfare Fund (NWF) for stimulus spending, in the coming months and years, especially in the run-up to the September 2021 Duma (parliamentary) elections. (The NWF, Russia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, held almost US$180 billion as of November 2020). Apart from the carrot of more public spending to benefit the population, President Putin has a powerful instrument of coercion at his disposal in the National Guard (NG), led by Viktor Zolotov, whom he has personally known and worked with, since the 1990s. The NG reports directly to the president and among other functions, is meant to protect public order. It is said to number about 400,000. The goal of Navalny\u2019s supporters in their protests on 31 January and 2 February was to pressure the authorities not to convert his suspended sentence into imprisonment. That was in vain since the government could not afford to be seen to be yielding to pressure either from the West or its own people to release the oppositionist. Navalny was jailed for two years and eight months on 2 February. The Russian authorities had issued widespread warnings to members of the public not to take part in any unsanctioned demonstrations and had closed locations for demonstrations in Moscow and other cities. A few thousand protestors were arrested during the demonstrations. If the protests see growing numbers and continue unabated in the next few weeks, the NG might be deployed in force not only to restore order but also to send a signal to the demonstrators and members of the public at large, the depth of the authorities\u2019 commitment to maintaining stability. Factors Guiding Putin's Approach Given the socio-economic and political trauma of the 1990s, it is not an exaggeration to argue that the Russian people will not want a return to that era. The majority of Russians, very conservative in nature, craved and still crave stability. Putin has cleverly exploited these sentiments and not only promised but brought the country a measure of stability and prosperity. Putin and his government will therefore find success in continuing to portray Navalny as a danger to the country\u2019s stability and prosperity and as a tool of the West. The West\u2019s support of him and calls on Russia to release him from confinement only strengthen Putin's hand, in this regard. There are several factors that guide Putin\u2019s current and future approach with respect to Western criticism over Navalny\u2019s imprisonment. First, the current tense state of relations with the West is not due solely to Navalny, as there are other already well-known factors. Hence, Putin does not have enough incentive to act on the West\u2019s calls for Navalny's release, let alone refrain from politically neutralising him. Second, the West\u2019s criticisms are considered as hypocrisy and arrogance, when seen against the current spate of mass demonstrations in the EU against pandemic restrictions and other issues (like in France, where protests have taken place against a French security law or in Poland, against a ban on abortions), and open political divisions in the US. Putin\u2019s Future in Doubt? Third, linkage no longer totally governs Russo-US/West relations; this fact is clear from President Joe Biden\u2019s first phone conversation with President Putin on 26 January 2021, during which they agreed to extend the New START arms control treaty for another five years. (It was due to expire on 5 February). This testifies to the fact that US/Western geopolitical and national security considerations will always take precedence over other factors like political or human rights. However, in response to the Navalny factor, there are now growing calls in Western Europe to halt the significant Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project from Russia to Germany. The US and some Eastern and Central European countries have opposed it from the beginning. It remains to be seen what Germany will do going forward. Domestically, the mass response to Navalny\u2019s call illustrates the fact that the state cannot match the power of social media wielded by him and his followers. According to Kolesnikov, \u201cabout 4.5 million people watched the live transmission of the 23 January protests on Navalny\u2019s online channel. Nearly 11 million watched Dozhd\u2019s (Russian independent television channel) transmission via YouTube, while TikTok videos featuring Navalny-related hashtags garnered more than 1 billion views\u201d. Finally, Navalny\u2019s dedicated supporters are said to be younger, higher-educated and reasonably well-off individuals. Should the socio-economic situation deteriorate, their numbers could increase over time. If Navalny\u2019s supporters are able to unify the currently disunited and disaffected anti- establishment elements into a coherent whole, and if the loyal opposition parties in the Duma cannot attract these elements, Putin\u2019s political position and future would then be in some doubt. The outcome of the September 2021 Duma elections will provide a clearer picture."

    "author(s)": "By Pradumna B Rana",
    "date": "No. 047 \u2013 24 March 2020",
    "content": "THE COVID-19 pandemic is not only a public health emergency but it has also resulted in a very serious economic crisis. In the past two months, the world economy has turned upside down. Stock markets have tumbled over a cliff. In the United States, the Dow Jones Index has erased the \u201cTrump Bump\u201d ending below its level when the president took office. Most countries will surely experience an economic recession with high levels of unemployment this year. Some even talk of a Great Depression similar to the one of the 1930s. Bold Policy Actions, but\u2026 Extraordinary times require extraordinary policy actions. After a late start in some countries, monetary policies have maxed out. Interest rates have been cut and are close to zero or negative in the major industrial countries such as the US, the Eurozone, and Japan. Targeted fiscal measures have also been utilised on a massive scale to help companies with fixed costs such as rent and wages and also to protect workers by subsidizing wage costs to avoid lay-offs. Radical ideas such as direct payment to households, the so-called \u201chelicopter money\u201d, and requirements for banks to slow delayed repayment of loans and mortgages are also being discussed. The relief packages being considered are already larger than those during the global financial crisis, and will increase further as the virus spreads. On the public health front, in the past two months, most of the world has virtually shut down because of school closures, lockdowns, travel restrictions, and social distancing. Many glorious cities in Europe and the US have become ghost-towns. Policy actions by individual countries have been bold but they have not been well- coordinated across countries especially in the design of fiscal packages and travel restrictions. In vaccine development, some countries have adopted go-it-alone policies rather than coordinated ones. Some countries are also imposing restrictions on exports of face masks, gloves, and other protective clothing needed by medical teams. Trump\u2019s unilateral policy of closing the US border to European Union (EU) citizens, led to surprise and disappointment on the other side. Disjointed policies duplicate efforts and are inefficient. G7 or G20? Containment of a pandemic is a global public good and needs coordinated global responses with common narratives on the challenges to be tackled. Global cooperation also makes difficult policy actions at home easier when done through coordination rather than as a knee-jerk domestic effort. On 16 March 2020, President Trump, who in the past had voiced skepticism about the G7, organised an hour-long G7 video Summit at the request of President Macron and Chancellor Merkel. But aside from a general statement of solidarity and a loose commitment to \u201cdoing whatever is necessary to ensure a strong global response\u201d to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Whitehouse (https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/g7-leaders-statement/) does not contain any major global response and action plan to be adopted. Statement Leaders\u2019 issued the by Instead it should be the G20, which was established in 2008 as forum for international economic cooperation, that should be coordinating global responses and coming up with action plans to address the pandemic, and not the G7. This is for several reasons: Why It Should be G20 First, the G20 has greater legitimacy than the G7. In addition to 19 industrial countries plus the EU represented by the EU President, the G20 includes systemically important emerging markets like Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, and South Korea that are increasingly becoming key players in the global economy. Its membership collectively accounts for 85 per cent of world GDP and 75 per cent of its population. The corresponding figures are 40 per cent and 10 per cent for the G7. Second, the G20 successfully managed the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 through coordinated monetary and fiscal stimuli designed at its 2009 Pittsburgh Summit. Instead of the expected Great Depression, we had a Great Recession. The crisis had paralysed the financial sector which had led to a collapse in global demand. The IMF, therefore, played an important role in facilitating the Leaders\u2019 deliberations. This time around, countries have to, in addition, deal with an unprecedented public health crisis. Hence, both the IMF and WHO should play key roles at the Summit. The membership of seven international institutions, including the IMF and WHO, is another advantage of the G20 over G7. Fourth, two G20 members, China and South Korea, have shown encouraging signs of recovery from the Covid-19 crisis although there are still concerns of a second round of the crisis occurring through imported cases. Their experience would surely be useful not only to the members of EU, the present epicentre of the Covid-19 crisis, and the US where infections are expected to surge further. It will be so to other heavily-populated G20 members as well such as India and other South Asian countries, and Indonesia where the pandemic is starting to raise its ugly head. Now is not the time for war of words but for cooperation and learning lessons. Needed: Emergency G20 Virtual Summit Controlling a pandemic which knows no borders and addressing its dramatic economic impact requires globally-coordinated responses. As was the case during the global financial crisis, the best and the most legitimate way of coming up with global responses and action plans is through the G20 Summit. Saudi Arabia, the present Chair, should, therefore, without delay convene a G20 virtual Summit. The agenda for the Summit should include, among others, public health measures and targeted fiscal stimulus. Waiting until November when the Summit is scheduled, will be too late."

    "title": "Future Warfare: The Two-Dimensional Security Challenge",
    "author(s)": "By Steven Metz",
    "date": "No. 022 \u2013 5 February 2020",
    "content": "IT IS impossible to predict the evolutionary path of armed conflict, in part because human decisions can send history spinning in unexpected directions. Imagine, for instance, what today's global security system might look like had not a small group of Al Qaeda leaders distracted the United States from the high tech \"revolution in military affairs\" that it was pursuing before the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The future of armed conflict will, like its past, be determined by the interplay of broad trends and human choices. But despite the difficulty of precise prediction two things do seem clear: Asia will form the vortex of the global security system; and armed conflict will have both conventional and hybrid dimensions. The Two Dimensions of Armed Conflict The conventional dimension of armed conflict will be shaped by the growing assertiveness and expanding military power of China. There may be conventional war between other nations but any conflict involving China will, by definition, be strategically significant. Technology will be central in the conventional dimension of armed conflict, especially artificial intelligence and robotics. The speed and complexity of military engagements will exceed the decision-making capability of humans, thus warfighters will increasingly rely on artificial intelligence. This will generate both technological challenges -the adversary with the most effective artificial intelligence system will have an advantage - and ethical ones. Algorithms and data sets will become centres of gravity to be attacked and defended; strategic and operational concepts will need to account for this. Because much of the technology required the interconnected global private sector, technology will disperse rapidly. for conventional warfighting will be adapted from No nation will be able to assume that it will have or can preserve aggregate technological superiority. Advantages will be situational and transitory. promoted is that of a low tax (even tax haven), unregulated, small government laissez faire paradise. Weaponisation of Everything In open political systems there may be public opposition to things like soldier enhancement technology (to include human-technology cyborgs) and killer robots. Authoritarian regimes will be able to quell or ignore any public opposition to these sorts of technologies. This could give them a leg up during conflicts with nations where the public does have a say. While large scale conventional war will be the most dangerous, conflicts in the hybrid dimension will be the most common. Polyglot, often shifting coalitions of states, proto- state organisations, transnational organised crime, and mercenaries will use armed action to advance their interests, deter adversaries, and attain psychological effects. This will be war deep in the shadows: nations which become involved may do so clandestinely to avoid the political pressure or sanction that overt involvement might bring, relying on proxies instead of direct involvement. Hybrid conflicts will often involve foreign fighters, sometimes significant numbers of them, and will have transnational, even global implications. People far from the actual fighting will play a role by narrative shaping, attention swarming, and the provision of information and other resources. Hybrid conflict will be characterised by the \"weaponisation of everything\" rather than reliance on weapon systems developed explicitly for warfighting. Think of the use of airliners for the September 11 attacks on the United States, the use of recreational drones for military surveillance, social media attacks on foreign political systems, and cyberattacks on infrastructure. In the broad sense the ongoing conflicts in Syria and Ukraine are emblematic of what the hybrid dimension may look like. Both have dragged on for years with no end in sight, and both have cascading destabilising effects both in their region and globally. Both are characterised by intricate complexity centered on psychological effects. What This Means Nations cannot ignore either dimension of the security environment. If they focus exclusively on one, their adversaries will exploit the other. But the capabilities and skills needed are different in the two dimensions. In the conventional dimension speed and the ability to function in the face of intricate complexity will determine success. Speed will mean both speed of action and speed of decision in an avalanche of information, much of it deliberately false or misleading. The most successful militaries will be those which at least exploit - and if possible master - the convergence of humans and technology. Avoiding or minimising deception will be crucial, requiring a blend of technology and human judgment. Military operations will involve swarming and dispersing across domains rather than traditional phasing. In the hybrid dimension adaptability and the ability to create tightly integrated, holistic security organisations and concepts will be the keys to success. Adaptability will be in play not only at the operational level, but strategically and organizationally - nations must be able to design and refine new security organisations as challenges evolve. Security Leaders as Cutting Edge Entrepreneurs? Security leaders and strategists must, in other words, be cutting edge entrepreneurs akin to those in the most dynamic realms of the private sector. And because psychological effects matter more than kinetic ones in the hybrid dimensions, dynamic narrative shaping will be decisive. Strategists must be psychologically astute, effective communicators rather than simply the manager of battles. Today every nation must build methods to develop the skill sets needed for the two dimensions of conflict, not only in their militaries and other government agencies, but across their societies and within the community of their security partners. They need communities of practice and simulation based on the needed skills, refine psychological and educational tools to identify and develop the skills, and organise their security organisations to recruit, retain, award, and empower people with the skills needed in both dimensions of conflict. No nation can know in advance which dimension will be most important to it at any given time, but all will need effectiveness in both. As the nature of security and conflict change, so too must the organisations and concepts to address them."

    "title": "Global Health Security War on COVID-19: More Than One Front",
    "author(s)": "By Kumar Ramakrishna",
    "date": "No. 071 \u2013 15 April 2020",
    "content": "AS SINGAPORE continues its fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, much has been written about what should or should not be done to keep the nation safe. Granted, the COVID-19 fight is at its core very much a public health issue, and one should take care not to hastily \u201csecuritise\u201d the matter. Nevertheless, given the rapidly unfolding and significant social, economic and geopolitical impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, it has arguably become a wider national security matter as well, requiring a coordinated response from other sectors. In this respect, what would a wider, more encompassing, national security response to COVID-19 entail? Adapting Clausewitz\u2019s Enduring \u201cTrinity\u201d The 19th century Prussian philosopher of war Carl von Clausewitz conceptualised war as comprising a \u201cremarkable trinity\u201d of \u201cprimordial violence, hatred, and enmity, which are to be regarded as a blind natural force\u201d; \u201cthe play of chance and probability within which the creative spirit is free to roam\u201d; and the \u201celement of subordination, as an instrument of policy\u201d. Clausewitz\u2019s interpreters have essentially identified the population as the repository of the \u201cprimordial\u201d passions and \u201cblind natural force\u201d that energises the nation for conflict; the armed forces as the site where \u201cthe creative spirit\u201d must neutralise threats characterised by \u201cchance and probability\u201d; and the government as key to harnessing such energies and responses toward clearly defined policy objectives. If we accept that the current struggle against COVID-19 is indeed a \u201cwar\u201d \u2013 as many commentators have so described \u2013 what would a systematic, coordinated \u201ctrinitarian\u201d response encompass? The Public Health Sector The public health community \u2013 the frontline medical staff in hospitals and clinics, as well as the supporting ecosystem of scientists and researchers \u2013 are the nation\u2019s \u201carmed forces\u201d against the virus. It is they who have to find ways to unleash their collective creative energies to stem the relentless, unpredictable spread of this unseen enemy. While the frontliners fight to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d of infections, the supporting medical research community have to race against time to better understand myriad issues. These range from how even asymptomatic individuals can apparently shed the virus; modelling the projected spread of the virus in the community; and what current treatments against other coronaviruses can be hastily jury-rigged and thrown into the fray. Another critical issue they have to grapple with is how far we are from effective vaccines to cope with ever-mutating strains of the bug. The public health community literally stands between the virus and the rest of the nation. They must not fail and they deserve the fullest support from other sectors. The Public The population is a key sector in this regard. No matter what accomplishments the public health sector can pull off, all will be undone if the public takes the newly-imposed \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d measures for enhanced safe distancing overly lightly. In the 1960s, soon after Separation from Malaysia, founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew declared that for Singapore to survive, we have to function as a \u201ctightly organised society\u201d. He later likened Singapore to a finely calibrated \u201cchronometer\u201d in which the government, businesses and the public pulled together effectively in the same direction. That generation helped lay the foundations for Singapore to take off and achieve First World status in a few decades. Today, many from that cohort have passed on, or are today the very elderly that are being constantly cautioned to stay home as any infection is likely to be especially harmful for them. Can the current generation rise to the occasion and emulate the social discipline and \u201cprimordial passions\u201d of that post-Separation cohort of \u201ccan-do\u201d Singaporeans? We simply must. If the circuit breaker measures, the exhortations to wear masks in public and to practise good hygiene habits take deeper root, this would be a huge step toward winning the COVID-19 war in Singapore \u2013 sooner rather than later. The Government Finally, the government \u2013 the third element of the Clausewitizian trinity \u2013 obviously must continue leading the fight at the whole-of-society level. As Singaporeans have recognised, the COVID-19 war has more than one front. Economically, the government has had to draw on past reserves to fund massive budgets to stabilise a rapidly-contracting economy to save jobs and businesses, while at the same time finding various means to maintain the resilience of food and other critical supply chains. Moreover, security and intelligence agencies have to keep abreast of the continually evolving transnational terrorist threat, given that the both violent Islamist and White Supremacist networks have urged their followers worldwide to take advantage of the COVID-19 situation to strike hard at distracted states and societies. In addition, the government must continue navigating an even more troubled regional and global security landscape, in the light of heightened US-China tensions fuelled not just by trade issues but now by accusations and counter-accusations over each side\u2019s handling of the COVID-19 situation as well. Moreover, there are indications that certain major powers have also capitalised on the global pandemic to sow disinformation and foment chaos along ethno-cultural lines in multicultural societies. These same powers, their affiliates or transnational criminal networks may also take advantage of the societal distraction caused by the COVID-19 outbreak to launch cyber attacks against national infrastructures. Implications for Scholarly Community Make no mistake: with almost 1.8 million cases and 110,000 deaths worldwide at the time of writing, the struggle against COVID-19 is, as has been said in some quarters, likely to be the defining struggle of this era. The world \u2013 including Singapore \u2013 has to do whatever it takes to win this war, because there is simply no other choice. Once the dust eventually settles, one final take-away from the COVID-19 war would be that the scholarly community can no longer afford to think in mono-dimensional terms about interlocking security challenges. In 1999, the great Harvard biologist E.O. Wilson argued \u2013 prophetically \u2013 that the \u201cissues that vex humanity daily \u2013 ethnic conflict, arms escalation, overpopulation, abortion, environment and endemic poverty\u201d cannot be solved without integrating insights from the \u201cnatural sciences\u201d with that of the \u201csocial sciences and humanities\u201d. Wilson insisted that only \u201cfluency across the boundaries will provide a clear view of the world as it really is\u201d. Singapore should position itself to take the lead in such a quest for building systematic, interdisciplinary expertise \u2013 and in so doing prepare the nation for future national security challenges."

    "author(s)": "By Pradumna B. Rana and Xianbai Ji",
    "date": "No. 084 \u2013 5 May 2020",
    "content": "IN THE shadow of COVID-19, the global economic outlook has become very dismal. International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently noted that the economic contraction this year will be so bad that only a handful of people in the world will have experienced a similar event in their adult lifetimes. The global economy is projected to shrink by three per cent this year and the cumulative loss of global gross domestic product (GDP) over the next two-year period could be over US$9 trillion. Most advanced economies are expected to contract by about six percent this year. The first epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Chinese economy, has ground to a halt despite some recent signs of recovery. Slowdown of Physical BRI In the first quarter of this year, China\u2019s GDP fell by 6.8 per cent from a year ago, the country\u2019s first economic contraction in decades. Many BRI participating countries are also experiencing severe economic slowdowns and have requested for debt relief from China. Against this backdrop, the physical infrastructure component of the BRI or Physical BRI has slowed, for several reasons. First, with the ongoing public health crisis, BRI participating countries have put infrastructure development and economic cooperation on the back burner. Second, wholesale community lockdowns and factory closures, and the repurposing of manufacturing capabilities into anti-COVID-19 supplies production in some BRI host countries, have disrupted vital supply chains including those supplying Chinese construction machinery and materials. BRI projects are predominantly dependent on Chinese rather than local materials. Third, border closures and travel bans have adversely affected the flow of labour, and equipment and materials for keeping BRI infrastructure projects going. Chinese migrant workers previously working on BRI projects have often been quarantined (as in Singapore), repatriated (as in Iran), or temporarily banned from entering the country (as in Indonesia). Impact on Partner Economies As a result, Pakistan has put on hold the construction of special economic zones (SEZs) under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor as Chinese companies struggle to cope with the rampant human and capital disruptions during COVID-19. The development of Cambodia\u2019s Sihanoukville SEZ is being thwarted by similar problematic supply chain and labour-related issues. Physical BRI projects in Indonesia, Myanmar and Malaysia also suffer from delays and uncertainties due to the pandemic. China\u2019s fear is that the longer the BRI projects are suspended, the higher chance that they may languish in the end."

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence: Empowering Smaller Navies",
    "author(s)": "By Richard A. Bitzinger",
    "date": "No. 058 \u2013 1 April 2020",
    "content": "MANY KINDS of emerging technologies have the potential to shape and influence future military power and effectiveness. Few of these have attracted more attention than artificial intelligence (AI). As machines that are able to carry out tasks that traditionally require human intelligence, AI promises to revolutionise the way future wars could be fought and therefore determine what comprises military advantage. At first glance, it may sound that exploiting AI for military effectiveness will be the exclusive domain of large militaries that possess the resources needed to exploit such technologies. This need not be the case, however, and while many smaller states may not be able to adopt a fully AI-enabled military, they can still cherry-pick AI technologies to gain specific new capabilities. AI in the Maritime Sphere This is especially critical in the maritime sphere. Many smaller navies \u2013 especially in Southeast Asia \u2013 have, over the past 20 years, acquired modern warships increasingly equipped with state-of-the-art sensors, combat management systems, and communications. As such, these frigates, corvettes, offshore patrol vessels, and submarines increasingly function as forwardly deployed nodes in national intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) systems. Developments in AI could particularly improve these capacities for ISR and therefore enhance the abilities of regional maritime forces. For one thing, AI could greatly assist humans when it comes to collecting, processing, and interpreting the large amounts of data being collected by these new and more capable sensors in order to help produce actionable intelligence and aid in decision-making. According to maritime specialist Sarah Kirchberger, AI, together with other innovations like quantum computing, could provide the \u201cimmense computing power\u201d necessary to interpret large amounts of data coming in from a wide variety of sensors and other resources, as well as enhancing datalinks that would \u201cprovide connectivity between disparate units to allow a shared situational awareness \u2013 ideally, in real-time or near- real-time\u201d. AI could also power new sensor technologies, enhance the capacities and connectivity of existing sensor technologies, or degrade the cyber security of encrypted datalinks of the enemy. AI, especially if linked with the space and cyber domains, could therefore become \u201ca key enabler\u201d of naval capabilities in such areas as navigation, ISR, communication, and target acquisition. AI, Unmanned Systems, and \u201cMotherships\u201d Combining AI with unmanned systems could have a synergistic add-on effect on smaller navies. Many of these navies already possess unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and AI could greatly magnify the value of data gathered from long-range ISR drones, by providing faster information-gathering and -processing; this could effectively enable the real-time monitoring of difficult maritime environments such as the littorals. AI could also permit smaller navies to make more use of other types of unmanned systems, particularly unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). Most current UUVs are physically tethered to a surface vessel for control, and thus have relatively short ranges. AI would permit UUVs to operate with true autonomy, for extended operations (particularly important for carrying long-range ISR missions or offensive taskings). For their part, USVs could undertake surface-protection patrols \u2013 perhaps armed with a gun or rockets \u2013 or be used for as decoys or electronic warfare platforms (e.g., spoofing and jamming). AI would also enable maritime drones to operate in autonomous swarms, compensating for their relative simplicity. A 2019 RAND report argues that AI could permit UUVs or USVs with the expanded capabilities to function in \u201ccooperative multi- agent teams,\u201d which in turn could have \u201csignificant advantages over using a single, more sophisticated agent, particularly to achieve robustness and large-scale spatial coverage\u201d. The swarming of armed maritime drones could become an effective offensive weapon, therefore. In the process of combining such emerging technologies as AI and autonomous maritime systems, one model that smaller navies might consider is the so-called \u201cmothership\u201d. The mothership concept revolves around a main surface ship (e.g., a frigate) which in turn is linked to several different types of autonomous vehicles: UAVs for aerial reconnaissance; UUVs for underwater surveillance; and USVs for surface operations, including maritime surveillance, mine countermeasures, electronic warfare, and force protection/precision fires. Using these assets, plus other sources of intelligence, and linked together and synergised by AI, such vessels would have expanded maritime awareness and the ability to respond faster to potential threat scenarios. It is worth noting that the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) is actively exploring the mothership concept, in conjunction with its new Multi-Role Combat Vessel, due to be deployed in the next decade. Operating in Contested Environments Combining AI with increasingly more autonomous naval systems could greatly expand the potential maritime domain awareness of smaller navies. This is particularly critical when maritime forces must operate in \u201ccontested areas\u201d \u2013 such as the South China Sea \u2013 where, according to Danish-based defence expert Ian Bowers, \u201cthe early detection of illicit activity or threats is particularly important, where the early detection of illicit activity or threats is particularly important\u201d. Unmanned maritime vehicles, \u201cif networked correctly\u2026will be able to provide states with a consistent real-time aerial, surface and subsurface picture of their maritime territory and area of operations with less investment in terms of platforms and personnel\u201d. Overall, the application of AI could ultimately have a revolutionary impact on naval operational capabilities. As Diego Ruiz Palmer, defence analyst and NATO advisor, notes, \u201cadvances in precision location, targeting and strike, navigation, large data transmission and discrimination, and weapon-system range and manoeuvrability, as well as the growing importance of the outer space and cyber domains, are altering the spatial dimensions of naval warfare\u201d. To be sure, there are sizable technological hurdles to smaller navies effectively exploiting these new technologies. Issues such as navigation, command and control, and sensors pose significant challenges for AI, particularly for unmanned undersea vessels. Nontechnical issues \u2013 such as how much autonomy should be devolved to an unmanned system (especially an armed one) \u2013 must also be resolved. Consequently, the application of AI to militaries, especially smaller militaries, may turn out to be much slower and more narrowly applied, at least initially. Nevertheless, there are many areas where AI \u2013 and other so-called \u201cfourth industrial revolution\u201d technologies \u2013 can have a dramatic impact on military innovation and effectiveness. Even if smaller navies that may not be able to adopt all the possibilities of AI as sweepingly or as quickly as can large navies, they can still skim significant benefits from these technologies so as to have a real impact."

    "content": "PANDEMICS PROVIDE the perfect breeding ground for conspiracy theories, and the enormity of the current crisis is supplying ample space for opportunists to manipulate narratives and advance their agenda. Whether provocative ideologues, seditious fringe groups or violent extremists, the general goals are to energise support by demonising others and undermine trust in state institutions. Certain organisations are also capitalising on shortfalls in state-led responses by appealing to hearts and minds through social service provision and charity. An effective counterbalance to the influence of intolerant activists may not come from national governments but from more constructive non-state actors. As the coronavirus response increasingly stretches government capacity and public trust erodes, inclusive civil society organisations can step in to provide transparent communication and support. Finger-pointing, Rabble Rousing and Extremism The coronavirus pandemic is proving suitably malleable to serve a range of divisive positions, from West to East. Far-right groups in the United Kingdom are blaming migrants for the spread, while arguing that authoritarian governments are responding more effectively than liberal democracies. To some others, COVID-19 is a Jewish tool to expand influence and realise world domination. Anti-Chinese tropes have emerged in Southeast Asia, including Vietnam, where similar theories of China poisoning food imports have circulated for years. Comparable sentiment has combined with allegations of government complicity in Indonesia. One popular post claimed the Jokowi administration had designated 19 airports as special entry points for weaponised Chinese migrants infected with the virus. Religion is another flashpoint. Facebook users in Myanmar argued that a mural designed to raise awareness of the virus was really an insidious message from a Kachin State Christian pastor designed to denigrate Buddhists. While Hindu nationalists in India have scattered rumours of Muslims intentionally spreading the virus among communities. Islamist extremists in Indonesia believe the pandemic is a sign of imminent end-times, a theory central to the ISIS identity which was supposed to involve an epic battle with \u2018crusaders\u2019 in a small Syrian town a few years ago. Apocalyptic concepts have become especially popular among Indonesian jihadis in recent years, including the instigator of 2018\u2019s family suicide bombings in Surabaya. From Undermining Messages to Appropriating Services COVID-19 is placing extraordinary burdens on national governments to contain the outbreak and address an unprecedented economic fallout. Already rising inequality is set to worsen around the world, as millions lose their jobs and the wealthy exploit fresh investment opportunities. When authorities inevitably fall short of providing sufficient support, non-state actors and social movements with narrow worldviews will try to fill the gaps and win hearts. Some are well on their way. The Taliban released footage of its medical teams handing out masks and soap to people in an Afghan village, where a spokesperson said the group had also been raising awareness and distributing informative leaflets. Taking matters a few steps further in Lebanon, the Shi\u2019a militant organisation Hezbollah is operating testing centres, ambulances with ventilators and a 25,000 strong army of volunteers. In Indonesia, the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) has called on community authorities to take control by implementing their own lockdowns, defying advice from the government. Competing against state measures, FPI has provided disinfecting services in villages and community mosques. And an Indonesian pro-ISIS charity called Gashibu has been donating food to families and teachers struggling with the pandemic\u2019s impact. Transparency and Civil Society Safeguards The most promising responses to both division-seeking rumours and the exploitation of service provision deficits have so far come from civil society. Kawal-COVID-19, an initiative made up of data, communication and health practitioners, is providing accurate information on the pandemic in Indonesia. The group is partnering with other ground-up initiatives such as Masyarakat Anti-Fitnah Indonesia (Mafindo), an established anti-hoax movement, to counter COVID-19 misinformation. Another organisation called Equality Labs has released a deck of information cards in different South Asian languages for sharing on social media to combat the \u2018infodemic\u2019. In Brazil, the Coletivo Rapo Reto, an initiative focused on police transparency, has repurposed its platform to counter misinformation during the COVID-19 outbreak. Grassroots movements are also promoting tolerance and working to reduce societal divisions during the pandemic. The Gusdurian Network, which promotes interfaith dialogue and tolerance across Indonesia, has been active in providing basic necessities to those affected, as well as equipping community entrepreneurs to cope with the economic impact. A similar endeavour in Malaysia called #KitaJagaKita is mobilising suitable volunteers and NGOs and connecting them with particular people and communities in need. Division, Resilience and Inclusion In recent years, identity politics and structural inequalities have combined with an anarchic online public sphere to create and widen divisions in societies around the world. A number of movements and networks have emerged and/or grown by ramping up hatred towards respective scapegoats \u2013 whether defined by ethnicity, religion, nationality or political position. The COVID-19 pandemic appears to be accelerating this culture of blame, and one casualty in many nations will be public trust in governments to communicate accurate information, deliver support and maintain services. Subsequent vacuums will attract a variety of motivated takers, especially those who can tap into emotions through cynical propaganda. Resilience in the post-pandemic world may hinge on a government\u2019s ability to empower civil society actors by providing space, legitimacy, and faith in their contributions. Stronger relationships between national governments and grassroots associations would help to restore trust and potentially lead to more inclusive governance."

    "title": "Xinjiang: Problem Ahead for European Industry?",
    "author(s)": "By Frederick Kliem",
    "date": "No. 091 \u2013 7 June 2021",
    "content": "NUMEROUS HUMAN rights groups as well as research institutes allege that the Chinese government commits \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d against Uighurs under the banner of fighting terrorism. What China defines as \u201cre-education camps\u201d are, allegedly, concentration camps, where extinction, forced castration, and slave labour are extensive. Earlier this year, Canada's Parliament voted overwhelmingly in favour of labelling China's treatment of the Muslim Uighur minority in China\u2019s western province of Xinjiang as \u201cgenocide\u201d. This follows earlier declarations by the United States and some European countries. Germany stood out by not following suit. German Ignorance? Berlin has long caused frustration among those in the European Union (EU) \u2500 in particular the EU Parliament which largely sees itself as Europe\u2019s normative guardian \u2500 who believe engagement with China should focus much more on normative than trade questions. For decades, Germany has been viewed as dodging the problem. Berlin has more or less successfully been able to separate human rights issues from its important economic relationship with China. But in recent years, there has been a gradual evolution of German foreign policy, and policymakers as well as business leaders have called on German industry to gradually reduce the country\u2019s over-dependence on Beijing. Nonetheless, Germany\u2019s export-driven economy remains its Achilles\u2019 heel. For decades, Germany has been heavily investing in China, both in terms of foreign-direct investment (FDI) and in an unsuccessful gamble on a more liberal Chinese future (Wandel durch Handel). China is Germany's largest source of imports, most important non-European supplier, and its third-largest export market. That the German economy is doing reasonably well despite COVID-19 is mostly due to thriving Chinese demand. It is no surprise that Berlin was instrumental in concluding the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI), with which the EU hopes to level the hitherto asymmetric playing field for foreign businesses in China. The controversial CAI is seeing resistance in the EU Parliament, not least because of the deal\u2019s alleged ignorance towards human rights abuses in China, forced labour in Xinjiang in particular. But Germany is not going down the route of labelling China\u2019s treatment of the Uighur minority \u201cgenocide\u201d for now \u2014 not because of industry pressure but because the legal threshold for genocide is high. According to an expert committee of the German parliament (Bundestag), human rights abuses in Xinjiang are proven and unacceptable, but do not constitute a genocide beyond reasonable doubt. Supply Chain Accountability And yet, the parliamentary findings of human rights abuses will have wide-ranging consequences. Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz (supply chain due diligence law) is one of the many beautiful German tongue-twisters that dominate German bureaucracy. In June, the Bundestag will legislate on German liability for global supply chains. This new law was long overdue. It is unacceptable that large multinationals from the developed world profit from but do not take ownership of well-documented inadequacies in human rights and labour standards along their supply chains in the developing world, including child labour and the 2013 Rana Plaza catastrophe. The Bundestag now transfers responsibility for unethical practices abroad directly to German companies, who will henceforth be liable for breaches of human- and labour rights on every step of their supply chain, including third-party suppliers and contractors. There will be German accountability all the way from raw material to the end product. German Businesses in Xinjiang Berlin may not view the treatment of Uighurs as genocide. But the very high due diligence requirements and legal liability German companies will face as of 2023 will have a similar effect. A number of German companies are either directly or indirectly involved in Xinjiang. A British study found that Wacker Chemie purchases raw materials extracted by forced labour, and a yet unpublished study by the Bundestag finds that numerous German multinationals, including Adidas, Bosch, and Siemens, cooperate with local third- parties who equally rely on forced labour. While the law is ultimately a watered-down compromise, it is a good step towards making \u201cMade in Germany\u201d not only a label of high product quality but also of accountability. As one German minister put it: \u201cThe German constitution states that human dignity is inviolable, not German dignity.\u201d Following a French law to a similar effect, the German law will be the toughest in the EU; and it is only a precursor to all but guaranteed EU-wide regulation in the near future. This will open another front in the already strained Europe-China relations. Legal Backdoor Will Displease China Of course, the vast majority of businesses in Xinjiang do not rely on forced labour. But because China does not allow foreign investigations into possible human rights abuses on its territory, it will be impossible to verify with certainty which part of the Xinjiang-based supply chain is clean \u2500 an unambiguous requirement under the new due diligence rules. New compliance and reporting requirements will inevitably force many German companies to cut ties with Xinjiang altogether, perhaps even affecting overseas production facilities, such as Volkswagen\u2019s operation in Urumqi. How China might react can be gauged by its government\u2019s, and indeed broader society\u2019s, fierce reaction to a recent Xinjiang cotton boycott by some international clothing brands, who had expressed concerns about forced labour in cotton production. The reaction was stern as some Chinese consumers boycotted their products, and the local government suggested that a Xinjiang boycott could lead to an exclusion of these companies from the Chinese market. Genocide or not, ignoring human rights abuses and doing business in Xinjiang will become a lot more complicated. And EU industry will have to brace themselves for an urgent backlash."

    "title": "Female Suicide Bombers: Urgent Deterrence Needed",
    "author(s)": "By Amalina Abdul Nasir",
    "date": "No. 167 \u2013 4 September 2020",
    "content": "ON 24 AUGUST 2020, a twin bombing attack took place in Jolo, Philippines, taking 14 lives. Both suicide bombers were identified as women, one being an Indonesian wife of the first-ever FiIipino suicide bomber from the Abu Sayyaf Group. This attack marks the second female suicide bombing in the Philippines \u2013 and the fourth in Southeast Asia. This could be the beginning of a new trend of female suicide combatants in the region. It presents a new dynamic in militancy, which further suggests that gender-based work in preventing and countering violent extremism (PCVE) has a long way to go. Female Combatants in Southeast Asia In Southeast Asia, women have traditionally refrained from shouldering frontline roles in terror networks. They played support roles as mothers or wives, propagandists, recruiters, financiers and logistical providers, and sympathisers. However, in recent years, female radicals in the region have taken on combat roles as attackers or suicide bombers. This can be traced back to 2016, when Indonesian Dian Yulia Nova, together with her husband, attempted to detonate themselves using a pressure cooker bomb outside the Presidential Palace in Jakarta. Following this foiled attempt, the Surabaya bombings in May 2018 became the first attack in Southeast Asia involving female combatants. It was also the region\u2019s first successful suicide attack executed by a female radical, and involving immediate family members, including women and children. The second attack involved a family which detonated themselves at a checkpoint at Surabaya police headquarters; only the daughter survived. In January last year, an Indonesian couple \u2500 members of Jemaah Ansharud Daulah (JAD) \u2500 set themselves off in the Cathedral of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, in Jolo, Philippines. In May 2019, Malaysian authorities arrested a 51-year-old housewife who was planning to ram a car filled with gas canisters and explosives into a polling station in Puchong, Selangor during the country\u2019s general election, according to The Star, quoting an intelligence source. In October, a couple was arrested after stabbing Indonesia\u2019s former chief security minister, Wiranto, with knives and scissors. These cases suggest an increasing trend of female combatants in Southeast Asia, who are flexing their ability to undertake \u201cmasculine\u201d roles. Call to Arms The push for women to take up arms comes from radical women on encrypted social media and IS propaganda on platforms such as Facebook. For example, on an Indonesian pro-IS Facebook page, the depiction of a \u201cMujahidah\u201d (feminine term for mujahid, \u201cone who engages in Jihad\u201d) has recently shifted from a female radical carrying a baby, to a group of women armed with semi-automated rifles. This signals the increasing acceptance and encouragement of women taking up frontline roles. Such propaganda promotes the message to radical women that they are key to the success of their husbands and the ummah (Muslim community) as they have both agency and power in their evolving operational roles. This is also manifested in online encrypted platforms where some radical women voiced frustration at being sidelined and a strong desire to shoulder more significant roles in IS networks. This desire is seen in postings asserting that women should be \u201callowed to spill blood\u201d in the cause of IS. Missing the Mark in Gender Mainstreaming Groups like IS assert a gender slant in their appeal to mobilise women to their cause. Hence, as the number of female combatants gradually increase, there is a growing need for gendered inputs into PCVE policymaking. This approach, also known as gender mainstreaming, ensures that the needs and interests of both men and women are taken into account in the policy-making process. It factors in the different needs and conditions of both genders in all stages of policymaking so that policies benefit not only men but also women, and lead to better outcomes. This approach calls for security and law enforcement agencies to be more inclusive in their counter-terrorism (CT) strategies. Participation of women in the CT policy process and decision-making can help ensure that women\u2019s perspectives and issues related to radicalism and violent extremism are incorporated. These nuances in formulating and implementing policies are critical to counter IS\u2019 propaganda as the motivations of women to take up arms differ from men. A \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach by CT agencies is not the way to go. Why Regional Gender Mainstreaming is Slow In Southeast Asia, gender mainstreaming in the CT sphere is still a work in progress. The idea of female representation is taken at face value in some responsible government agencies. For example, in the National Agency for Combating Terrorism (Badan National Penanggulangan Terrorisme or BNPT) of Indonesia, gender mainstreaming can be strengthened. Despite having quotas to ensure female representation, female officers fulfill administrative tasks instead of occupying strategic roles to influence policymaking. Early this year, Malaysia became the first country in the region to appoint its first female counter-terrorism chief. While a significant progress, such appointments should be complemented with more female specialists at the forefront of PCVE content and programmes such as in areas of rehabilitation, reintegration, and community engagement and education. There are many reasons why gender mainstreaming is making slow progress in the region. Amongst others, it may stem from the ingrained gender stereotypes and the conservative nature of the respective countries. Until this perception changes, it will be a constant challenge to make progress in the greater effort of PCVE. To clearly address the trend of female combatants, a structured PCVE effort needs to be set in place. Government agencies should set the pace given their abundance of resources and expertise. Governments must also make effort to foster greater inter- agency collaboration. A structured government approach and authentic government-stakeholder partnerships \u2500 in tandem with gender mainstreaming \u2500 can prevent more women from falling into the arms of violent radicals."

    "author(s)": "By Loro Horta",
    "date": "No. 111 \u2013 21 July 2021",
    "content": "ON 2 JUNE 2021, President Xi Jinping told senior Communist Party officials to expand China\u2019s circle of friends and stressed the importance of improving propaganda efforts. Beijing seems to have finally realised that its image and credibility in the region and beyond have reached rock bottom. Numerous books and articles in the past had touched on Chinese soft power and growing sophistication of its diplomacy; from Africa to Europe to Latin America, China\u2019s prestige and influence was expanding. However, in recent years, publications on Chinese soft power have virtually declined. While the People\u2019s Republic of China has always had its share of critics, many Western media outlets were and remain biased towards it. The key factor behind the decline in China\u2019s soft power is to be found partly in Beijing. Alarming Neighbours China\u2019s image in the Southeast Asian region \u2500 its immediate neighbourhood \u2500 has weakened in recent years. China has territorial disputes with four of the 10 ASEAN countries, Brunei, Malaysia, Philippines and Vietnam while tensions with Indonesia, a non-claimant, have also risen due to overlapping economic zones. The Chinese navy and coast guard have engaged in numerous confrontations with the Southeast Asian claimants and built several artificial islands to assert Beijing\u2019s claims. Beijing\u2019s strong-arm tactics have led to ASEAN countries closing ranks with a common position on the South China Sea. China\u2019s relations with Japan and India have reached their lowest point in decades. In Europe public opinion on China has also worsened. While a BBC poll in 2010 concluded that China was on balance seen positively by 15 countries, Beijing is now viewed more with suspicion. In a 2020 survey covering 13 European nations conducted by a group of 14 research entities that included Chatham House and the Central European Institute for Asian Studies (CEIAS), China\u2019s approval rating was at an historic low. Overall, views of China are predominantly negative. Factors contributing to this shift included China\u2019s confrontational diplomacy and the human rights situation. On the other hand, Russia has the most positive view of China. While Germany and several other EU members have imposed tariffs on various Chinese products and demanded that China open its markets, trade with China is perceived predominantly positively in most countries surveyed, except France, the UK and Sweden. Beijing, on its part, hoped that massive trade between China and the West would make it more receptive towards Beijing and Chinese policies. However, as the case of Australia shows, the US$257 billion in two-way trade for the period 2019-2020 accounting for 29 percent of Australia\u2019s foreign trade has not stopped the two nations from plunging into a trade war. The COVID-19 pandemic and controversial allegations that China was not honest in disclosing the virus\u2019 origin was probably one of the worst disasters for Chinese soft power since the Mao era. Eroding Soft Power There is little argument that China\u2019s image is not in a good shape in many parts of the world. Can Beijing reverse this? While this will be hard, it is, however, not impossible. China\u2019s image took on a positive trajectory after it reformed from a Maoist state spreading revolution to joining the mainstream global economy and eventually becoming a darling destination for foreign investors due to its huge markets. While times are much different now, Beijing can still regain its claim of pursuing a peaceful rise. In 2002 China and ASEAN signed the Declaration of Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC). After some years, China and the ASEAN countries agreed to upgrade the DOC to a Code of Conduct (COC), which is due to be signed in 2021. If China was to reduce its expansionist activities in the South China Sea, this could lead to a substantial easing of tensions between China and ASEAN. This in turn will have a positive knock-on effect on relations with other powers with interests in the region such as the US, Japan and Australia. Greater transparency on the part of Chinese companies and the opening of more sectors of the Chinese economy to EU investees could go a long way at reducing tensions. As a German diplomat told the author: \u201cThe Chinese complain when we restrict Huawei in Europe. However, in China all telecommunications are run by the state.\u201d While the COVID-19 pandemic has somewhat dented China\u2019s image, its massive donations of vaccines, ventilators and protective gear have improved it in some parts of the world. Will a powerful China be willing to find a negotiated solution? Will it open more sectors of its economy to foreign investment? While only time will tell, one thing is certain: It will be easier for China to prosper with friends around it not enemies."

    "title": "Putin\u2019s 2020 State-of-the-Nation Address: More Power?",
    "author(s)": "By Chris Cheang",
    "date": "No. 013 \u2013 20 January 2020",
    "content": "PRESIDENT VLADIMIR Putin\u2019s latest State-of-the-Nation address to both houses of the Russian parliament on 15 January 2020 was a little earlier than usual. The single topic of import which stood out was his proposed changes to the Constitution. Hitherto, the president appoints the prime minister with the State Duma\u2019s consent. Putin\u2019s proposal envisages the Duma appointing the prime minister instead, as well as all the deputy premiers and other ministers recommended by the prime minister. Significantly, the president \u201cwill have to appoint them, so he will have no right to turn down the candidates approved by the Parliament\u201d. Strengthening the \u2018Presidential Republic\u2019? Putin stressed this step \u201cwill increase the role and importance of the State Duma and parliamentary parties as well as the independence and responsibility of the prime minister and other Cabinet members, and make cooperation between the representative and executive branches of government more effective and substantive\u201d. At the same time, he made it clear that \u201cRussia must remain a strong presidential republic\u201d. In this regard, the president \u201cmust undoubtedly retain the right to determine the Government's tasks and priorities, as well as the right to dismiss the prime minister, his deputies and federal ministers in case of improper execution of duties or due to loss of trust\u201d. Putin proposed that \u201cthe president also exercises direct command over the Armed Forces and the entire law enforcement system. In this regard, I believe another step is necessary to provide a greater balance between the branches of power\u201d. To ensure broad public support, Putin suggested putting the entire package of proposed constitutional changes to a referendum. \u201cThe final decision must be made only on the basis of its results\u201d. Putin\u2019s Move Not a Surprise Putin\u2019s proposals are not unexpected.In 2018 and 2019, Duma Chairman, Vyacheslav Volodin, a former aide to Putin seen as a close political ally, proposed that the Duma\u2019s power be strengthened, including in the formation of the government. In his 2019 year-end press conference, Putin himself suggested limiting presidential powers and increasing those of the Duma.Following Putin\u2019s 15 January speech, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev resigned from his post. He was subsequently appointed Deputy Head of the powerful Security Council. The PM-designate was Mikhail Mishutin, a capable technocrat who ran the tax service. His appointment was expectedly approved by the Duma. Mishutin is credited with having established an effective and well-run tax system. He met Singapore\u2019s Minister Mentor, Mr Lee Kuan Yew almost a decade ago during the latter\u2019s visit to Moscow. Fluent in English,Mishutin\u2019s articulation of ideas and clarity of thought about Russia\u2019s development and future was said to be most impressive. Putin to Retain Power post-2024? Speculation has been rife that Putin\u2019s wish was to retain power after 2024. This may entail integrating with Belarus in a unified state with him at the political helm or assuming a more powerful premiership in a new political configuration. The integration with Belarus appears to have been stalled by Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko dragging his feet on Russia\u2019s consistent proposal. A more powerful premiership in a new political configuration would be a logical conclusion. Putin\u2019s latest proposals have been interpreted as an attempt to assume the premiership again after 2024.He had held this position previously from 2008-2012 since the Constitution barred a third consecutive term. Medvedev, who was then prime minister, became president. Unlike the 2008-2012 period, the prime minister\u2019s post after 2024 will come with more power. Flawed Reading This interpretation, however, is flawed. There are at least three reasons: First, Putin\u2019s proposal to strengthen the Duma\u2019s powers is balanced by his proposal that Russia must remain a strong presidential republic, with the president retaining still wide powers. Second, his suggestion that the entire package of constitutional changes be decided by a referendum indicates that that he places trust in his people\u2019s view and decision on the matter.His approval ratings are still relatively high, despite the economic difficulties in recent years. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that a referendum would lead to the desired outcome. Thirdly, it is, therefore, more likely that Putin seeks to ensure there will be a real transition to a post-Putin era with a power balance between the future president and prime minister. Whether Putin himself might assume the prime minister\u2019s post is too early to determine. But one cannot dismiss the possibility that he would occupy an elder statesman role after 2024, by which time he will be 72. Second D\u00e9tente with the West? Unlike his past State-of-the-Nation addresses, the absence of any harsh language about or criticism of the West is indicative of his desire to lessen tensions. He is keenly aware of the important role that Western investments, access to markets, technology, and finance play in developing Russia\u2019s economy. He is equally conscious of the need to ensure that Russia\u2019s growing ties with China do not lead to an imbalance in Moscow\u2019s long-standing policy of not depending on either of its traditional rivals. Hence, the emphasis on the need \u201c\u2026for a serious and direct discussion about the basic principles of a stable world order and the most acute problems that humanity is facing\u201d. Putin\u2019s reconciliatory language with the West was clear in his offer \u201cto enhance cooperation with all interested parties. We are not threatening anyone or seeking to impose our will on anyone\u201d. To underscore that Russia was not behind the West or China in weapons\u2019 development, he observed that \u201cfor the first time ever \u2013 I want to emphasise this \u2013 for the first time in the history of nuclear missile weapons, including the Soviet period and modern times, we are not catching up with anyone, but, on the contrary, other leading states have yet to create the weapons that Russia already possesses\u201d. D\u00e9tente a la the Brezhnev era must have been on President Putin\u2019s mind when delivering the 2020 State-of-the-Nation address. Implications for ASEAN Russia\u2019s concentrated focus on domestic socio-economic issues and signals to the West for a lessening of tensions are to be welcomed by ASEAN. If they come to fruition, it would mean a higher level of political and economic interaction with Russia. Moreover, in the face of current tensions between China and the United States, a more active Russia in ASEAN would only benefit both sides and could lead to more balance in the region."

    "title": "Global Health Security: COVID-19 & Its Impacts Urgently Needed: Ecological View in Decision-making",
    "author(s)": "By Margareth Sembiring",
    "date": "No. 168 \u2013 8 September 2020",
    "content": "FROM THE start of the pandemic response, it was evident that the environment has been placed on the backburner. In the first few months, when the world was gripped by much anxiety over a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) supply in the market, governments\u2019 most common strategy was to quickly produce as many PPE as possible to meet skyrocketing demands. That PPE are mostly made of plastics, the arch-enemy of environmental campaigns, did not seem to matter at all. Likewise, fear for life has rendered the fossil fuel origins of plastic products completely irrelevant. The use of these products is at times justifiable although how much is enough is a matter of personal judgment for most people. The emphasis on meeting human needs, which is often done at the expense of the environment, however, points to a deeper issue. It reflects society\u2019s underlying convenient attitude towards the environment that has arguably hampered the effectiveness of various environmental protection measures thus far. Worsening Waste Management Inadequacy The world\u2019s fear-driven response to this pandemic, which has resulted in heaping plastic trash, will surely add up to an estimated five billion tonnes of plastics that had ended up in landfill or natural environment since 1950s. Globally, only 9 per cent of plastics ever produced has been recycled. This demonstrates existing inadequacy in waste management capacity that the pandemic response has evidently exacerbated. Not only disposable masks and other PPE are found littering the oceans. Around 15-20 million informal waste collectors who are often among the poorest and most vulnerable in the society also put their health at risk from scavenging potentially infected garbage piles. These observations suggest limitations in the human security approach to the environment. Considering existing complex environmental challenges and the race against time to meet the 1.5\u00b0C Paris target, a shift from human security to a more ecological perspective is needed. This is to change the way society utilises Earth\u2019s resources and enable effective measures to address environmental worries. Rethinking Human Security The care of the environment has long been seen primarily from the human security lens. Climate change is a nightmare because of disaster prospects and their potential impacts on food availability, stability and security, and other human needs. Plastic waste is a pressing issue because microplastics that fish consume will eventually end up in the human digestive systems. In other words, the health of the ecology itself is hardly the main reason behind the zeal for environmental protection agenda. The pandemic response has brought to the fore the tension between prioritising human needs and the care of the environment. In March 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) urged the PPE industry to increase their manufacturing capacity by 40 percent. This was to meet the world\u2019s demand of 89 million disposable masks, 76 million gloves, and 1.6 million goggles every month. Relatedly, the pandemic-driven instant rush for plastic-made disposable masks was projected to lead to a massive jump in global sale from US$800 million in 2019 to $166 billion in 2020. Unfortunately, the good intention to provide enough PPE quickly has overlooked the eventual repercussions on the environment. A similar response at the societal level is seen in the continuing use of disposable masks among low-risk populations. This is despite the WHO recommending their use mainly for health workers, people with COVID-19 symptoms, people caring for COVID- 19 patients at home, and at-risk people. After the PPE supply chain was successfully restored, reasonably priced PPE products can easily be found in the market. This, combined with convenience, hygiene, better protection, and other personal reasons, have probably led to continuing preferences for disposable over reusable fabric masks. A recent survey in the United States revealed that more than 70 percent of respondents aged 18 to 64 years had been using fabric masks. But around 60 percent and 35 percent of them had also donned disposable masks and N95 masks within the week respectively. Despite the availability of more environmentally friendly alternatives, it is again clear that the emphasis on human needs can easily trump environmental considerations. Integrating the Ecological Perspective Considering that humanity and the environment are interconnected and mutually affecting, an ecological perspective is urgently needed to complement the current human security approach to environment and climate issues. The ecological perspective means to be constantly aware of humanity and the environment sharing the same space on Earth. It calls for an integral consideration of pressures on the weakest in society, the environment, and other living beings, in every decision making. It means enlarging the focus beyond one\u2019s immediate needs and a willingness to bear some inconveniences in the spirit of solidarity for the collective good of the greater society. In the specific example of mask use, the ecological perspective will enable one to keep their fear and personal preferences in check and opt for reusable masks based on risk assessment. Governments can help by encouraging low-risk population to use fabric instead of disposable masks, or even regulate the use of disposable masks only for those who really need them. Similarly, as economies are re-opening and eager to rebound, an ecological approach will mindfully take into account the implications of a certain recovery strategy on resource use, the environment, and the most needy. This will be not only within national borders but also beyond, especially when global supply chains are involved. After all, we live in the same planet and environmental impacts know no boundaries as climate change attests. For a start, governments can consider applying concepts akin to private sector- intended Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) principles to make necessary adjustments to national recovery packages. ESG, as some define, is the practice of considering material environmental, social and governance issues in the investment process. The care of the environment cannot be exercised as and when convenient. Pushing the environment to the backseat and thinking it can be dealt with later are simply untenable. This is because of the enormous environmental stresses resulting from decades of it playing second fiddle. An ecological approach needs to be made intrinsic in the decision-making for resource use in crisis response and in the post-COVID-19 world."

    "title": "Tension in the Himalayas: De-escalation or Prolonged Uncertainty?",
    "author(s)": "By Rajesh Basrur",
    "date": "No. 042 \u2013 10 March 2021",
    "content": "THE LADAKH crisis was a low point in a relationship marked by a series of increasingly tense military face-offs between India and China over the past two decades. The first loss of lives on both sides since the 1970s and the occupation of contested territory by both raised the strategic temperature to an alarming degree, which appears to have facilitated the drawdown. But the de-escalation is incomplete: withdrawal from several sectors is still in abeyance and the conditions that led to the crisis remain largely in place. Besides, this has been a watershed moment. As late as 2017, it was still possible to be optimistic about the prospects for a relationship that allowed the two countries to enhance trade and investment relations even as their border dispute simmered. But it is now clear that a return to business as usual is improbable at best. Competing Perspectives From the Indian standpoint, China can no longer be trusted to exercise military restraint along the fractious border. While New Delhi has consistently called for the formalisation of the disputed Line of Actual Control (LAC) separating the two armies, Beijing has instead insisted on a final border settlement. From the Chinese perspective, India is building threatening links with states inimical to China, mainly the United States, but also Australia, Japan, Vietnam and to an extent Taiwan. Moreover, the reinforcement of India\u2019s military position in the region is a potential threat to the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, which traverses territory claimed by India. Both India and China are led by strong populist leaders who are unlikely to make the kind of give-and-take territorial concessions needed to resolve border tensions. The consequence is the sharpening of a security dilemma: each side acts to defend its interests and is seen by the other as an enhanced threat requiring a symmetrical response; and the two are caught in a spiral of antagonism and distrust. If anything, there is a real possibility that the confrontation on land may lead to similar face-offs at sea, where red lines are even less clear. The Nuclear Facet Two dimensions of the competitive dynamic have the potential to sustain or even increase tensions. First, the nuclear facet of the relationship has not been foregrounded by either the players or most analysts, but is of considerable significance. Tensions over the LAC assumed ominous proportions with the Doklam crisis at the India-China-Bhutan trijunction in 2017. The crisis involved the active role of the Indian military in defending the disputed Bhutan-China border on behalf of Thimphu. In the context of the January 2003 delineation of Indian nuclear doctrine, which affirmed India\u2019s right to nuclear retaliation against nuclear attacks on its forces anywhere, India obliquely provided a nuclear umbrella to Bhutan even though there is no formal alliance between them. The issue continues to simmer and New Delhi retains its commitment to defend Bhutan, though neither wants to talk publicly about the extended deterrence implicitly extended to the latter by India. Second, the nuclear facet of the Ladakh imbroglio was evident from Indian signalling by means of the flurry of nuclear and dual-use missile tests \u2013 by one account, one every four days during September-October 2020 \u2013 that followed the onset of the crisis that summer. These tests were preceded by China\u2019s test-firing of its DF-26B and DF- 21D ballistic missiles in the South China Sea, which would have been read as nuclear signals not only in Washington and the region, but in New Delhi as well. Finally, reports of China\u2019s use of cyber attacks to disrupt power supply in India\u2019s commercial capital, Mumbai, in October 2020 have not only highlighted the need for cyber deterrence, but also placed a question mark over India\u2019s No First Use (NFU) policy and the possible need to revisit NFU for cross-domain deterrence in case of massive disruptive attacks. The issue is likely to be debated extensively in coming months. Economic Interaction A second aspect of continuing tensions relates to India\u2019s economic response to the Doklam and Ladakh crises. Before Doklam, economic relations were on the upswing, with trade and investment rising steadily. After Doklam, they have shown a consistent decline. In 2017-18, according to Indian Ministry of Commerce data, bilateral trade touched US$89.7 billion; in 2019-20, it dropped to $81.8 billion; and by 2020-21, it is expected to fall to $60.6 billion. Similarly, Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) in India fell from $350 million in 2018 to $229 million in 2019 and is estimated to have dipped further to US$ 162 million in 2020. Though part of the reason for the downward trend has been the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, both sets of figures show the pattern as having begun well before the current health-related economic crisis. In addition, India in June 2020 banned a number of Chinese social media firms that were well placed in the Indian market, such as Tik Tok, UC Browser and WeChat. Since then, restrictions on Chinese FDI into India have been extended. There are limits to India\u2019s cutting down of links. As a major producer and exporter of pharmaceuticals, India depends substantially on China for the supply of inputs, primarily bulk drugs and drug intermediates (valued at $1.78 billion for the period April-December 2019). Ironically, China has now become India\u2019s top trading partner thanks to the attrition in India-US trade caused by the pandemic. India Reducing Economic Dependence on China? That said, India has embarked on a more wide-ranging effort to reduce its economic dependence on China by working with the US, Japan and Australia towards a restructuring of supply chains. The India-Japan-Australia Supply Chain Resilience Initiative is one such effort under way. India has also shown an interest in Japanese and US initiatives to develop alternatives to China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative. Japan\u2019s Partnership for Quality Infrastructure and the US-led Blue Dot Network both have the potential to reduce Indian dependence on Chinese FDI. Substantial changes in patterns of trade and investment are on the evolving agenda of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (\u201cQuad\u201d). While these are unlikely to yield a rapid transformation of the India-China economic relationship, they will steadily erode its foundations. Strategic and economic relations between India and China were till 2017 carefully delinked. That is no longer on the cards. What remains to be seen is whether the new normal will be better managed than the old one."

    "title": "Jokowi\u2019s Omnibus Law: Cure for Indonesia\u2019s Headache?",
    "author(s)": "By Richard Borsuk",
    "date": "No. 179 \u2013 16 October 2020",
    "content": "PRESIDENT JOKO Widodo wanted a quick fix to Indonesia\u2019s problems attracting foreign investment, and Parliament has given him the tool he wanted \u2013 but the leader now has a new headache on top of the giant one from COVID-19, and efforts to lure investors are unlikely to produce results anytime soon. On 5 October 2020, Parliament quickly approved a thick bill entitled \u201cCipta Kerja (Job Creation)\u201d aimed at slashing red tape and making it easier for investors to create employment for millions of jobless Indonesians. Based on the title, it would seem the new law would be welcomed \u2013 but the reaction has been the opposite. Resistance to Omnibus Bill The law \u201ctramples\u201d on workers and will benefit only capitalists and conglomerates, complained the chairman of the largest Islamic organisation Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) \u2013 whose past leader of its Syurah (Supreme Council) is now Widodo\u2019s vice-president. Amnesty legislation as a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d for human rights and labour. International\u2019s Jakarta representative blasted the Social media was filled with attacks on planned changes in labour and environmental policies. Governors of some Indonesian provinces called on Jokowi, as the president is more widely known, to revoke the law. And there was negative reaction in the streets, with protests in dozens of cities for three days last week, some of them turning violent. Crowds included students unhappy with Jokowi and some people reportedly hired to make trouble by individuals with political agendas. Still, there were thousands of workers who showed their disapproval of the legislation known as the \u201comnibus\u201d bill. Opposition to his initiative to win over investors is the latest in a series of setbacks for Jokowi this year. COVID-19 has thrust millions back into poverty and the country into its first recession since the Asian Financial Crisis more than 20 years ago. The need to jack up state spending to help the poor has meant construction of a proposed Indonesian capital in East Kalimantan \u2013 what Jokowi sees as a legacy project -- cannot start this year. The ambitious omnibus bill, in one go, amends 79 existing laws that contain overlapping or contradictory policies. Proponents of the bill hail it is a necessary effort to reduce cumbersome licensing requirements and paperwork in highly-bureaucratic Indonesia. A World Bank economist has said the bill would have the potential to \u201cturbo- charge\u201d Indonesia\u2019s economic recovery from COVID-19. While businesspeople generally welcome the law \u2013 and had the most input on its proposals \u2013 there has been strong resistance from civil society groups, who said they weren\u2019t able to give inputs, to proposed changes in labour and environment laws. Attention on those areas may have obscured how much ground the law seeks to cover. The independent Centre for Indonesian Policy Studies (CIPS) applauded changes in food and agriculture policies, including removing a 30% cap on foreigners\u2019 stakes in plantation, horticulture and livestock businesses. Jokowi: \u2018We Have a Problem\u2019 But a week after the bill was approved, it remained embarrassingly uncertain what the final version said, as it wasn\u2019t available and multiple drafts were circulating. The official reason for the delay: typographical errors were getting cleaned up. Under Indonesian rules, a bill passed by Parliament will automatically become law in 30 days even if the president doesn\u2019t sign it. NU said it will ask the Constitutional Court to reject the law, though it\u2019s not clear what grounds the group will cite -- and analysts doubt the court will rule the legislation is unconstitutional. The bill stemmed from Jokowi realising last year how badly Indonesia was faring in attracting manufacturers shifting production to Southeast Asia from China because of US import tariffs. The World Bank said that of 33 relocations, 23 went to Vietnam and none to Indonesia. \u201cWe have a problem,\u201d Jokowi lamented. He thought an omnibus bill would reduce what he called \u201cregulatory obesity\u201d: Also, he was sure of getting it through Parliament, having support from nearly 75% of its members. (He didn\u2019t have a majority in the first term). Jokowi wanted Parliament, which received the massive original draft in February, to act within 100 days. But then came COVID-19, and some stumbles by his government, which many saw as slow and ineffective in combatting it. In April, Parliament began deliberating the omnibus bill, and since September it expedited handling. Rigid Labour Market After the legislation was passed, Jokowi didn\u2019t say anything publicly for four days \u2013 during which anti-bill activity proliferated. When he did speak, the president said opponents were \u201cmisinformed\u201d and many \u201choaxes\u201d misled people. He challenged opponents to go the Constitutional Court to try to block it. One major focus of opposition is change to a 2003 labour law that was pushed by then-President Megawati Sukarnoputri, who was about to be in the first direct presidential vote (which she lost). That law gave workers maximum severance pay of 32 months\u2019 wages, one of the world\u2019s highest levels. Business groups have long pushed to reduce that level. Capital Economics, a consultancy, says one reason Indonesia has struggled to develop the labour-intensive manufacturing base that has underpinned success elsewhere in Asia is a \u201crigid labour market which makes it difficult to hire and fire workers\u201d. A draft of the new law reduces the maximum to 25 months, with the employer paying 19 and the government covering six months under a new unemployment insurance scheme. Opponents of changes in labour law contend the government could have detached the section from the bill and taken it up later, after COVID-19 has been contained and the economic situation isn\u2019t so grim. They also question how the unemployment insurance is going to work, with the government currently cash-strapped. Answer to Jokowi\u2019s Troubles? The answers to that and other questions about the law are supposed to come in the \u201cimplementing regulations\u201d for legislation. Think-tank CIPS sounded a cautionary note on such regulations. \u201cIndonesia is notorious for the slow or failed implementation of new laws,\u201d it said. \u201cEnforcing this new law across 34 provinces will be no easy feat.\u201d Jokowi said the implementing regulations will be completed within three months \u2013 which would be surprisingly fast for Indonesian bureaucracy. The chief economics minister, Airlangga Hartarto, has said Jokowi wants it done in one month. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible,\u201d says Yanuar Nugroho, deputy chief of staff to Jokowi in his first term. The wait for those regulations and the fact there are almost no visitors to Indonesia at present, due to COVID-19, mean it could be a long time before a bid to increase foreign investment produces results. A key will be implementation of the law, as investors in Indonesia need \u2013 and often don\u2019t have \u2013 legal certainty (kepastian hukum). The situation will remain fluid and attention will now be on Jokowi and the decisions he will make about the law."

    "title": "Russia & Southeast Asia: What Lavrov\u2019s July Visits Mean",
    "author(s)": "By Christopher Cheang",
    "date": "No. 113 \u2013 26 July 2021",
    "content": "SERGEI LAVROV, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, met President Joko Widodo and held talks with his counterpart, Retno Marsudi, during a goodwill visit to Indonesia on 5-7 July 2021. Following this, he travelled to Laos where he met President Thongloun Sisoulith, Prime Minister Phankham Viphavanh and Foreign Minister Saleumxay Kommasith. While Lavrov\u2019s visits to Indonesia and Laos were meant to serve bilateral objectives, his attendance, via a videoconference, at a Special ASEAN-Russia Ministerial Meeting on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of ASEAN-Russia Dialogue Partnership, also signalled Russia\u2019s keen interest in maintaining the momentum of Russia-ASEAN relations. Russian-Indonesian Relations In his statement at a joint press conference with Marsudi in Jakarta, Lavrov described Indonesia as one of Russia\u2019s key partners, especially in the Asia-Pacific. He also stated that both countries\u2019 leaders planned to meet and sign a declaration on strategic partnership. In the economic field, Lavrov pointed out that trade with Indonesia had risen almost 25% in the first four months of 2021 and that both sides would diversify trade through the expansion of cooperation in high-tech products. Both countries were ready to convene the 13th meeting of the Russian-Indonesian Joint Commission on Trade, Economic and Technical Cooperation and to start negotiations between Indonesia and the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) on a free trade agreement (FTA). (The EEU is led by Russia and comprises Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan). On efforts to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, Lavrov disclosed that Russia was ready \u201cto closely cooperate with Indonesia, including the possibility not only of supplying vaccines but also to discuss localisation of their production on Indonesian soil\u201d. Both countries said they \u201cwere convinced that vaccines must be accessible to the entire international community\u201d. Russian-Laotian Relations In Vientiane, during a joint press conference with his Lao counterpart on 7 July, Lavrov highlighted the strength of their bilateral relationship. This was on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the Russian-Lao Declaration on Strategic Partnership in the Asia Pacific Region. Both countries pledged to expand the parameters of their trade and economic ties and would hold a meeting of the Russian-Lao Intergovernmental Commission on Trade, Economic, Scientific and Technological Cooperation before the end of 2021. The commission was to address how the two sides could \u201cconsiderably expand our economic and investment cooperation\u201d. Russian-Lao ties in the military and military-technical cooperation were also highlighted by Lavrov, including \u201cthe planned deliveries of additional military equipment and materiel to Laos\u201d. Russia would also be delivering the Sputnik V vaccine to Laos, and review a Laotian request that \u201cin addition to commercial deliveries, a part of the vaccines be shipped as humanitarian relief\u201d. Russia-ASEAN Relations During his joint press conference with Marsudi in Jakarta, Lavrov pointed out that \u201cthere was no alternative to the principles of ASEAN centrality\u201d. He pledged Russia\u2019s commitment to \u201cconsistently defend the positions taken by ASEAN,\u201d and declared that \u201call extra-regional countries should respect the traditions of this region supported by ASEAN\u2019s central role\u201d. In an interview with Rakyat Merdeka, an Indonesian newspaper, which was posted on the Russian foreign ministry website on 6 July, Lavrov noted the decades of Russia- ASEAN relations which were raised to the level of strategic partnership in 2018. Lavrov was candid, however, in observing that \u201cunfortunately, the potential of economic cooperation is far from fully realised,\u201d while noting that a \u201cgrowth trend has reappeared this year\u201d. The promotion of cooperation with the EEU would make this trend \u201cmore dynamic\u201d, pointing out the EEU\u2019s FTAs with Vietnam and Singapore, with Indonesia working on this as well. Although over two million Russian tourists had visited Southeast Asia before the COVID-19 pandemic, Lavrov lamented that \u201cwe still do not know enough about each other\u201d. The development of humanitarian ties was designed to fill in this gap, citing the establishment of the ASEAN Centre in Moscow as well as a network of Russia-ASEAN research centres. Russia-ASEAN youth summits were also held in this context while the Russia-ASEAN Business Council facilitated the expansion of contacts between entrepreneurs of both sides. On Myanmar, Lavrov stressed that \u201cin our contacts with the Myanmar military leaders, we promote the position of ASEAN which, in our view, should be considered as a basis for resolving this crisis and bringing the situation back to normalcy\u201d. He also said he \u201cbriefed our Indonesian friends about our messages which we send to Naypyidaw in line with the principles developed by ASEAN\u201d. Assessing Lavrov\u2019s Three Objectives Lavrov\u2019s July trip to Southeast Asia served three inter-related objectives: first, to show- the-flag and remind ASEAN that Russia is serious about maintaining and strengthening relations; second, to lend credibility to Russia\u2019s oft-declared interest in ASEAN; and third, to impress upon Southeast Asia that Russia\u2019s foreign policy interest in the Asia-Pacific, which has been very China-focussed, was diversified, tangible and pertinent. These objectives have largely been met despite the limited media coverage of Lavrov\u2019s visit to Indonesia and Laos. The reality is that by virtue of their stronger economic links and long-standing political interactions with Southeast Asia, China and the United States would continue to loom large in ASEAN\u2019s consciousness and concrete cooperation, when compared to Russia. In assessing Lavrov\u2019s visits, a keen Russian observer of Southeast Asia, Dmitry Mosyakov, the head of the Southeast Asia Department at the Russian Academy of Sciences\u2019 Institute for Oriental Studies, said Russia could act as some kind of \u201can independent arbitrator\u201d that supports Southeast Asian countries\u2019 vision of the future of the Asia-Pacific region. In his view, the ASEAN countries\u2019 traditional balancing policy between the US and China was becoming difficult to pursue, amid rising tensions between the two powers. However, Mosyakov may be too optimistic. It is unlikely that Russia could play such a role, even if it sought to do so. This is not only due to its comparatively weak (vis-\u00e0-vis China and the US) economic and other links with ASEAN. It is also because Russia\u2019s close ties with China and estranged relations with the US would inhibit Moscow from being able to function as an independent and effective arbitrator. Since Russia-ASEAN economic ties have yet to assume their full potential, the task ahead for both sides would be to continue striving towards establishing a more meaningful economic relationship, which would then make for an even stronger political linkage."

    "author(s)": "By Adam Garfinkle",
    "date": "No. 110 \u2013 3 June 2020",
    "content": "\u201cTHINGS FALL apart; the centre cannot hold,\u201d wrote William Butler Yeats in a famous 1919 poem. Lovely poem, many said; but others asked Yeats to speak not of beasts slouching toward Bethlehem, but instead to say why things are falling part, to explain just how the centre is not holding. These were not fair questions for a poet. Yeats had no answers when he wrote \u201cThe Second Coming\u201d just as the Great War was ending in the stunning throes of the Spanish Influenza pandemic. He only knew, or rather felt, that things would never be the same, and he was right. History Repeating Itself We find ourselves in a similar quandary just a century later. Will COVID-19 \u201cchange everything\u201d, as many intone solemnly? It is in a sense a silly thought, for everything changes everything: The world is never in the same state twice any more than a flowing river contains the selfsame droplets as it moves ceaselessly to the sea. But we know why breathless remarks proliferate at a time of emotional piquancy and ambient uncertainty, and it is churlish to scold the bewildered. More important, the \u201cchange everything\u201d mantra is oblivious to context, which is the greater problem with it. Visitations of pandemic disease bear two kinds of impact. The first and ultimately the lesser kind is medical/epidemiological in nature. It is about the virus, bacterium, or parasite, as the case may be. The second and greater kind of impact is institutional in nature. It is about the collective human reaction to a pandemic in all its economic, social, political, and geopolitical forms. It is our varying reactions to great shocks, of which pandemics form one category, that matter most, and reactions are shaped by context. COVID-19: The Fourth Global Shock Consider that for Americans, and for most of the rest of the world as well by extension, COVID-19 is the fourth psycho-seismic shock of this still young 21st century. The first came about nine months in: the mass-casualty terror attacks of September 11, 2001. The second began in late 2007: the Great Recession, as Americans call it, the Global Financial Crisis as it is known elsewhere. The third came in November 2016 with the election to the United States presidency of a man totally unsuited to the job. It was a surprise so thorough that it included the man himself, who thought he was running a shrewd campaign-cum-infomercial for his flagging business. Daniel Boorstin, then the Librarian of Congress, wrote in the early 1960s that God curses those He chooses to curse by making them believe their own advertisements. The terror attacks of 9/11, and the reaction to them, destabilised the general American sense of post-Cold War optimism and distorted the understanding and application of American grand strategy. The Great Recession/Global Financial Crisis destabilised the general sense of confidence that American and wider Western political and business elites knew what they were doing, and the elite reaction to it called into question their basic integrity and competence. The election of Donald Trump was obviously a consequence of the two foregoing destabilisations, and the verdict it cast on the tenured elites of both major parties. It was also a symptom of something having gone wrong earlier and deeper in the culture. But Trump\u2019s election and the subsequent reaction to the Trump presidency have since destabilised the normative basis of American civic life. The Three Destabilisations The Trump White House has attacked less democracy than liberalism -- and it is the attitudinal underpinning of Enlightenment liberalism that defines American public virtue far more that the techniques of electoral democracy. The sum of it all is that respect for reasoned argument and for facts, humility in the face of open-ended, value-laden policy challenges, tolerance for disagreement and hence acknowledgement of a loyal opposition, even the sanctity of the rule of law itself, have all been debased in recent years. These three destabilisations form the context into which the COVID-19 pandemic has fallen. Yes, pretty much everything has changed, but not mainly because of the pandemic. Most of what many suppose pertains to the pandemic doesn\u2019t, and what does pertain is unintelligible without considering the context formed by the three prior psycho-seismic shocks. Few observers, however, stop to connect these or any other dots. This is a problem apart. Yeats lived to understand that the Spanish Influenza pandemic really did not have major effects on British and other societies. People wished so deeply to fast return to normal that forgetting about the pain and death self-fulfilled the wish. It was the World War, the war that catalysed the destruction of the European imperial world order, that bequeathed massive change in both domestic life and in global politics. New Global Dark Age or Harbinger of Progress? That was not visible in 1919, any more than the denouement of the Black Death in the middle of the 14th century announced itself as the final chapter of feudalism and the herald of what became, by our lights, modernity. Likewise, it is too soon to say how causal patterns will reveal themselves in our future. It is enough to know for now that the pandemic\u2019s impact can never be fully disentangled from the disrupted context that preceded it, and to which it adds a new layer of both anxiety and, in a descant at least, hope. It may be a side road to a new global Dark Age, but just as likely it may be a harbinger of progress, and a goad to better preparation for a future pandemic with a much higher mortality rate. We just don\u2019t know, and as much as people long to be told how their small worlds will change as a result -- what will school and business and travel be like a year from now? -- it is futile to speculate until the broader context assumes a less liquid state. Nobody can know what that context will look like a year or so hence any more than Yeats could have foreseen early 1921 from late 1919. What we do know is that through wise reactions to challenge we can meet fate more than halfway. We have individual and, more challenging to harness, collective agency. We and only we can \u201cchange everything\u201d; a garden-variety virus, even a particularly annoying one like COVID-19, cannot."

    "title": "Indonesia\u2019s National Mobilisation Strategy: Growing Deeper Roots?",
    "author(s)": "By Jefferson Ng and Sheila Jasmine",
    "date": "No. 023 \u2013 9 February 2021",
    "content": "THE INDONESIAN government recently released Government Regulation No. 3/2021 on the Management of National Resources for State Defence. The new implementing regulation provides the technical scope and executive guidance to the minister of defence to prepare for national mobilisation in a military emergency or a state of war. From a domestic security angle, the regulation seeks to bolster national resilience and build national character through citizenship education in schools, community, and the workplace. From an external defence angle, Indonesia intends to develop a national reserve system, composed of a volunteer military reserve force and a network of supporting elements, including expert personnel, logistic areas, and strategic material reserves, to deal with military and hybrid threats. The State Defence Programme The State Defence Programme is the centrepiece of Indonesia\u2019s civilian defence mobilisation strategy. It seeks to cultivate core national values such as Pancasila, the importance of national unity, and the territorial integrity of Indonesia among students, workers, and society at large. At this stage, the activities covered under the State Defence Programme remain unclear. The Indonesian term State Defence (Bela Negara) originates from a total defence concept that all Indonesian citizens are required to serve in their varied capacities to defend the nation. Given the legacy of military rule under the New Order, younger Indonesians today are still uncomfortable with the use of militaristic terms and prefer a stricter separation of the civil and military sphere. Currently, there are compulsory citizenship classes that disseminate knowledge about the Pancasila, the 1945 Constitution, and the obligations of citizenship. At universities, there are also semi-military clubs that provide military training. The State Defence Programme will likely utilise seminars and workshops as well as printed and online material to be disseminated through the national education system. At the community level, the programme envisions a network of community leaders who will be at the forefront of the outreach effort to meet residents, conduct cultural activities, and disseminate printed materials. Overall, the programme appears to be about using formal institutions and informal networks to disseminate the state ideology and patriotic values. National Reserve and Mobilisation The formation of a national reserve system is intended to augment and supplement the Indonesian military. Volunteers for the national reserve go through a three-month basic military training, are inducted into the national reserve upon successful completion, and are required to attend periodic refresher training of between 12-90 days and serve until the age of 48. The Ministry of Defence plans to recruit two batches of 25,000 volunteers in 2021 and 2022, with a goal to size the national reserve at around 200,000 in 10 years across the three branches of the military. Recruitment is likely to be decentralised to the various military district commands at the city/regency level, estimated to cost 1 trillion rupiah (SGD 93 million) for 2021 or about 1% of the defence budget. If the plan is fully implemented, mobilisation could contribute an additional 50% to Indonesia\u2019s current active personnel strength. Only the president can mobilise the national reserve with the agreement of Parliament in wartime or a military emergency. However, the regulation is worded such that the national reserve can be mobilised not only for external defence but also to deal with an internal military emergency, possibly including operations for counterterrorism, separatism, and disaster relief. Relevance to Indonesia\u2019s Defence Policy Nonetheless, the bigger question is whether Indonesia is preparing for the wrong fight. On one hand, the desire for a national reserve system is part of Indonesia\u2019s goal to develop military capabilities commensurate with its regional status and population size. With manpower costs constituting the largest portion of the defence budget, a national reserve system provides a cost-effective way to enlarge military manpower. In addition, efforts to build a strategic material reserve will likely help sustain warfighting in a state of war scenario. However, the problem of modernisation of the Indonesian military appears to be a more pressing concern considering the approaching 2024 deadline for the Minimum Essential Force, as well as the need for a stronger maritime presence throughout Indonesia's archipelagic waters. With defence spending hovering at 1% of GDP, limited resources could be better spent to invest in key military technologies and equipment. Indeed, in late December 2020, an underwater drone was discovered near South Sulawesi which was likely conducting an underwater survey of Indonesia\u2019s archipelagic waters. Indonesia\u2019s coastguard agency admitted in a public interview that Indonesia currently lacks underwater monitoring capability to track the movement of submarines and other underwater objects. From an external defence perspective, the national reserve system is good to have but not urgent at this point. Nonetheless, the recently published General State Defence Policy for 2020-2024, a reference document outlining the state defence strategy, highlights that the national reserve system is second in priority only to the Indonesian military. Back to Domestic Security That said, the national mobilisation strategy makes sense as Indonesia\u2019s main threat conception remains internal and domestic. Indeed, the Indonesian state was concerned about communal conflict, terrorism, radicalism, criminal activities, the weakening of the spirit of mutual aid (gotong royong), and growing apathy in society when formulating legislation on the issue. Thus, both the State Defence Programme and the national reserve system are part of the state\u2019s national mobilisation efforts to extend deeper roots into society. This is to monitor and respond to what they perceive to be genuine law-and-order problems plus a marked weakening of national and social resilience that underpins the country. While part of the national mobilisation effort is about developing the manpower, expertise, and material needed for national defence, it also serves a nation-building role and as an early-warning system to monitor developments in society that the state views to be undesirable."

    "title": "The US Assassination of Gen Soleimani & Its Aftermath Russia as Mediator in US-Iran Crisis?",
    "author(s)": "By Chris Cheang",
    "date": "No. 007 \u2013 9 January 2020",
    "content": "IN THE immediate and short-term aftermath, the killing of Iran\u2019s top general Qassem Soleimani in Iraq by the United States clearly stands to benefit Russia. Economically, the immediate oil price rise as a consequence of the conflict adds to Russia\u2019s state coffers. Iran\u2019s retaliatory missile attacks from Iranian territory on at least two Iraqi military bases hosting US-led coalition personnel have worsened the tensions and raised the oil price. Diverted Attention Benefits Putin Geopolitically, if US attention is diverted to Iran, that might ease the focus on the Ukraine, in the Baltics and Eastern and Central Europe and over other hitherto well- known differences between the two powers. Russia could, as a result, breathe more easily. Moreover, if the crisis deteriorates into open hostilities, Russia is in the best position to play the role of mediator. US and EU economic and political pressure on Russia would certainly have to be either reduced or gradually removed. The fact that German Chancellor Angela Merkel will reportedly travel to Russia on the 11 January 2020 for talks with President Vladimir Putin \u0336 at his invitation \u0336 on the US- Iran crisis, reflects this very possibility. Politically, President Putin\u2019s prestige and influence in the Middle East can only increase even if Russia does not play a mediator role. It is the only global power which enjoys good relations with Iran and other countries in the region. While its relations with the US and the EU have not been as close as they could be, they are not hostile either. The West would need Russia to de-escalate tensions with Iran, even in a non-mediator role. The price for the West would be a gradual decrease and finally removal of economic and political sanctions on Russia. Russia as Mediator? Russia is best placed to play a mediator role, or at least exercise a moderating influence on Iran. First, no Western country enjoys good relations with Iran like Russia does. Both countries have been working together in Syria to support President Bashir Assad\u2019s government in its efforts to expel or crush ISIS and other anti-government forces. Second, Iran was a beneficiary of Russian arms sales; in late 2016,Russia completed delivery of the S-300 air defence missile system to Iran, concluding an US$800 million deal signed between the two states in 2007. Russia had suspended the agreement in September 2010, to comply with a stricter UN arms embargo passed in June that year. After the six-country group known as the P5+1 agreed on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) to constrain and roll back Iran\u2019s nuclear programme in July 2015, President Putin lifted the ban on weapons sales to Iran and signed a new agreement with Tehran, sending the first shipment of parts in April. Putin\u2019s Restraint on Iran However, President Putin reportedly turned down a request by Iran to purchase the advanced S-400 missile defence system, in May 2019, according to media reports. Apparently, President Putin rejected the request given the worries about rising tensions in the Persian Gulf region where several Arab leaders are concerned about Iran's military capabilities. Moreover, Russia itself is not keen on arming Iran to the hilt. Nevertheless, the December 2019 Russian-Iranian-Chinese naval exercises, the first, in the Gulf of Oman and northern Indian Ocean, reflected growing cooperation with Iran. Tehran itself is aware it cannot afford to alienate either Russia or China if it is to deal with US sanctions and other pressure. With current tensions with the US, Tehran needs the support of these two world powers to restrain any further US military action. Third, since its successful military intervention in Syria, Russia\u2019s prestige and influence in the Middle East have become stronger. Its good links with Iran have not prevented the strengthening of links with Israel as well as Saudi Arabia, both of which are suspicious of Iran but need Russia to ensure a moderating and constraining influence on Tehran. Russia Loses in the Long-Term? While Russia might benefit in the short-term from the US-Iran conflict, it is not keen on any wars or an escalation in military action so close to its borders. First, it does not serve Russia\u2019s long-term security interest if Iran and the US were to go to war. Its porous southern borders where most of its Muslim citizens live, are likely to become unstable should Shia Iran call upon the entire Sunni Muslim world in the Middle East and elsewhere, to rise against the US. That cannot be totally discounted since anti-US sentiments in the Middle East still linger. It has been more than a decade since Russia\u2019s southern Muslim regions were finally stabilised after a long and bloody conflict. It cannot afford another destabilising development in those regions. Second, should oil prices rise too fast and too high as a consequence of open hostilities, that might lead to more economic difficulties in the EU or even China, Japan and other powers with which Russia enjoys strong economic links. A weak EU or China would perforce be more likely to reduce their economic ties with Russia. Impact on Domestic Politics Finally, President Putin\u2019s focus is on 2024 when his current term of office ends. He is keenly aware that he must stimulate economic growth beyond the current 1% to meet and satisfy his people\u2019s needs and hence secure their support beyond 2024. A war or escalating tensions in the Middle East between the US and Iran would only distract his attention and focus on domestic issues and not help him seal his political future beyond 2024. In the final analysis, prolonged conflict between the US and Iran provides Russia with the opportunity to improve its relations with the West and ultimately lead to a normalisation with the West as a whole. This has been President Putin\u2019s goal since 2014. He appears to be a step closer to achieving it."

    "author(s)": "By Loro Horta",
    "date": "No. 160 \u2013 21 August 2020",
    "content": "THE PANAMA Canal built by the United states in the first decade of the 20th century linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans is of vital importance to the US. The country is also the hub for US military operations, with South and Central America hosting several bases. In March 2018 President Xi Jinping visited Panama, nine months after it established diplomatic relations with China and cut ties with Taiwan. Shortly after, Chinese companies were awarded major projects for infrastructure development such as the construction of a US$4 billion high speed rail line linking the capital Panama City to the north of the country. Other projects include a $2.5 billion third line for the Panama City metro system and a $1.4 billion bridge over the canal. An agreement on direct flights between Panama City and Hong Kong was also signed. Washington\u2019s Reaction Beijing\u2019s gradual penetration of Panama has raised growing concerns in Washington. For nearly 90 years the US administered the so-called Canal Zone, a 16-kilometre strip of land on both sides of the canal running all its length. Panamanians had no jurisdiction over the territory, literally having their country divided in half for nearly 90 years. This was a great source of resentment and humiliation. In 1999 the US finally returned the canal to Panama and put an end to extra- territoriality. However, the US remained the most important political and economic actor in the country, retaining several military bases. China\u2019s growing presence in Panama has raised alarm bells in Washington. In May 2019 influential Republican Senator Marco Rubio warned Panama of the risks of growing too close to China; while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned Panamanians of the dangers of China\u2019s \u201cpredatory activities\u201d. The Pentagon too has warned of the dangers that China may pose to the Panama Canal. Following the May 2019 election of Laurentino Cortizo to the presidency, China\u2019s winning spree in Panama seems to be slowing. The $2.5 billion contract for the Panama City metro third line went to a South Korean company while other projects seem to be on hold. Numerous observers speculate that this was perhaps a result of US pressure. Decline of US Influence While many analysts have written on the growing tensions between the US and China over Panama, there has been not much attention on the Panamanian people themselves. Most analysis treats Panamanians as passive spectators at the mercy of the great powers. Whether the US will remain the dominant economic and political actor in Panama depends much more on the Panamanians than on the Americans or Chinese. If Panama has a history of neo-colonialism at the hands of the US, it also has a history of resistance. After all they did manage to force the US to return the canal to Panamanian control. Panama needs massive investments to upgrade its infrastructure. If China is the only country willing to provide such assistance, Panama\u2019s leadership will eventually turn to it. There are many examples in the developing world of local leaders who, when in the opposition, were critical of China, but upon coming to power, were not able to forgo the benefits of Chinese loans and investment. China is now the second largest user of the Panama Canal; Beijing\u2019s interest in the country will continue. The US is likely to remain the most important actor in Panama for the foreseeable future. However, it will no longer enjoy the overwhelming influence it had in the 20th century when it had an almost veto power over major decisions. Need for US Change in Attitude Panama\u2019s leaders are conscious that relations with China give them leverage in relation to the US and forces Washington to be sensitive to Panamanian interests. While pressure may bring temporary results, in the long run the only way the US will ensure its preponderance in Panama and the region is by treating its leaders and people with more sensitivity and respect. For decades the US dealt with Panama in a colonial manner, treating Panamanians as second class citizens in their own country. Washington held almost veto power over the country\u2019s foreign relations and on numerous occasions toppled governments that were not to its liking. One example was in 1989 when it invaded Panama to overthrow General Manuel Noriega whom Washington accused of drug trafficking. Ironically it was the US government that installed him a decade earlier. This sort of neo-colonial diplomacy is outdated and will not work with the current Panamanian leadership regardless of which political party is in power. Rather than just lecturing Panama on the evils of doing business with China, the US should perhaps pay more attention on promoting the merits of doing business with Washington. The US should be asking honest and non-patronising questions about the needs of Panama and devising ways in which the US may be able to help. China\u2019s presence in Panama and the region at large will continue to grow and will require more creative US policies if it wants to counter China's creeping penetration. The Panamanian elite is overwhelmingly US-educated and American cultural influence permeates all aspects of Panamanian society. Panamanians have a love- hate relationship with their powerful Anglo-Saxon friend. The US has legitimate interests in Panama and many advantages over China. It must use them wisely."

    "title": "The Global BLM Movement: Public Memorials & Neo-Decolonisation?",
    "author(s)": "By Paul Hedges",
    "date": "No. 127 \u2013 22 June 2020",
    "content": "AS PART of the global Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests, demonstrators in Bristol, United Kingdom, pulled down a statue of a slaver, Edward Colston, and threw it into the river. Police did not intervene, judging it the most appropriate response, no doubt given a peaceful crowd that included families. The atmosphere was one of calm and rational protest, even celebration, not indiscriminate destruction nor anarchy. Some responses, however, depicted the incident as \u201cthuggery,\u201d violence, and wanton criminality. The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Priti Patel were strong critics of the action, and have called on the police to prosecute those involved. Yet the Mayor of Bristol, Marvin Rees, himself of black African heritage, has spoken about his personal antipathy to the statue and echoed a general sympathy with the action. Decolonising Public Spaces The statue has been recovered from the river and is to be placed in Bristol Museum with explanations of slavery\u2019s role in Bristol\u2019s history. Colston\u2019s statue had long been disputed in Bristol, but wider questions about statues and memorials to historical figures whose actions now raise moral quandaries abound. Started in 2016, a campaign by Oxford University students argued that \u201cRhodes must fall\u201d), referring to the memorial to southern Africa colonial administrator Cecil Rhodes, which is now likely to come down. The Belgian government has also, in response to the recent demonstrations, taken down a statue of the infamous King Leopold II who used the Congo as a personal colony and whose brutal regime killed an estimated ten million Africans. Statues have also fallen in the United States and elsewhere. It has also raised the issue that systemic racism is not just a US issue, but is found in the UK and globally. Wider Call: Neo-Decolonisation? This is part of wider calls for a decolonised public space, including museums and other places where \u201cloot\u201d from colonial regimes was deposited. Such decolonisation challenges the way that white colonial (primarily North Western European and North American) regimes of power, knowledge, and control emerged over the last couple of centuries and brutally dominated the globe, including through the British Empire. The BLM and other movements suggest that the legacy of slavery, looting, and oppression needs to be acknowledged, especially as its legacy in racism and discrimination remain embedded at many layers in society. The monument culture that valorises those deemed \u201cheroes\u201d and exemplars is questioned as it validates many whose work directly embedded today\u2019s systems of discrimination. There are both those who support the removal of such statues and those who believe they should remain. Objections to their removal include such issues as the following: These people\u2019s behaviour was, perhaps, normal in their time, though reprehensible by today\u2019s standards, so is it unjust to judge them in this way; there are legal and democratic processes for the removal of such statues, and these protest movements are undermining this; it is wrong to erase history by removing statues as we should remember what has happened. Contesting History The issue of history and its memory is of particular importance. It does not concern just the past, but the stories we tell ourselves about who we are today. Against complaints that the BLM campaigners want to erase history, their attitude shows that they take history very seriously. A few weeks ago, outside of Bristol, almost no one knew who Colston was, but today his legacy is on many people\u2019s lips; and, if transferred to a museum, his memory will have a strong lasting local effect. Importantly, his statue, like those of others, are not simply a pristine history which has been passed on. Colston\u2019s statue was erected around a hundred years after he died, when Bristol\u2019s ruling classes were seeking a local paradigm of paternalistic philanthropy (he had endowed schools and other institutions in the city) in a particular social context. History was deliberately made when Colston\u2019s statue was erected, and recent attempts to place another plaque on the statue with differing narratives show disputes about narrating this history. The act of removing it is, in these terms, another act of making history. In this case, recognising the hurt, especially of those of black African heritage, who see slavers valorised in their city. It is a symbol that Bristol\u2019s wealth, today unequally shared between ethnic groups, belongs to systems of oppression that are still held up as exemplars. It is about how we tell history, not what history is. With this act, and the mayor\u2019s plan to place Colston in the local museum, we arguably see a far more powerful way of telling Bristol\u2019s history and its contemporary resonances. It is not to say that every statue people object to can simply be pulled down by whosoever wishes. But, there, the act has arguably demonstrated an aspect inherent within public the political of memorialisation. implications and social contestation The Statue of Raffles Singapore has not been spared from controversy surrounding the contested history of colonialism. As a former British colony, its colonial legacy has been epitomised in various forms. One of them is the erection of the statue of Stamford Raffles, the architect of British colonialism of Singapore, on the bank of Singapore River, the location where he landed in 1819. The current statue was erected by the Singapore government to mark 150 years since his landing. His legacy in the Malay Archipelagic region is much disputed, including his significance and connections to the East India Company, and some marginal voices would like to remove the statue. There was debate as to whether 2019 should have been celebrated as the bicentennial founding of (modern) Singapore by Raffles. Opponents questioned both the appropriateness of celebrating the colonialisation of their country, and also pointed to a much older history going back to the founding of the Malay kingdom of Singapura by Sang Nila Utama in 1299. Conversely, others felt that the coloniser\u2019s legacy was key to what has become modern Singapore and so had to be acknowledged. The state appreciated both views and finally decided to hold celebrations for a bicentennial that clearly acknowledged the arrival of the earlier inhabitants of Singapore centuries before the coming of the British colonialist. The matter was therefore resolved for the moment, not with the felling of the statue of Raffles, but with what is seen by many as an amicable and holistic celebration of the country's early history. However, future Singaporeans may still ask whither Raffles?"

    "title": "Asian Multilateralism in Uncertain Times ADMM-Plus: More European Engagement?",
    "author(s)": "By Nicolas Regaud",
    "date": "No. 044 \u2013 12 March 2021",
    "content": "EUROPEAN STATES and ASEAN are increasingly finding it critical to strengthen their security and defence cooperation. This is coming at a time of growing tensions between great powers, the weakening of multilateralism, an undermining of international law and the growing consequences of global risks and threats on international security -- terrorism, confrontation in cyberspace and at sea. in particular climate change, pandemics, Participation in ADMM-Plus\u2019 activities would be a powerful symbol of closer collaboration between the two groupings in this regard, especially given that ADMM- Plus is a platform that brings together the ASEAN Defence Ministers\u2019 Meeting and its security dialogue partners (hence the \u201cPlus\u201d). A Thwarted Rapprochement As early as 2013, France expressed its wish to be able to participate in the activities of ADMM-Plus. This interest was received with caution, as the regional cooperation platform created in 2010, it was argued, needed to be consolidated before being possibly enlarged. To maintain the dialogue aimed at bringing Europeans and ASEAN countries closer together, the question of participation by non-Plus countries, as observers, was discussed. The proposed platform was in the Experts\u2019 Working Groups (EWGs), with rules of accession established. France was the first to embark on this path, followed by the United Kingdom and the European Union. Each highlighted its strengths and in particular the added value of its participation in the activities of the seven EWGs under the ADMM-Plus and its expertise in the fields covered. ASEAN members\u2019 cautious reception towards opening the platform to non-Plus countries is evident in the two documents produced in 2017 and 2018 to oversee the process of participation in EWGs activities. Three conditions were specified for accession to observer status. Conditions for EWG Observer Status & Opposition Firstly, observer status \u201cis not a guarantee or a basis for eventual membership in the ADMM-Plus\u201d, an option only available for ASEAN dialogue partners, and a status that neither France nor the United Kingdom has; Secondly, observer status excludes access to EWG meetings and is limited to activities like conferences, workshops and exercise, with a maximum of two EWGs; this is also valid for a three-year cycle of activities and there can only be one non-Plus country per activity; Finally, for the sake of inclusiveness and respect for consensus, the ASEAN countries would submit the applications for agreement of all ADMM-Plus member countries. The question is raised whether such precautions and limitations were essential to allow the participation of three candidates. Canada had also applied, while that of the EU was not considered admissible, as the rules of the ADMM-Plus precludes the candidacy of a regional organisation. Unfortunately, two Plus-countries -- Russia and China -- opposed the three applications for observership, hindering the proposed expansion of the dialogue process with the Europeans. Way Forward? Against this backdrop, how can we strengthen Euro-ASEAN relations in the field of defence and security and unleash the potential for multilateral cooperation? There is no doubt that efforts must come from both sides, both at the political and practical levels. ASEAN, under the chairmanship of Vietnam in 2020, paved the way by inviting the European Union, France and United Kingdom, as well as Canada and Germany, which recently expressed its desire to apply for observership, to speak at the ADMM-Plus Defence Ministers' Meeting in December 2020. It is significant that ASEAN and the EU decided to enhance their relationship by establishing a strategic partnership, as this was one way to stress the importance of openness, inclusivity and ASEAN centrality. In 2020, a year after France developed its strategy for the Indo-Pacific region, Germany and the Netherlands adopted their own policy guidelines for the Indo-Pacific. This has created a positive momentum within the EU which is expected to soon engage in the development of an Indo-Pacific strategy. Think-tanks: New Space for Dialogue France and Great Britain have long been active in the region in the area of defence and security, having established close cooperative relations with most of the ASEAN countries. Moreover, the EU and its major member states, Germany in particular, should develop their regional security engagement. They should also promote their already significant contribution to regional peace and security as well as their relevant expertise in the fields covered by the EWGs, which are the two main criteria for participating in ADMM-Plus activities. For their part, the ASEAN countries could possibly reconsider the rules they have drawn up regarding cooperation with non-Plus countries in order to reaffirm the principle of ASEAN centrality. As consensus in this regard may take time, a parallel path could possibly be explored by creating space for dialogue between ASEAN strategic research institutions - which exchange on a regular basis through the Network of ASEAN Defence and Security Institutions, NADI - and equivalent institutions from the EU and European ADMM-Plus applicant countries. The work carried out within the framework of NADI contributes to the development of ADMM/ADMM-Plus by promoting a shared vision of strategic issues and new avenues of cooperation, such as the security impacts of climate change. This Track 2 mechanism is a welcome source of ideas and proposals for the benefit of ADMM. Establishing regular exchanges with European strategic research institutions would promote convergences in terms of strategic analysis, a better understanding of regional expectations and the added value of Europeans, furthering the dynamic of dialogue even beyond the prospect of European participation in ADMM-Plus. Game-changer? Of course, European participation in ADMM-Plus activities would not be a game changer. Despite the success and importance of this regional platform for defence cooperation, the volume of its activities is still limited and they focus on non-traditional security areas. But the question of European participation in ADMM-Plus -- even modest -- has acquired over time a high symbolic weight, and its realisation would illustrate a shared desire to face together global challenges of increasing importance, independent of the tensions between great powers."

    "author(s)": "By Jose Ma. Luis Montesclaros and Mely Caballero-Anthony",
    "date": "No. 043 \u2013 19 March 2020",
    "content": "UP UNTIL 11 March 2019 when the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, government responses mostly focused on preventing further disease spread by imposing restrictions on travel and movements of people. These border controls and lockdowns have caused tremendous economic disruptions. COVID-19 is bringing about a global \u2018economic contagion\u2019. In fact, G7 countries of the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Japan have committed \u2018to do whatever it takes, using all policy tools\u2026\u2019 to prevent both types of global threats. Dire Economic Consequences Signs show a COVID-19-induced global economic recession is imminent, with widespread travel bans, cancellations of major events and conferences, prohibitions of mass gatherings and shutdowns of cities and other areas. The stock market prices in several major economies have plunged severely and massive job layoffs seem inevitable. A study by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in early March 2020 surveyed 24 Asian countries to establish the impacts of the pandemic. It found that the region stands to lose 5.7 million jobs in the best-case scenario, but this could easily balloon to 35 million jobs under what they deemed a \u2018hypothetical\u2019 worst-case scenario. Yet, even this worst-case scenario is conservative considering that the ADB assumed only a 50% decline in outbound tourism from China, and in tourism revenues in other developing economies in East and Southeast Asia. These did not explicitly include declines in South and Central Asian countries. It is not inconceivable then, given nationwide lockdowns and community quarantines imposed in multiple countries, for COVID-19 to cause a complete lull in travel for all countries. Economic effects extend beyond the tourism sector. When people do not leave their homes and spend, businesses suffer badly, leading to closures and bankruptcies. Quarantine policies affect supply chains, effectively halting factory production. COVID- 19\u2019s economic damage will likely exceed the 2% decline in domestic consumption assumed in the ADB\u2019s study. Who Bears the Burden of COVID-19? These economic consequences are the collateral costs which society needs to pay to contain the COVID-19 threat. While the \u2018greater good\u2019 still lies in fighting the disease than in preventing recession, the problem lies in the fact that these costs are borne differently across class and income groups within countries. Unlike the middle class and above who may suffer some discomfort in their inability to move around, the situation is starkly different for daily-waged households and those who live from hand-to-mouth. In their case, not being able to work also means not being able to eat and meet their other basic needs. Poorer households thus face a bigger share of the burden if they do not have sufficient income to ride out the economic downturn caused by quarantine measures. In fact, further analysis using ADB\u2019s data shows that the hardest hit are individuals working in lower-wage economic sectors. The two hardest hit sectors, where most job losses occur, are in the agricultural, mining and quarrying sectors (34%), followed by hotels, restaurants and other personal services sector (23%). In the majority of countries studied, incomes in these two sectors were well below national average; for instance, in China, agriculture, mining and quarrying wages were close to half the national average wage, while hotels, restaurants and other personal services wages were less than a third of the national average. Worst hit are those working in the \u2018gig economy\u2019, as well as vendors and others in the informal sector, who have little or no protection or safety nets which include income support or direct cash transfers, food aid, and healthcare. Helping Business and Workers The domino effects of COVID-19 on the health of economies have put governments in the spotlight, particularly their different approaches in dealing with health and economic concerns. Australia\u2019s state of Queensland is planning to release US$16.5 million to help businesses affected by COVID-19 measures while trying to convince the larger federal government, which thinks otherwise, to do the same. In contrast, New Zealand is allocating US$5.2 billion for affected businesses, with another US$2 billion for income support and health. Apart from providing funding to businesses, a more challenging issue is whether governments should focus spending on expanding healthcare system capacity (for disease surveillance, mitigation, developing vaccines) or providing additional social safety nets too. The US previously focused on the former, with US$8.3 billion mostly for the healthcare system, but recently announced an US$850 billion \u2013 US$1 trillion budget that doubles also as an economic stimulus package that supports individuals and small businesses badly hit by the crisis. The UK, while previously an outlier with its \u2018herd immunity\u2019 approach, has also about- turned and in fact, already integrated US$14.5 billion to deal with the outbreak, in its annual budget. Singapore is currently mulling wage support, in addition to the initial US$2.8 billion stimulus in its annual budget. Meanwhile, Malaysia is allocating US$27 million to give US$137 per month to an estimated 33,000 employees earning below US$915 who could be forced to take unpaid leave. Urgently Needed: More Social Safety Nets Debates on whether safety net policies should be strengthened or not become moot and academic when one examines the gravity of the situation. For poorer populations, the risk of contracting or spreading COVID-19, and the painfully palpable certainty of not eating, is not a matter of choice. The desperation to go and find work could potentially trigger further infections, since lower-wage individuals are often concentrated in the \u2018high contact\u2019 sectors especially hotels, restaurants and other personal services. Clearly, there is a need for governments to urgently put in place safety nets now. It is necessary for government agencies to cooperate and collaborate with civil society to target the groups requiring immediate assistance. Business conglomerates have to join in to provide the minimum safety nets for workers while longer-term policy measures are designed and implemented. Neglecting the plight of vulnerable groups will result in heavier political and social costs in the long-term."

    "title": "The Global Minimum Tax: A Transformational Proposal?",
    "author(s)": "By Dipinder S. Randhawa",
    "date": "No. 065 \u2013 21 April 2021",
    "content": "IN A speech on 5 April 2021, the US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen endorsed the suggestion of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) for a global minimum tax on corporate income. The path to a potential multilateral agreement opened when Yellen consented to remove the \u2018safe harbour\u2019 provision demanded by the Trump administration that sought to make compliance by US tech groups voluntary \u2013 a major stumbling block to reaching consensus within the OECD. What a Global Tax Treaty Will Do Since October 2019, the G-20 has been negotiating for a global tax treaty drawing upon a framework developed by the OECD that includes a minimum tax rate and a new way of assigning how profits are to be taxed among countries. The OECD proposals were split into two parts: 1) global minimum corporate income tax rate; and 2) a new tax regime that calls for large multinational corporations (MNCs) to pay taxes to national governments based on their sales in each country. Acceptance of the deal by several OECD member states, including France, Italy and Spain, is contingent upon both pillars of the tax reform being passed. The endorsement of Yellen\u2019s proposals from the European Union, G20 members as well as the IMF and the World Bank was swift. The G20 is pushing for a multilateral agreement and hoping to unveil a proposal by July 2021. A stable international tax system will stop proliferation of national digital taxes, such as those under consideration in France, Spain, India and Australia, and mitigate tax avoidance and profit-shifting by MNCs. Estimates of the minimum tax rate under negotiation range between 12.5 percent and 21 percent. The reform aims at ending tax competition between countries and the use of tax havens by companies, described by Yellen as a race to the bottom, a self-defeating competition in which countries undercut each other in their efforts to draw foreign investments and jobs. In the process, governments deprive themselves of revenues, estimated at US$240 billion, needed to fund key public goods and services. The OECD plan applies to global profits of approximately the 100 largest companies, including US tech groups, regardless of physical presence in a given country or where it is headquartered. It taxes MNCs in consonance with their real activities in each country with tax liability determined by revenues in the countries where the MNC operates and has customers. Consequently, US technology companies in Europe and other countries will be taxed there rather than in the US. In return, the US would be able to raise more taxes from European and other companies selling to American customers. The proposals will deny tax deductions to companies that send payments from the US to related entities in low-tax jurisdictions, where they pay less than the internationally agreed-upon minimum tax. The Global Impact The ramifications of the tax reforms are of global significance. In the US, the proposals can address some long-standing inequities and imbalances in the tax system. Arcane regulations have long shaped the financial structure of MNCs, which exploit loopholes to save on taxes. As a result of continuing use of tax havens by US corporations, approximately 60 percent of corporate income generated in the US is recorded in locations outside the reach of the tax authorities. An IMF-University of Copenhagen study revealed that nearly 40 percent of global foreign direct Investment with a value of $15 trillion passes through empty corporate shells with no real business activities. While the share of profits in GDP in the US has been rising and the share of labour decreasing, the contribution of companies to tax revenues has been shrinking, while that of labour has increased steadily in recent decades. The higher marginal tax rate on labour than on capital investments induces firms to pursue automation, rather than invest in training and skills development of workers, and thus depressing real wages. A level playing field between capital and labour can induce companies to invest in technologies that boost labour productivity. By altering corporate ownership into private partnerships or S-Corporations, meaning US companies that are exempt from corporate income taxes, large firms further reduce tax liabilities. A minimum global tax rate will reduce incentives for tax arbitrage, and thus tax avoidance by MNCs, at a time when governments find themselves under severe fiscal pressures. The Biden administration proposals add an element of progressivity to the US tax system at a time when inequality has been increasing for decades. The COVID-19 pandemic has lent an added urgency to the problem. Governments have to date committed $16 trillion to fighting the pandemic and its economic fallout. As a result, government debt rose to 97 percent of GDP in 2020 from 84 percent in 2019, putting pressure on governments to boost revenues. The proposals dovetail with US fiscal policy as the Biden administration seeks to finance the $2 trillion stimulus package, and governments across the world seek to close tax loopholes, especially those exploited by the largest corporations. Plugging leaky international tax systems is an obvious target. The decision to concentrate tax increases on a relatively small group of companies is recognition of the winner-takes- all nature, especially of tech firms in the global economy. Looking Ahead Several issues will need to be resolved, including overcoming resistance from tax havens and the corporate behemoths themselves. The plan will need to extend to mid- tier companies and keep a check on exploitation of new loopholes. Countries such as Switzerland and Singapore that hitherto attracted investment partly because of lower tax rates will continue to attract investment with their superior world- class infrastructure and competitive liberalised services sectors. The setbacks may be felt by economies that deploy pure tax arbitrage to draw investments. Today\u2019s tax system was designed for an age when investment was primarily in physical assets, plant, equipment, factories etc. The G20-OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting action plan is a step towards modernising the international tax regime. It is cognisant of rapid growth in intra-firm trade, the vagaries of transfer pricing, the growing importance of services and intangibles, and the ever-growing digital sector. MNCs will of course find other loopholes and governments will use other carrots to draw investment \u2013 the imperative is to engender transparency and create a level playing field. The tax proposal is a step in that direction that could spur innovation, growth and productivity in an Internet/digital age. The proposal aims for fair sharing of the burden of financing government, ensuring that governments have stable tax systems that raise sufficient revenue to invest in public goods, and respond to crises, with all citizens fairly sharing the burden of financing government. This is not possible without international cooperation and transparency in reporting and monitoring corporate incomes. There is little reason for developing economies to not agree with the principles of an accord on taxation of MNCs. With the US and most of the OECD members on board, an agreement by late July is within reach, offering a much-needed boost to multilateralism on a challenge that has eluded a solution for decades."

    "title": "Biden\u2019s Corporate Dilemma II: Future of American Capitalism",
    "author(s)": "By Adam Garfinkle",
    "date": "No. 121 \u2013 11 August 2021",
    "content": "BEYOND ITS politics, the core of President Joe Biden\u2019s 9 July Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy is about the rule of law \u2500 antitrust law \u2500 to be specific. How appropriate, really, for what Samuel Huntington once aptly described as a Tudor republic, a republic of law and parties. Since the first signal US antitrust legislation passed the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, Congress and the courts have struggled to adjust the antitrust regulatory framework to changes in the American political economy. Episodes of activism surfaced mainly when plutocratic abuses burst into political salience, as they famously did around the turn of last century. Serious Policy Debate On Economy Such a moment has again arrived; it is a special one that combines heightened perceptions of corporate abuse, associated mostly with Big Tech in the public mind, with a sense of persisting economic doldrums for average income-cohort families. Discontent over sub-meritocracy wage growth stagnation, \u201ccost disease\u201d, consequent inequality growth and stunted social mobility now dominates serious policy debate over the American political economy. Anti-competitive corporate behaviours and either feeble or counterproductive administrative-state efforts to combat them are presumed to be a key source of the problem. While the angst is well distributed, its political voice resides mainly within the Democratic Party. That voice has taken a particular shape, with a notably sharp edge, in the still-young Biden administration. The history of American antitrust illustrates a bias at the heart of the evolved regulatory framework that the courts have relied on consistently for guidance: \u201cpro-consumer welfare\u201d. But the pro-consumer bias, which boils down to the utilitarian judgement that low prices are good, is a pragmatic bias, not a conceptually coherent legal principle. Big Tech: Good or Bad for Consumers? The gap between the two shows when, for example, Google and Amazon deploy their big-data information clout and platform dominance to squelch competition; but Google provides many services for free thanks to the offsetting power of its advertising revenue flow, while Amazon sells a lot of stuff for cost or less to gain market share at the expense of aspirant competitors. So are these Big Tech giants good for consumers or bad? Good in the short-term but perhaps not so good in the longer term? Tough call. A pro-consumer bias in antitrust made sense when basic scarcity was real enough and a developmentalist-inflected culture put its highest premium on the growth of material possessions. Note, however, that the pro-consumer bias has seen high wage levels as objectively problematic because they make goods and services more expensive. As bizarre as it sounds now, that is why the courts\u2019 first main target set after passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act consisted not of corporate cartels or even mergers but of attempts at union organising. American culture is now far from the end of the 19th century. Remedies for the protection of labour, notably the right to collective bargaining, have been developed outside the antitrust framework. But American courts have remained reluctant to slap the Big Tech (or Big Pharma or Big Ag\u2026.) companies down for their anti-competitive strategems. For example, in late June a Federal court threw out a suit brought by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and some state attorneys-general against Facebook, claiming that the FTC had failed to show that Facebook acted as a monopoly. New Legal School of Thought? The courts seem to lag ever further behind technology-driven shifts in market structures that exacerbate threats to fair competition, and new pro-egalitarian cultural norms that make the consequences of those shifts less tolerable. One result is that a new legal school of thought now explicitly questions the pro-consumer bias ensconced in US antitrust jurisprudence. The Neo-Brandeisian school, named after Justice Louis Brandeis\u2019s famous antipathy to monopolistic impulses, doubts that lots of people continuously acquiring more low- cost stuff is really the best, or only legally valid, measure of a healthfully competitive capitalist economy. It credits recent studies showing how industry consolidation simultaneously depresses working-class wage levels and helps engender higher costs in key sectors, the two effects taken together engendering a onerous middle class \u201csqueeze\u201d and growing inequality. For Neo-Brandeisians the ethical implications of market structures override any broad- brush or statistical measure of supposedly objective economic efficiency; their detractors see ideology over science at work and raise the spectre of stealth politicisation of antitrust law. At base, the burgeoning debate is equal parts political and philosophical; as such it is dead serious and it\u2019s here to stay, for a while at least. Anti-Merger, Anti-Low-Cost The enfant terrible of the Neo-Brandeisian surge, sometimes called \u201chipster antitrust\u201d by detractors, is none other than the current FTC chair who stood by the president\u2019s side on 9 July: Lina Khan. Khan, a 32-year old Pakistani-born, Yale-trained lawyer, electrified the antitrust legal fraternity four years ago with an essay in the Yale Law Review. Several of Khan\u2019s senior colleagues today in the Biden administration\u2019s economic policy offices share her views which, to simplify, are generically anti-merger and anti- low-cost, regardless of economic sector. The tempest caused by Ms. Khan\u2019s 2017 arguments has since become a howling storm with the Neo-Brandeisians\u2019 sudden rise to government tenure. A fuselage of criticism against them has recently emerged from nearly every American conservative organisation one can name. Most of it smells like stale cordite. But the criticism is notably broader than that. The long-reigning dean of American antitrust law is acknowledged to be Professor Herbert Hovenkamp of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School and Law School. Hovenkamp, who served in both the Clinton and Obama administrations, is hardly kneejerk pro-corporate. For example, he recently argued that the FTC\u2019s dismissed case against Facebook shows the inadequacy of current law in the case of the tech giants, and suggested that the FTC file an amended brief. American Capitalism At Stake? But Hovenkamp was no fan of Ms. Khan\u2019s essay. He commented in 2018 that her arguments are \u201ctechnically undisciplined, untestable, and even incoherent\u201d. Nor is he enamoured of the Neo-Brandeisian school which, if it gets its way, he believes will hurt more than help poorer, marginalised communities and thus in due course constitute political suicide for the Democrats. What matters for now isn\u2019t just who is right on the scholarly or policy merits. What matters is that President Biden\u2019s 9 July EO, read closely and put in political context, reveals the launching into a new orbit of a critical debate over antitrust law. The implications for the future of American governance at its political-economic core can barely be overstated. The ultimate viability of American capitalism, with its huge global significance pulled in train, is at stake. This, not details over American airline giants nicking passengers with hidden baggage fees, or how much less prescription meds may soon cost, marks the true significance of that EO. Alas, the great institutions and sages of American journalism have so far missed it almost completely."

    "title": "Mahathir 2.0 & China: Hedging in a Fluid World",
    "author(s)": "By Johan Saravanamuttu",
    "date": "No. 001 \u2013 2 January 2020",
    "content": "FOR COUNTRIES of Southeast Asia, addressing the ascendancy of China has been de rigueur for some time now. For the most part of the first decade of this 21st Century, the United States loomed large as the major hedge against a rising China with the view that it was the benign regional power and, indeed, the natural political and economic ally. This equation has been altered somewhat since 2016 because of the Trump presidency and the apparent declining prestige of the US in the region. Malaysian leaders have experienced both the periods of strong US presence in the region and its current decline against the backdrop of China\u2019s rise. The impact on Malaysian\u2019s foreign policy is substantive and visible this time around. Under the premiership of Najib Razak, Malaysia was quick to embrace China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), launched in 2013, with a slew of projects, including the multibillion- dollar East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) stretching across the peninsula, in effect creating a land bridge from the Strait of Malacca to the South China Sea. Still Upbeat? Under current premier Mahathir Mohamad, after initial hiccups, the relationship with China has remained upbeat. The ECRL was revived by April 2019, with the cost reduced by a whopping RM21.5 billion (US$5.26 billion). Several other BRI projects, such as the Bandar Malaysia, Malaysia-China Kuantan Industrial Park (MCKIP), with its state-of-the-art Alliance Steel company, as well as the Malacca Gateway were reinstated. China has remained as Malaysia\u2019s largest trading partner for the past 10 years with total trade of RM319 billion, is or about 18% of Malaysia\u2019s trade. China also rose to become its top foreign direct investor in 2018 but fell behind the US in 2019 possibly due to scuttled 1MDB projects. With China\u2019s Geely\u2019s investing a major stake in Proton since 2017, the national car has seen its sales rocket by 46% in 2019 and its market share rising to 18%. Malaysia is also on track to launch Huawei\u2019s 5G technology by this year having set up a task force for its full adoption by 2023. On the Huawei issue, Mahathir is on record as stating that the Trump policy was \u201chypocritical\u201d. In broad geopolitical terms, the growing China presence through BRI penetration into Southeast Asia has elicited a belated response by the Trump administration in the form of the US Indo-Pacific Strategy. The Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) strategy, announced at the 2017 APEC Conference is to be pursued through US military alliances and ongoing engagements with Japan, South Korea, Australia and the Southeast Asian states. Malaysia has followed the ASEAN cue through the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific announced on 23 June 2019 through an Indonesian-led initiative. While welcoming the idea, the document stated that the Asia-Pacific and the Indian Ocean were closely integrated, emphasising the importance of the evolving norms, principles and rules- based security and economic architectural structures that has been already put in place by ASEAN. Free and Open Indo-Pacific The FOIP may not necessarily devalue Southeast Asia and the Asia Pacific but importantly signals US concern with a rising China which it dubs as a \u201crevisionist power\u201d, a term that ironically could well apply a fortiori to the US today. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d posture has ushered in a possible decline of an American-led global order. If Malaysia and its ASEAN neighbours are now in a more fluid, multipolar world, it would be then quite logical to engage full tilt with China albeit with a cautious eye to Beijing\u2019s ambitions in the South China Sea. The ASEAN push in 2018 for a Code of Conduct (CoC) within three years is the primary avenue for negotiation with China in this area of continuous friction. A measured approach towards China should come with maintaining strong ties with major US allies of Asia. Mahathir seems to be on the ball, announcing a foreign policy that is \u201cneutral and friendly\u201d to all countries, noting that \u201cwhether they are communist or non-communist, it is of no concern to us\u201d. He subsequently added that Malaysia would implement a \u201cno warships\u201d policy or a warships-free zone in Malaysia\u2019s adjoining seas of the Strait of Malacca and the South China Sea. Such a policy could be aimed at the US as much as it is targeted at China. KL\u2019s Hedging in Fluid World Order As for hedging in an evolving and more fluid world order with an ascendant China, Mahathir has turned first to his tried and trusted friend \u2013 Japan. The 94-year old premier has visited Japan yearly since assuming power. This renewed \u201cLook East\u201d policy towards Japan for economic leadership and inspiration balances a heavy reliance on China investments. Engaging Japan, a US ally, to hedge against China indirectly also implies a subtle policy of overall hedging vis-\u00e0-vis the US. Such a policy also applies to South Korea, another important US ally. In his state visit to South Korea in late November Mahathir reiterated his call for Malaysian companies to emulate Korea by going global. Finally, for Malaysia and Southeast Asia, geopolitical developments have favoured a renewal of new regional economic trade agreements. Since the collapse of the Trans- Pacific Partnership (TPP), which Trump abandoned in 2017, Mahathir has prevaricated over ratifying the TPP's revised version, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), (which the Najib government joined in 2018), because of its possible impact on Malaysia\u2019s Bumiputra policies. Instead, attention has been given to the 15-member Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which has made significant headway in 2019. The trade deal, with India still demurring to join, will harmonise existing ASEAN FTAs with Australia, China, Japan, South Korea, and New Zealand. Even without India, RCEP countries will constitute some 2.3 billion people with a GDP of US$24.8 trillion. Outside of trade, India has proved difficult for Mahathir to handle given Malaysia\u2019s putative Muslim inclinations in foreign policy. The most fractious issues concern Jammu and Kashmir after Premier Narendra Modi\u2019s unilateral withdrawal of its autonomy status and the new citizenship enactment of India, both of which Mahathir has criticised. Mahathir\u2019s hedging diplomacy here is to rely on selective Muslim allies of the US, such as Pakistan and Turkey, to balance Indian hostility. In contrast, Malaysia\u2019s relations with Australia, a major US ally, has nearly always been positive, given that both states are parties to the Five Power Defence Arrangement (FPDA) since Britain\u2019s East-of-Suez policy of the 1970s. Mahathir in inimitable fashion has suggested that Australia will over time become \u201cmore Asian\u201d. In the current hybridised environment of a more fluid world order, Malaysia is well- poised to craft policies which capitalise on a rising China while hedging against this through maintaining strong ties with states such as Japan, South Korea and Australia as well as good relations with other major Asia-Pacific states."

    "title": "The Biden Presidency Politicisation of US Foreign Service: Institutional Decay?",
    "author(s)": "By Adam Garfinkle",
    "date": "No. 025 \u2013 10 February 2021",
    "content": "AMID THE exhilaration of the Biden administration\u2019s early days runs below the surface, like a sub-plot, the competitive politicisation of the US foreign service. A recent datum concerning the Department of State supplies a vexing example. Just hours after Chief Justice John Roberts administered the oath of office to Joe Biden as president, an administration spokesman announced a list of interim, or \u201cacting\u201d, departmental and agency heads. This happens like clockwork every four years: Apolitical caretakers occupy exalted thrones, warding off temptations to indulge in political chicanery during the transition, until new political appointees \u2013 Schedule Cs, they\u2019re called \u2013 are confirmed by the Senate. The list released on 20 January included several key \u201cacting\u201d positions including for the secretary of defence, director of central intelligence, secretary of homeland security, attorney-general (Justice Department) and the secretary of state. What all of these temporary appointments except one had in common is that these individuals were the highest-ranking civil servants in their respective departments and agencies. Politicisation of the State Department At the State Department the interim acting secretary is typically the under secretary of state for political affairs, simply called P by those in the building. (The secretary is simply S, and the deputy secretary D.) P is typically the highest ranking career foreign service officer, whose job involves, among other things, being the corpus callosum between the political appointees of a given administration. the career professionals and Typically but not always: The new P soon-to-be, Victoria Nuland, was a career FSO but retired in 2017 and is now returning to government as a Schedule C. Alas, by recycling retired FSOs into government as Schedule Cs the Democrats are not doing career foreign service professionals any favours. Yet another example involves the new deputy secretary, Wendy Sherman, who was an FSO, retired, and is reentering government as a Schedule C. Such behaviour plays into longstanding Republican accusations that the career foreign service is de facto a partisan institution, an optic that makes it harder for the State Department to do its job during even normal Republican administrations. In light of all this, one name on the 20 January \u201cacting\u201d list stood out. Dan Smith, tapped to be acting secretary of state, was not the highest-ranking career civil servant at State. That was David Hale, who has served as P since August 2018. But Hale was passed over in favour of Smith, a supposedly apolitical FSO who nevertheless accepted the role of State Department transition head for the victorious Biden campaign. Why? Between Appearance and Reality Hale was elevated to be P by Mike Pompeo and, unlike Michael McKinley, then serving as a senior advisor to the secretary, did not resign over Pompeo\u2019s failure to support Marie Yovanovich against White House intrigues and the general politicisation of the Department. Yovanovich, a senior diplomat posted to Kyiv, Ukraine, was the target of a smear campaign by then President Trump. That was enough in the eyes of the Biden brain trust, it seems, to throw Hale\u2019s career civil service status aside in what looks to have been an act of quotidian partisan revenge taking. Smith did the brief job without incident before Antony Blinken\u2019s Senate confirmation as secretary of state, but that\u2019s not the point. The point is that the insult to Hale is hard to justify on the demerits. Hale did his job as P as apolitically as possible under difficult circumstances. Moreover, during the November 2019 impeachment investigations, Hale\u2019s involvement was brief and not notably Trump-friendly. Perhaps Hale suffered unwonted guilt by association. After all, the Trump administration, true to its zero-sum approach to political life, attempted to politicise and instrumentalise everything it touched, including the civil service. Trump signed three executive orders in 2018 that limited civil service employees\u2019 rights to collective bargaining, cut official time, and prioritised employee firings and discipline with a proposed new Schedule F designation for senior employees. New Manoeuvre The Schedule F manoeuvre was a clear attempt to end-run the 1883 Pendleton Act that established a professional civil service and introduced protections from political harassment for its members. Alas, establishing a new basis for partisan harassment was the main point behind the Schedule F stratagem, which the Biden administration has already strangled in its cradle. Towards the end of his tenure, too, Trump abused civil service protections to \u201cburrow\u201d moles into the incoming Biden administration. (Except for its huge scale this was nothing new, however; the concluding Obama administration did the same to its different-party successor, as did the Bush 43 administration to the incoming Obama administration.) Just days before the Inauguration, the outgoing administration, via acting defence secretary Christopher Miller, installed 32-year-old Michael Ellis as general counsel (meaning top lawyer) at the National Security Agency (NSA). Ellis had worked for Devin Nunes, a strong Trump supporter in Congress. As soon as he took the oath of office Ellis enjoyed senior executive service status and civil service protection; he could not be fired. After two days on the job the Biden administration placed Ellis on administrative leave and launched an investigation into his hiring. Politicisation Crossfires Something similar happened in December at the US Agency for Global Media, colloquially known as \u201cthe radios\u201d. Trump hatchet man Michael Pack installed Victoria Coates, then Trump\u2019s Deputy National Security Advisor, as Middle East Broadcasting Network director in place of the much-esteemed Ambassador Alberto Fernandez. Pack also fired the heads of Radio Free Asia and Radio Free Europe, replacing them with politically agreeable subordinates. These jobs are not designated Schedule C slots, but Pack\u2019s own appointment and his own subsequent staff designations were nothing if not political. One of the first things the Biden administration did, on 22 January, was to send Pack packing, his three radioheads with him. Coates had signed a contract in December supposedly guaranteeing her two years on the job, so foiling this case of \u201cburrowing\u201d may sprout a legal challenge. It has already resulted in some stellar Orwellian language: \u201cThis is a shocking repudiation of President Biden\u2019s call for unity and reconciliation just two days ago \u0336 and a clear violation of ... my employment contracts,\u201d said Coates, adding that the new administration should \u201cdo the right thing and not play politics with this important institution, which is generously funded by American taxpayers\u201d. This gives new meaning to the term chutzpah, since Coates\u2019 \u201cplaying politics\u201d complaint does not reflect well on her own minor place in history. But it does reflect poorly on the Biden administration\u2019s treatment of David Hale. The foreign service and its appurtenances have plenty of problems as it is; getting caught in politicisation crossfires will not improve matters for these institutions or the American taxpayer. Institutional decay in US government institutions is uneven but pervasive. The problem, while less acute prior to the past four years, is nevertheless outliving the Trump era."

    "title": "Indonesia: Perennial Issue of Terrorist Recidivism",
    "author(s)": "By Noor Huda Ismail",
    "date": "No. 080 \u2013 30 April 2020",
    "content": "AS COVID-19 continues to blanket countries around the world, Indonesia has faced a surge in coronavirus cases. With the government preoccupied by the burgeoning domestic health crisis, there have been opportunistic calls from local terrorist networks for followers to launch fresh attacks in the country. The surge in online activity of extremist groups has so far not been matched by a noticeable uptick in plots. Still, a recent incident saw two local ISIS-affiliated terrorists ambush and attempt to kill a member of the Indonesian National Police in broad daylight in Poso, Central Sulawesi. Two Critical Questions The 15 April 2020 attack, which resulted in both perpetrators being killed in a shootout with the police, took place only days after the release of an ISIS fatwa. Published in its weekly editorial newsletter, An-Naba, the fatwa called on ISIS\u2019 followers and sympathisers to launch attacks in the name of the \u201ccaliphate\u201d and capitalise on its enemies\u2019 preoccupation with the COVID-19 outbreak. It was subsequently revealed that one of the Poso attackers, Ali, alias Darwin Gobel, had been on the radar of Indonesian law enforcement, having previously been convicted for planning a terrorist attack in Toli-Toli, Central Sulawesi in 2017. Released after serving a two-year prison term, it appears Ali lapsed back into extremism and reoffended. Indonesian National Counterterrorism Agency (BNPT) sources have revealed to this author that Ali had been engaged in deradicalisation programmes, when he was in prison. His case casts a fresh spotlight on Indonesia\u2019s programmes to manage extremists, including prison-based deradicalisation initiatives. It also raises two critical questions: was Ali\u2019s re-engagement in terrorism preventable, and to what extent was he inspired by the recent fatwa issued by ISIS? Such questions are timely, given that Indonesia\u2019s deradicalisation programmes -- which involve various agencies, including BNPT and some private sector NGOs -- have had varied results, with recidivism not uncommon. Ali is believed to be one of over 50 recidivists among an estimated 850 terrorists who have been released from prison since 2002. Vexing Issue Another vexing issue has been the lack of effective risk assessment and monitoring strategies both within and outside prisons. With at least a hundred terrorist offenders expected to be released from the prison facilities scattered across the country over the next twelve months, this deluge will exacerbate security risks. Remitted sentences for good behaviour are common in the Indonesian justice system. In this context, some terrorist inmates view participation in the various prison-based deradicalisation programmes as a necessary cost in order to secure an early release; they would appear to be willing participants, while remaining ideologically hardened. At the other end of the spectrum, more radicalised inmates may perceive such programmes as disadvantageous to them as individuals as well as their wider cause. Such individuals would refuse to be engaged, arguing that as a mujahid (jihadist), it is taboo for them to accept any kind of prison programme from the \u2018thagut\u2019 (oppressor), in this case, the Indonesian government. During his incarceration, Ali appeared to be cooperative while participating in the prison-run programmes. However, he continued to be exposed to indoctrination by a senior ISIS inmate. His participation in the recent Poso attack appears to indicate an escalation in his ideological commitment to jihad, compared to 2017, when he was arrested for his peripheral role in planning a terrorist act. Upon his release from prison in 2019, Ali began, within nine months, to renew his contacts with former social networks actively involved in terrorism. He turned to them apparently after facing rejection and humiliation from mainstream society. He had tried to start a business but it did not work out. Encouragement for recidivism is also present in extremist media outlets such as An- Naba, which provides the inspiration, ideological justifications and praise for all released terrorist inmates by referring to them as mujahid. How to Stop Cycle of Recidivism? Anecdotally speaking, and based on this author\u2019s years of field experience in the domain of terrorist rehabilitation, the first-year post-release is when many terrorist offenders actively find themselves weighing up the costs and benefits of returning to the terrorist fold as opposed to starting life afresh. Those able to get the right support from their families, friends or local NGOs, tend to stand a better chance of permanently disengaging from militancy and starting afresh. Yet, the process of cutting oneself off from old social networks is easier said than done. Extremist groups offer \u201cspiritual sanctuaries\u201d for former offenders, making them feel both protected and cared for at the same time. Many can find stepping away a daunting prospect, especially if it means acting \u2018worldly\u2019 (secular) rather than according to their interpretation of their faith. For Ali, a ready-made radical milieu presented itself in Poso, with the region long considered a traditional recruiting ground for extremist groups, and known for sectarian violence. Need for Post-Release Monitoring Programmes Several released terrorists who later lapsed into terrorist activity typically served short sentences (less than five years) \u2013 a period that may be insufficient for them to be effectively disengaged and deradicalised. Going forward, the authorities may want to consider administering longer sentences for terrorist offenders to allow the authorities enough time to set them on the right path, while also serving as a deterrence for other would-be extremists. Larger investment should also be made in upgrading capacities among BNPT prison staff, such that the daily activities they conduct in the prisons can be scaled up more effectively. Crucially, there must be active detection and prevention of in-prison radicalisation efforts by ISIS \u2018preachers\u2019 and ideologues. Staff also need to be trained to detect early signs of re-radicalisation among inmates. Post-release, two types of monitoring programmes may be necessary. The first involves \u201copen monitoring\u201d, whereby local government in the respective regions as well as grassroots organisations and NGOs at the community level assist with the social re-integration of former inmates. In the second relevant authorities must take steps to closely monitor newly released inmates, given their vulnerabilities and possibility of re-joining their old extremist networks within a year of release. In Indonesia and around the world, terrorist groups such as ISIS will continue to exploit the present restive atmosphere to carry out fresh attacks. Newly-released terrorist offenders present a significant at-risk group for whom a coordinated response from various agencies is required, given their higher propensity for recidivism."

    "content": "CHINA AND the United States are apparently racing to emerge on top after the COVID-19 storm passes. But it is Beijing that seems to have a more coherent and sophisticated strategy. While China came under widespread criticism over its initial handling of the crisis, particularly damning were its alleged attempts at covering up the real extent of the infectious disease. China\u2019s strong and radical containment measures were regarded as typically authoritarian in a tightly-controlled communist state. Information was curtailed and official actions not accountable to its population. However, the restrictive regime led to an eventual stabilisation of the COVID-19 outbreak. The Chinese government\u2019s capacity for social and administrative mobilisation in times of crisis has allowed it to impose seemingly draconian measures that western democracies are reluctant to undertake. Changing Perception of China\u2019s Approach? While many in the West initially criticised the Chinese state\u2019s heavy and supposedly undemocratic measures, China\u2019s apparent success in containing the COVID-19 outbreak may have largely muted its critics. In both the developed and developing countries, many saw China\u2019s strong measures as necessary and questioned the ability of democratic systems to handle such an unprecedented crisis. The fact that developed European nations such as Italy with a population 23 times smaller than China\u2019s had suffered five times more fatalities seems to further reinforce the perception of the inadequacy of western democracies compared with the responsiveness of the communist system in China. Very shortly after the COVID-19 situation in China began to stabilise in mid-March 2020, Beijing sent a team of doctors to assist Italy, which was then the most affected country in the world. Chinese specialists were soon sent to other European countries such as Spain and France. The European Union (EU) thanked China for donating protective masks and coronavirus testing kits. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez thanked China for its support and expressed the need for deeper cooperation \u2500 this coming at a time when trans-Atlantic relations are fraught with tension. Comparing China and US Responses to Pandemic China has also sent medicines, masks, gloves and other equipment to several South American and Asian countries. These initiatives gained positive media coverage in the receiving countries. Unlike the Trump administration, the Chinese leadership is very sensitive to world opinion and the way in which China is portrayed in the international media. In contrast to Beijing\u2019s diplomacy to undo the damage of its early response to the pandemic, the Trump administration seems to care less about what other nations think. The constant contradictions between President Donald Trump and the Governor of New York State Andrew Cuomo, and between Trump and his scientific advisers as well as leading research institutions in the US conveyed to world audiences the impression of an erratic leader in charge at the White House in Washington DC. Governor Cuomo has received favourable comments in both the US and international media. While President Trump regularly dispenses abuse to China, federal agencies and individual state authorities in the US are buying personal protective equipment (PPE) from China such as masks and gloves. Trump himself is also seen as fanning certain conspiratorial theories on the origins of COVID-19. Trump\u2019s Fumble on COVID-19 Perhaps the most damaging to US prestige and global leadership was President Trump\u2019s decision to stop US funding for the WHO. He accused the organisation of not doing the job it was tasked to perform because it was too concerned with Chinese sensitivities. From the EU to the African Union, the criticism against Trump\u2019s move was loud and clear. The WHO and EU leaders, including those of Germany and France, called for unity in fighting the pandemic. During one of his media briefings at the White House last week, President Trump suggested that people should be injected with household disinfectant, leading some to question his mental state. The perception is growing that the President has lost his ability to dictate the narrative of his administration\u2019s fight against COVID-19 and the economic devastation from the spread of the coronavirus. While China may have made serious mistakes in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, and will pay a heavy price for the blunder, the fact of the matter is that 10 times more people have died so far in the US from this coronavirus than in China. The US population is today at more than 330 million whereas China has over 1.4 billion people. While China appears to have controlled the fatalities from COVID-19, the number in the US is still rising by the thousand every day. The messaging coming from the Chinese government is that it has done a much better job at protecting its people than most western democracies. While certain countries in the West have criticised China of taking undemocratic measures to tackle COVID-19, these same countries have ended up adopting the same tactics to fight the disease, just that they did so much later. Absence of US Global Leadership It is still too early to determine whether China has mitigated most of the damage to its image following the COVID-19 outbreak. While many have accused China of using its coronavirus aid to boost its influence on the world stage, such as seen in the so-called \u201cmask diplomacy\u201d, China has only assumed this role in response to the requests of the affected nations which are all in critical need of PPE, test kits and medicines. There is also a huge vacuum arising from an absent US leadership as the White House seemed preoccupied with the COVID-19 threat domestically. The COVID-19 pandemic is a global problem and will require global solutions. So far, the US president has focussed on his own country and its challenges in the face of increasing infected cases and fatalities. Yet, in these dangerous times, the world has been expecting US leadership and solidarity as in past crises encountered by the global community. Unfortunately, the goal of \u201cMaking America Great Again\u201d also means nationalistic and isolationist policies taking charge even when the planet is confronted with a never-before infectious disease killing people indiscriminately."

    "content": "RUSSO-CHINESE relations appear to be on an upward path, as seen from last week\u2019s visit to Moscow of Yang Jiechi, a senior CCP official, to attend the 16th strategic and security consultations between the two countries. His presence in Moscow on 24-25 May just a few weeks before the 16 June Geneva Summit between Presidents Vladimir Putin and Joseph Biden is an effort by both sides to signal to the United States that it cannot drive a wedge between them. Indeed, the following indicators appear to augur well for their future relationship: Overall Bilateral Links Yang\u2019s visit portrayed China\u2019s growing bilateral relationship with Russia. His host was Nikolai Patrushev, Secretary of the Security Council, who is said to be a member of Putin\u2019s inner circle. Russian media reports stated that both sides \u201cexchanged in-depth views and reached broad consensus on China-Russia relations and a series of major issues concerning international security and strategic stability\u201d. Cooperation in space and nuclear energy was also said to have been on the agenda. The Kremlin website highlighted a telephone conversation between Putin and Yang during which their \u201cdiscussion focused on the further development of Russian-Chinese relations of comprehensive partnership and strategic interaction\u201d and \u201calso touched upon several pressing issues on the international agenda\u201d. No other details have been made publicly available on Yang\u2019s visit. Military Ties Russia was a major arms supplier to China; however, China\u2019s share of Russian arms exports has declined from 47.7 % of total sales in 2006 to 13.7% in 2018, according to a recent study by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute based in Singapore. The rapid growth of China\u2019s defence sector has led to less reliance on Russia. Nevertheless, China\u2019s purchase of Russia\u2019s advanced SU-35 fighter jets and S-400 air defence systems, and reported Russian assistance with new missile launch detection technology, show that Russia is still an important weapons source. China has also participated in annual large-scale Russian military exercises, joint bomber patrols over the Sea of Japan, and joint naval exercises. These exercises reflect a lessening of mutual suspicions on the part of both countries\u2019 military and political leadership. IT and Space Cooperation In the face of Western opposition, Huawei found a partner in MTS, Russia\u2019s largest mobile network operator. They signed a deal on 5G technology in 2019 which was finalised after President Xi Jinping and Putin met in Moscow. In April 2021, it was reported that MTS and Huawei had activated 5G networks at 14 iconic locations in Moscow. The partnership was a milestone in the accelerated commercialisation of 5G in Russia. Both countries are also reportedly cooperating in developing alternative global navigation satellite systems, which have both commercial and military applications. In March 2021, both countries signed a memorandum of understanding on cooperation in the construction of an international lunar research station. A senior Russian official of Roskosmos space agency was reported as saying that in future, both countries would design technical procedures for their respective spacecraft to allow integration in future space missions. Bilateral Trade Overall, bilateral trade is the one area both presidents have been touting as successes in strengthening relations. Trade between the two countries totaled almost US$108 billion in 2020. However, energy accounts for over 70% of Russian exports to China. The Yamal LNG project, in the Russian Arctic, is a major Chinese investment, totaling almost 30%; China also acquired a 10% stake in the Arctic LNG 2 project. Russia is now a major supplier of gas; the Power of Siberia natural gas pipeline was officially opened by both presidents via teleconference in December 2019. Apart from gas, nuclear energy plays an important role in bilateral trade. In May 2021, both presidents witnessed via video link the groundbreaking ceremony of four advanced nuclear reactors powered by Russia's third-generation nuclear technology. These projects represent the biggest bilateral nuclear energy cooperation project to date. Both countries have set US$200 billion as a target for expansion in bilateral trade by 2024. Whether this goal can be reached and whether Russia\u2019s major exports to China would remain energy-based, remains to be seen. Diversification in Russia\u2019s exports to China is, however, a real challenge. In other words, Russia might become a raw materials and energy appendage of China, a fear widely expressed in the 1990s of Russia\u2019s then relationship with the West. Assessing Russia-China Relations Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stressed in March during a visit to China that relations between the two countries were the \"best in history\u201d. Yet, they are not without challenges. Both countries had expressed an interest in building a high-speed rail link between Moscow and Kazan in 2015, as part of China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). However, it was reportedly postponed in 2020, due to the high cost involved ($23 billion). While China is an important purchaser of its military weapons, Russian concern about China in this area was made clear by a report in December 2019 which stated that Rostec had publicly accused China of illegally copying a broad spectrum of Russian military technologies over the course of nearly two decades. (Rostec is a state conglomerate that specialises on investing in strategically important companies, mainly in the defence and high-tech industries). China is already a major arms supplier and a competitor for Russia. Their oft-declared close links has not dissipated Russia\u2019s wariness of China\u2019s increased economic and other interests in the Arctic. Russia is an Arctic military power in its own right and due to geographical proximity, \u201cRussia needs the Arctic incomparably more than the rest of the world,\u201d according to a recent study of Russian Arctic policy by Russian experts. The study also calls for Russian-Chinese cooperation in the region to be complemented with other partners like Japan, South Korea, India, and Southeast Asia. New Power Equilibrium? Apart from political reasons and its own interest in retaining its strategic independence vis-\u00e0-vis the US and China, Russia has strong economic reasons to remain on good terms with the West, especially the European Union. While China is currently Russia\u2019s largest trade partner, its trade with the EU as a whole in 2020 amounted to 174.3 billion euros; 36.5% of Russia\u2019s imports came from the EU and 38% of its exports went to the EU. While trade with the US is small (about $21 billion in 2020, according to US statistics), Russia\u2019s main agenda with the US was and remains strategic arms control, being one of two of the world\u2019s leading nuclear powers. Russia has lately signalled its interest in a better relationship with the West. The forthcoming Russia-US Summit between Putin and Biden is not expected to \u201cfind common ground on the issues causing deep divisions,\u201d in the words of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov recently. In the same breath, he noted that \u201cit would be also wrong to play down the importance of this meeting\u201d. Earlier in May, Lavrov told a conference that \u201cWe are ready to be friends with the West,\u201d emphasising however that \u201conly if it comes with a sense of our own dignity\u201d. These signals show that Moscow is not averse to giving its growing relationship with Beijing some pause by holding the Putin-Biden Summit. Putin would like to show his people and China that the US still treats Russia as an equal. This is also a clear reminder to China that Russia cannot be taken for granted. What Putin is doing essentially is a balancing game. Whether it would lead to a new power equilibrium between Russia, China and the US, remains to be seen."

    "title": "Smart Nation: Privacy Protection and Public Trust",
    "author(s)": "By Teo Yi-Ling and Manoj Harjani",
    "date": "No. 018 \u2013 2 February 2021",
    "content": "IN THE course of implementing TraceTogether \u0336 a digital system to facilitate contact tracing efforts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic \u2500 assurance had been given at the highest levels that individual privacy would be respected. Accusations have, however, been levelled at the government of breaking trust and leveraging technology for political control. Legitimate questions have been asked about when it knew that existing Criminal Procedure Code provisions covered use of TraceTogether data, and why disclosure of this fact was not made upfront. Privacy lacks a clear definition in the Singapore context \u2013 does it refer to privacy of the person, their data, or both? There is no black-letter law in Singapore enshrining privacy of the person \u2013 it is not a constitutionally-guaranteed right. Where the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) is concerned, it only provides for the obligations of businesses in protecting customers\u2019 personal data and does not cover government use of personal data. What impact will this controversy have on public attitudes towards adopting future data-driven Smart Nation initiatives? Respecting Privacy The Singapore government\u2019s inexorable march towards a Smart Nation has thus far been presented as a fait accompli. However, there is now a clear and urgent need to reconsider the current approach, particularly given broader shifts that have been unfolding in the public trust environment in Singapore. Automation and digitalisation have provided considerable convenience at work and in daily life. The trade-off for accessing this convenience is providing personal data and private information. Yet confidentiality and privacy cannot be guaranteed as companies and government agencies can tap into data repositories for all kinds of reasons. How might individuals safely navigate this trade-off in a digital existence without losing what they hold dear and personal, and who can they trust to guide them? The Singapore government has previously acknowledged the negative impact of distrust upon Smart Nation efforts. Before pressing on with more Smart Nation rollouts, it is then crucial to strengthen public trust by addressing two immediate matters. The first is creating a clear definition of privacy. The second is publicly clarifying the government\u2019s guiding principles regarding decision-making involving personal data. These will allow the public to understand what is at stake. How the government responds to the TraceTogether controversy will determine whether Singapore can manage the growing global concern regarding smart city endeavours \u2013 erosion of personal privacy and liberty in the name of public safety and efficient service delivery. Coherency, Transparency and Accountability The PDPA\u2019s current focus is on how businesses manage personal data \u2013 there seems to be an assumption that if businesses are regulated, citizens\u2019 interests will be protected by proxy. This is risky given continuing data breaches and growing concern about misaligned incentives for Internet companies that profit directly from personal data. Exacerbating the situation further is the government\u2019s exemption from the PDPA despite it being the most significant user of data in Singapore and occasional lapses in data security management by government agencies. An uncomfortable precedent appears to have been set regarding repurposing data gathered ostensibly in the public interest for law enforcement and regulating individual behaviour. To be sure, the issue is far less about data being accessed by law enforcement agencies, than it is about the relative ease with which the original limits on the data\u2019s use were lifted. Given the breadth of the multi-agency taskforce leading Singapore\u2019s pandemic response, it is not easy for some citizens to accept the government\u2019s explanation that it did not anticipate potential use of TraceTogether data for investigative purposes, and why it did not proactively address this publicly upon realisation. Improving Governance of Data-related Issues Nevertheless, there is a clear imperative emerging from this controversy to improve governance of data-related issues. The Government Data Strategy formulated in 2018 already lays out a sound approach for the public sector to better leverage data; the Public Sector Data Security Review in 2019 complemented this with recommendations to improve data security. What is missing, however, is clarity on accountability for use of data by the government beyond ensuring its security. To address this, the government should consider developing a broader framework for data governance and implement it in a transparent manner so the public is aware of the \u201cwho, what, when, where, why and how\u201d when it comes to their personal data. This way, the government will by design be able to account for how it collects and uses data \u2013 ideally in a manner that the public can digest at every touchpoint where their personal data comes into play. Beyond data, the government will also need to address a current lack of regulations governing its development and adoption of digital technologies in an ethical manner and in the public interest. To this end, the government should consider creating an ombudsman for ethical development and deployment of technology, with a complementary audit process subject to transparency in the public domain. Road Ahead: Need for National Conversation On the broader issues of privacy regulation and rights, change may be on the horizon. In December 2020, the Law Reform Committee issued a report proposing a new law addressing insufficiencies and incoherencies in the current patchwork of privacy legislation. To what extent this proposed law impacts Singapore\u2019s Smart Nation agenda is yet to be seen, but it is being surfaced at a time when the national discourse on privacy is sharpening. This is a critical opportunity for a meaningful and open public conversation. Singapore has busied itself with the legislative infrastructure to speed up the drive towards Smart Nation-hood, but has spent less effort on the contentious issue of how individual rights will be affected by digitalisation, and what the public really wants \u2013 or needs \u2013 out of the government\u2019s adoption of technology. As we progress towards becoming a Smart Nation, we must now reckon with a renegotiation of the social contract and legitimate expectations on both sides \u2013 the more digitally transformed our lives become, the more we must remember our humanity, values, and vulnerabilities."

    "title": "Global Health Security: COVID-19 & Its Impacts Small States and Pandemic: Qatar\u2019s Approach",
    "author(s)": "By Deep Datta Ray",
    "date": "No. 134 \u2013 30 June 2020",
    "content": "AT THE Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs Town Hall on 22 June 2020, Minister Dr Vivian Balakrishnan spoke of operating in the new normal engendered by the COVID- 19 pandemic. Underscoring this is a fundamental concern: managing and converting challenges into opportunities for small states. Doing so in a post-pandemic and post-globalisation world is fraught with uncertainty. It may be lessened by borrowing Dr Balakrishnan\u2019s framework to assess how another small state, Qatar, handles its challenges. Innovation in the New Normal The Singapore foreign minister notes that COVID-19 accelerates pre-existing global threats, including climate change, nuclear proliferation and cyber attacks. The pandemic exacerbates inequality, debt, resistance to globalisation, and divergences between technology and supply chains. Additionally, work-from-home is work-from- anywhere, which means that regardless of location, everyone competes. The pandemic is also sharpening geopolitics. US-China rivalry is intensifying. The US is questioning its commitment to external engagement and global forums, but China is stepping up globally. There are regional tensions too, and as India and China illustrate, these can flare up. Qatar\u2019s opportunity creation in the new normal is in fintech, aviation and digitisation. Innovation is however incipient, lacks first-mover advantage, costly, and might be insufficient in managing blue-collar worker\u2019s mistreatment. Qatar Mobile Payments System was launched in April. Its electronic wallet taps the non-banking sector and so boosts local SMEs\u2019 clientele. The System is the kernel for a fintech industry and seeks US investment to make Qatar a hub. There will however be competition from the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, and others, who already have similar systems and plans in place. Qatar Airways\u2019 loss-making strategy to gain market share meant operations were not curtailed but flights were added and ticketing made very flexible. Ranked 19th in 2019 Qatar Airways is now the top passenger carrier \u2500 at a cost. Working capital has been expended, a bailout is almost certain, and at least 20 percent of the fleet will be permanently grounded. Education\u2019s digitisation \u2013 using Microsoft Teams and YouTube \u2013 attunes Qatari transnational education has been students significantly worsened by the pandemic as there is scant student interest in higher education institutions, even regionally. to global competition. However, Digitisation, Multilateralism and Cyber Security Supply chains are being digitised to maintain globalisation. \u2018Better Connections\u2019 gives blue-collar workers computers and training to enhance contact with family and engage in online commerce. It is to be seen if this will stop blue-collar workers fleeing mismanagement in the wake of COVID-19, or entice them to return. At least 34 blue- collar workers have died. Moreover, perceptions have taken a hit as they continue to protest poor conditions, non-payment of salaries, and having to beg on the streets to stave off starvation. The condition of workers in the wake of the pandemic has also undermined climate change innovation. Qatar pledged a carbon-neutral FIFA World Cup 2022 but green architecture plans for naturally air-cooled buildings have been delayed by infections and deaths amongst workers. Doha prefers a mix of multilateral organisations, the rule of law, and NGOs to manage concerns, like Singapore\u2019s, in the world after the threat of COVID-19 recedes. Multilateralism is preferred in nuclear matters. Doha commended the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on developing protocols for nuclear containment of COVID-19 infection and ensuring reactor safety during the pandemic. Qatar also asked the IAEA to address concerns about the UAE\u2019s Barakah nuclear plant and expects its help in drafting a regional nuclear security framework. In the first quarter of 2020 Qatar faced at least 2,033 COVID-19 related cyber attacks. In May, Qatar\u2019s UN ambassador committed to curtailing cyber crime via the world body and called for an international instrument for cyber security. Pre-pandemic, Qatar had condemned unilateral policing in tackling the rapid rise in abuse and misuse of the cyber domain. International cooperation is necessary to establish relevant rules and norms. Responsiveness to NGOs allows Qatar to maintain the rule of law and enhance international perceptions to some degree. Amnesty International reported a weakness in the mandatory COVID-19 tracing app EHTERAZ, and the authorities responded. An employer was banned thanks to Amnesty uncovering mistreatment of around 100 blue-collar workers. The scale of their protests however suggest NGOs can do little to avert maltreatment or perceptions. Post COVID-19: Still Friend to All Enmeshed in Sino-US and regional rivalries, Qatar might well be in a post- globalisation world which has fostered resilience. Doha engages multilaterally, in a rule-bound manner, and most successfully, by making friends across camps. In May, a US official revealed America had asked allies and partners to sever ties with China. Weeks prior to the revelation, but certainly after Washington began pressuring allies, Qatar handed China its largest shipbuilding contract to date. China is Qatar\u2019s third largest trading partner after the Republic of Korea and Japan. Nevertheless, Al Udeid base continues to host some 10,000 US troops and remains the forward base for America\u2019s Central Command. Qatar\u2019s \u2018relationship of necessity\u2019 with Iran arises from shared ownership of the South Pars/North Field gas field. Iran also allows use of its airspace during the blockade following Qatar\u2019s refusal to join the war in Yemen, and this enabled Qatar Airways to continue its flight operations to regional and international destinations. Qatar continues to support Iran in several areas, despite American opposition. The Yemeni conflict has embroiled Qatar since 2017 in diplomatic rupture with its neighbours. Qatar remains open to any initiative by anyone to end the blockade so long as its sovereignty is maintained. Moreover, the blockade has inculcated the resilience necessary to overcome COVID-19 challenges. Food sustainability is indicative. When dairy supplies from neighbours dried, Qatar imported cows and began dairy and meat farming. Achieved at great cost, it continues to operate at a loss. The Gulf Cooperation Council\u2019s (GCC) inability to mediate an end to the blockade does not turn Doha away from it. Indeed, Qatar remains intent on participating in GCC meetings, especially those on jointly fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. The commitment to the GCC and regional multilateralism is apparent \u2500 Qatar strongly refutes speculation that it is contemplating renouncing membership. Clearly Qatar\u2019s proactive approach overlaps with Singapore\u2019s concerns. It remains to be seen however if, amongst other factors, workers return, perceptions recover, and the capital intensity of Doha\u2019s measures is plausible in the longue dur\u00e9e of the new normal."

    "title": "IS Entry into Rakhine Conflict: Urgency in Nation-Building",
    "author(s)": "By Jasminder Singh & Muhammad Haziq Jani",
    "date": "No. 005 \u2013 8 January 2021",
    "content": "IS\u2019 EARLY attempts to insert itself into the communal conflict in Rakhine seemed to have manifested, at best, in tenuous support for the Rohingya; it referenced the need for jihad in Myanmar. In June 2014, when self-proclaimed caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi announced the so-called Islamic State (IS) in his speech that also called for jihad in Myanmar, he promised revenge for atrocities committed against Muslims. In 2016, the amir of IS affiliate in Bangladesh (or IS Bengal) Abu Ibrahim al-Hanif reiterated the call for jihad, viewing Bangladesh as a stepping stone to Myanmar. Other pro-IS groups in Bangladesh also called for jihad in Myanmar to support the Rohingya, including key IS affiliate Neo-Jamaatul Mujahidin Bangladesh. Rise of ARSA Such calls to jihad in Myanmar were also sounded by pro-IS groups in Pakistan and India, such as the Lashkar-e-Toiba and Indian Mujahidin, as well as IS supporters in Southeast Asia. Unlike other pockets of IS\u2019 global network, these calls were not immediately followed up by the formation of an area-specific unit. Despite the capabilities of IS\u2019 network in South and Southeast Asia, IS\u2019 footprints in Myanmar following these calls for jihad were negligible. During this period, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) was the focal point of militancy in the long-standing Rohingya conflict. Led by Ataullah Abu Ammar Jununi, ARSA was formed after the 2012 Rakhine State riots and first made itself known as Harakah al-Yaqin (Faith Movement). The group reportedly received funding and training from Al-Qaeda-linked networks in Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Afghanistan. ARSA conducted its first attacks on Myanmar border posts along the Bangladesh border in October 2016; it continued to target Myanmar security forces in a series of reprisals for the Myanmar military\u2019s \u201cclearance operations\u201d, which resulted in the ongoing Rohingya refugee crisis. ARSA\u2019s raids on Myanmar\u2019s security forces (police and military) had largely been asymmetrical, suffering heavy losses in order to obtain weapons and ammunition. International attention focused on the Myanmar army\u2019s reported human rights abuses in its treatment of the uninvolved Rohingya population. To position itself better in the conflict, ARSA insists that it is \u201cdefending\u201d the Rohingya population and that it is a secular group as opposed to an Islamist one linked to a transnational terrorism network. It abandoned its Arabic name for ARSA to this effect. New Group: Katibah al-Mahdi of Arakan In early November 2020, a new jihadist group in Rakhine, Katibah al-Mahdi fi Bilad al- Arakan (Brigade of al-Mahdi in the Arakan State) represented by its spokesperson Abu Lut al-Muhajir, made bai\u2019ah (oath of allegiance) to IS leader Abu Ibrahim al- Hashimi al-Qurashi. The group\u2019s name referenced al-Mahdi, an eschatological, prophesised saviour of Muslims that IS once claimed to be in the service of. Several possibilities could be surmised from this development. First, given that the oath was published in IS\u2019 mouthpiece for the Indian subcontinent, Sawt al-Hind (\u201cThe Voice of Hind\u201d), Katibah al-Mahdi could potentially seek to coordinate its activities with groups operating in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Second, with \u201cal-Muhajir\u201d (the Emigrant) appended to his name, Katibah al-Mahdi's leader and members could be emigres from the Middle East or other parts of South Asia or Rohingya who had travelled to other parts of South Asia for training and are now returning. It is also possible that Abu Lut himself, and perhaps some other members of the group, could be non-Rohingya IS supporters from India, Sri Lanka or Bangladesh. Broader Shift in Ideology In this latter scenario, the Rakhine conflict could serve as a training ground or outlet for IS supporters and add to IS\u2019 \u201charvest\u201d, a term it uses to measure the operations conducted by its fighters and supporters globally. Third, the use of the term katibah (military unit or brigade) suggests that the group likely comprised a large number of fighters and could be more organised. This would follow the trend of similarly named IS units either based in or outside Syria such as Katibah al-Bittar al-Libi, Nusantara, Macina, Yarmouk, Aqsa and Khaybar. The timing of the Katibah al-Mahdi's bai\u2019ah could also point to a few issues. Understandably, a new unit in Myanmar would be in line with IS Central\u2019s desire to expand its global footprint having lost its territories in Iraq and Syria. However, it could also explain a broader shift in the ideology of Rohingya militants away from ethno-nationalism, given that ARSA\u2019s efforts had only resulted in horrific reprisals from the Myanmar army and that the international community could not resolve the humanitarian crisis. Addressing Root Causes: Nation-Building Notwithstanding the current dearth of information about the newly emerged IS affiliate, the security implications of the emergence of Katibah al-Mahdi are potentially significant not just for Myanmar but both South and Southeast Asia. The use of the term \u2018Katibah\u2019 suggests a commitment to military operations to achieve its goals. At a time of the COVID-19 pandemic and where national resources are focused on overcoming the health and related economic crisis, the rise of groups such as Katibah al-Mahdi clearly poses a greater challenge for Myanmar. It is also a signal that the military or violent option could be the greater focus, either by Rohingya or in the name of the Rohingya for what this minority had endured in Myanmar since 2012. This will up the ante and more violence may be expected in the largely Buddhist- Bamar conflict with the Muslim Rohingya, with their attendant implications for regional security. COVID-19: New Dimension to Conflict In a COVID-19 centric environment, this will add a new dimension of conflict. The competition among transnational groups such as Al Qaeda and IS is also likely to be intensified as both try to carve out an area of control and claim a territory to champion, not just Rohingya-related causes but also to inspire other regional militant groups in the COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 situation. The surfacing of Katibah al-Mahdi may also worsen relations between Muslims and non-Muslims, not just in Myanmar but also in Bangladesh, India, and possibly Southeast Asia. Aside from military targets, the IS affiliate could potentially attack local Buddhists and Hindus. If this happens, it would worsen interfaith relations, particularly among communities already tensed by real and perceived fears of Islamophobia and faith-based nationalism. A long-term solution is to address the root causes of the oppression of the Rohingya in Myanmar by looking beyond the security lens to giving support for nation-building."

    "title": "War as a Service: Stop Overhyping Technology",
    "author(s)": "By Heiko Borchert, Torben Sch\u00fctz and Joseph Verbovszky",
    "date": "No. 123 \u2013 13 August 2021",
    "content": "THE CURRENT debate about the role of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in conflicts like Ukraine, Syria, Libya, and Nagorno-Karabakh illustrates the prevailing techno- fetishisation that dominates the defence innovation discourse. As we have argued in Beware the Hype, the overemphasis on UAV leads to a distorted perception of warfighting reality. Correcting this misperception is important. The military innovation literature makes it amply clear that technology needs to be seen in a much broader context that also considers cultural, conceptual, and organisational aspects. Therefore, no military asset is decisive on its own. Rather, all assets need to be integrated into a complex military ecosystem that reflects this broader context. What WaaS Is All About Instead of focusing on single aspects, more attention needs to be devoted to the way complex military ecosystems are delivered. War as a Service (WaaS) is a striking feature of the four conflicts mentioned above that has the potential to change force transformation and the use of military power. So far, both aspects have been overlooked. WaaS is a comprehensive politico-military concept to transfer military power in a government-to-government framework. This government-centric focus potentially \"renationalises\" the monopoly of power and sets WaaS apart from outsourcing military power to non-state actors or unloading the burden of warfighting onto partners. Unlike these concepts, WaaS describes the deep, strategically driven, and mission- tailored integration of foreign expertise, units, and assets into the partner's armed forces. Thus, WaaS is neither about outsourcing nor delegating warfighting power, but about embedding and potentially amalgamating military capabilities of strategic partners. Russia's support of Syria and Field Marshal Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) and Turkey's support of Azerbaijan and the Government of National Accord (GNA) in Libya are exemplary WaaS use cases. Turkey's WaaS offering included Turkish UAVs optimised for the use with Turkish missiles and electronic warfare payloads; UAV missions conducted by Turkish operation centres; close synchronisation of UAV missions with local force elements; third-party training prior to the conflict; operational planning by Turkish commanders; on-the-ground presence with Turkish troop elements and commanders/advisors as well as the use of Turkish battlefield engineers. It is this turn-key approach that makes WaaS so attractive for suppliers and recipients. Recipients get instant access to the comprehensive mix of assets, concepts, tactics, and operational advice needed for battlefield success. Suppliers keep the force package ecosystem under full military and political control by using their own assets on behalf of the recipient. Why WaaS Matters: Cocooning Bilateral Relations In principle, WaaS is a tried and tested approach to support allies that has been in use at least since the early modern era. The need to develop new warfighting concepts in response to changing strategic challenges, the growing importance of cutting-edge technologies, and the adaptation of commercial applications for warfighting, however, give WaaS a new meaning. As discussed, deep integration is the key to understanding the strategic relevance of WaaS. Three aspects are particularly relevant: First, WaaS offers a short cut to force transformation by insourcing dedicated force packages provided by an ally willing to lend military power to partners. Nagorno- Karabakh serves as a telling example. While Armenia grossly neglected force adaptation, Azerbaijan gradually stepped up force modernisation. Indigenous improvements were leveraged with Turkey's WaaS offering thus boosting Baku's military power in a limited military operation. Second, WaaS could change the character of bilateral relations because it is about more than weapons supply. By addressing tactics, providing operational support, and offering training, WaaS can stimulate strategic harmonisation between supplier and recipient in parallel with force transformation as illustrated by the increasingly strong Azerbaijani-Turkish bonds. This can accelerate the cocooning of bilateral relations vis- \u00e0-vis outside interference. Third, to make maximum use of the politico-military leeway offered by WaaS, the WaaS supplier's defence industrial maturity is essential. A WaaS supplier that depends less on foreign products and technologies to produce the assets on offer can better mitigate the risk of third-party export bans that undermine the security of supply and thus protect bilateral relations. This limits the number of potential WaaS suppliers but might also incentivise states to focus even more on a tightly controlled national supply chain. WaaS: Not a One-Size-Fits-All-Solution Despite the concept's attractiveness, our comparative analysis suggests that successful WaaS application depends on several factors: First, WaaS rests upon a complex of power relations between partners resulting in mutually beneficial supply and demand. This requires highly congruent ambitions as the recipient gives the supplier a free hand by accepting the turn-key solution. The supplier, in turn, must be willing to offer the full package, take the risk of getting involved in the conflict, and feel at ease with \"white labelling\" its contribution. Second, conflict characteristics matter. If only one warring party has access to WaaS- like support the power balance becomes highly asymmetric as seen in Nagorno- Karabakh. In this regard, supplied WaaS portfolios play a key role. Third, the behaviour of the WaaS recipient is decisive. In Libya, Field Marshal Haftar probably overplayed his cards as he relied on Egypt and the United Arab Emirates as supporters while also seeking the assistance of the Wagner group. Not only did Cairo and Abu Dhabi part ways throughout the conflict. Haftar's forces also lacked the necessary capability to integrate outside support thus leaving him with a patchwork of loosely coordinated force elements rather than integrated force packages. Finally, the WaaS recipient's defence industrial maturity matters, too. Poland's decision to buy 24 armed Bayraktar TB2 UAV in May 2021 met local critique, as national UAV manufacturers would have reportedly been able to deliver comparable solutions. Robust defence industrial capacities and diverging defence industrial interests between local players and foreign WaaS suppliers can render WaaS integration much more difficult and limits its potential to improve the recipient's military capabilities. Way Forward The overfocus of today's defence discourse on technology might become obsolete, if WaaS suppliers combine concepts, operational experience, and comprehensive battlefield support with leading technologies to offer fully integrated force packages. That's why defence analysts must pay more attention to WaaS and start asking pertinent questions: Is WaaS a push or rather a pull market? Which nations are ready to supply WaaS or ask for WaaS support? How will the military establishment of WaaS recipients respond to the outside force elements that should be integrated? What is the impact on civil- military relations in the recipient nation? And finally, is it easier to regulate a state offering WaaS than a private military company?"

    "title": "The Brits Are Coming: Can They Sustain It?",
    "author(s)": "By Geoffrey Till",
    "date": "No. 075 \u2013 4 May 2021",
    "content": "FOR SEVERAL years, the British government has been making clear their intention to tilt towards the Indo-Pacific region as part of the new 'Global Britain' brand in the wake of Brexit. This intention has now been underlined by a detailed official announcement from the ministry of defence in London that a carrier task force centred on HMS Queen Elizabeth will shortly be despatched for a visit to the region. The carrier strike group will comprise, among others, two Type 45 Air Defence destroyers, two Type 23 anti-submarine frigates, and two Royal Fleet Auxiliary support vessels. It is understood that an Astute class nuclear propelled submarine will accompany the strike group. Non-British participants in the group include the Dutch frigate HMNLS Evertsen and the American destroyer USS The Sullivans, together with a contingent of ten US Marine Corps F35B aircraft. An Indo-Pacific Presence Post-Brexit? The plan is for the strike group to visit more than 40 countries, including India, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore. Highlights are expected to be exercises in the Mediterranean with the French carrier Charles de Gaulle. This is intended to convey Britain's continuing interest in the Mediterranean and the Gulf, and a determination to maintain close defence links with mainland Europe despite Brexit and its Pacific tilt. Another highlight will be heavy engagement with India, which is likewise re- invigorating and expanding its carrier forces. There is developing interest in some degree of British association with the Quad group of countries and a very keen British desire for a free trade deal between the two countries, in the wake of its departure from the European Union. In Southeast Asia the group will participate in the Exercise Bersama Lima with Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Singapore to mark the 50th anniversary of the Five Powers Defence Arrangement (FPDA). The group will sail through the South China Sea on its way to North East Asia for visits to South Korea and Japan. The group is not apparently intending to sail through the Taiwan strait, to the disappointment of some. The fact that both Japan and South Korea are in the early stages of developing carrier capabilities will guarantee strong professional interest in the visits. Moreover, Japan with its new amphibious forces is very interested in the well-regarded UK style of amphibious operation, as was evident from Tokyo's interest in the visit of HMS Albion a couple of years ago. In the course of the deployment the group is likely to disaggregate so that individual units can operate individual deployments in support of the overall mission. Australia with its acquisition of a frigate design based on the new British Type 26 frigate is likely to be a major part of such programmes, and New Zealand too. Pan-European FONOPs? Other European nations have also signalled much the same intent, if not necessarily the same scale. The French have always seen themselves as significant players in the Indo-Pacific as have the Dutch who will be a formal part of the carrier strike group. Germany and Italy have also confirmed their intention to send naval assets to the area. It would be surprising if effort were not made to exploit opportunities for further European defence cooperation out-of-area. The British government has endeavoured to show that this is not intended as an anti- China cruise, but with its stated aim of exercising, and so confirming, the principle of freedom of navigation; the deployment is unlikely to be welcome in Beijing. British criticism of Beijing's actions in Hong Kong and the recent House of Commons vote accusing China of 'genocide' in Xinjiang will not help. Nonetheless, the British wish to maintain economic links with China and are fully aware of local sensitivities about great power competition and so will seek to avoid undue provocation."

    "title": "The Besieged Capital: Militarisation of Washington DC",
    "author(s)": "By Adam Garfinkle",
    "date": "No. 010 \u2013 19 January 2021",
    "content": "IF VISITORS were to find themselves in Washington, DC right now and took the opportunity to cycle around the Capitol, they would see the entire National Mall area fenced off and under armed guard. That includes all the museums, including the Natural History Museum, the Air & Space Museum, the Native American Museum, the National Museum of African-American History and Culture, and the rest. It includes the Library of Congress, the Supreme Court, the Capitol of course, the House and Senate Office Buildings, and more. The Capitol: Barb-Wired Ten-foot high no-climb, no-tip fences with razor wire, and jersey barriers, are everywhere. Each cross street along Independence Avenue facing toward the Mall and the White House is blocked by police with the aid of either a massive dump truck or a giant Metro bus. No one on foot can enter any building in this area, not even the lobby, without a police or National Guard badge, or some specialty badge such as an Architect of the Capitol badge for those who work, for example, at the Botanical Gardens building. Tanks and armoured personnel carriers are plentiful. The DC National Guard, unique among US National Guard units in that it is always federalised, has flooded in. Guardsmen stand in full riot gear, armed with an array of automatic rifles. Nearest the Capitol they are deployed in groups of two or three about every ten metres. FBI personnel are everywhere, bomb-sniffing dogs in tow. There are DC police, Capitol Police, Park Police, and Secret Service units all over the place. More uniformed and armed military and police personnel are deployed right now in Washington, DC -- more than 20,000 -- than in all the anti-terror deployments involving the US Armed Forces around the world. Like Living in a Baghdad Green Zone My youngest son lives less than a kilometre from the epicentre of the security node. A senator has an apartment in the same building, as do several other elected and other officials. Private and DC police security and surveillance of that and many dozens of similar buildings are intense. Police stopped my son\u2019s car as he made his way to work a few days ago; the officers were deeply curious about what he was doing with a bolt cutter. (He does hardscaping and landscaping work; bolt-cutters come in handy for that sort of thing. Luckily, he did not bring along his chainsaw.) This is what my hometown looks like in these days before the Inauguration of Joe Biden as the 46th president of the United States on 20 January 2021. Except for the weather, a mild winter, it actually looks and feels a little like the Green Zone in Baghdad. No one here has ever witnessed anything like it. No Inauguration, not even the Pope\u2019s visit in 2015, has seen security like this. What cannot be seen with the naked eye is the fact the United States approaches the Inauguration with an \u201cacting\u201d Secretary of Defence, an \u201cacting-acting\u201d Secretary of Homeland Security in an insurrectional moment, and a soon to be \u201cacting\u201d Secretary of Health and Human Services at a time of maximum pandemic peril. It is not a happy moment for rank-and-file US national security professionals. Overwhelming Force as Deterrent So I am glad for the extraordinary security precautions in the city. As my former boss, Colin L. Powell, likes to say, overwhelming force not only works better as a deterrent than marginally superior force, it can also work as a way to minimise and quickly smother violence if it breaks out anyway. That is what US authorities are doing in Washington right now, and there are signs that some of the groups involved in threatening violence are indeed in the process of being deterred before this major display of force majeure. Social media is replete with warning messages from the seditious far right that the \u201cdeep state\u201d is setting a trap. But of course there is no \u201cdeep state\u201d as imagined in the addled minds of conspiracy- theory mongers -- even if, perchance, some of those warning messages have originated in certain US government agencies. The authorities, and the rest of the sane people in the DC area with them, are fearing the worst, hoping for the best, and expecting something in between. Downsides to Capital\u2019s Militarisation The downsides to the militarisation of the capital city, however, are several. The optic it broadcasts to the nation and to rest of the world, like the optic of much of what has happened since the 3 November election, is very disheartening. One has to wonder if it makes any sense right now for the incoming Biden administration to pursue its plan for a Summit of Democracies anytime soon. Hookers are not persuasive preaching chastity, and the US government cannot be persuasive right now lecturing on democratic probity. Then there is the problem of nails without heads: easy to drive in, difficult to pull out. On 24 March 1986, the Reagan administration ordered attacks on Libyan military assets near the Gulf of Sidra following alleged accumulated evidence of Libyan government involvement in terror attacks in Europe and elsewhere. The attacks were accompanied by a hardening of potential high-symbolic terrorist targets in Washington, including along Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House, and extending down the block towards New York Avenue in front of the Treasury Department. That cordoned-off area eventually became a pedestrian zone, flanked by large concrete barriers. The threat long ago had subsided, but the \u201ctemporary\u201d measures taken in 1986 remain. 6 January: Guerilla Attack More than Terrorism Similarly, transport security procedures enacted after 11 September 2001, like having little old ladies and arthritic old men remove their shoes to go through airport security, remain in force two decades later, even though they are arguably counter-productive. Some say \u201cyou can\u2019t be too careful\u201d, but actually, yes, you can: You can do terrorism\u2019s work for it by being complicit in the undermining of your own social morale, principles and way of life. That said, referring to the groups and individuals involved in the 6 January insurrection at the Capitol as domestic terrorists is, in my view, a bit overwrought. If we stick to the proper definition, terrorism must involve deliberate acts of deadly force designed to shock authorities into reacting counterproductively to them. What happened on 6 January, and may happen again soon, is better described as guerilla theatre spectacle along the lines of the reality-TV mentality, which makes perfect sense considering that Donald Trump, as principal instigator, has been a reality-TV president all along. Killing people was not the aim of the 6 January insurrectionists, but that was then and what is coming may indeed involve deliberate use of deadly force. So no one knows how long what is now described as temporary may need to endure. It is therefore understandable to worry that the security expedients now erected in Washington may outlive their utility but remain in place anyway. Nothing is more permanent than a temporary government programme, after all. Necessary and prudent as it may be for the moment, it is heartbreaking to see Washington in its present straits. It would be soul-shattering for me and many others -- Americans and non-US nationals alike -- if the heartbreak were to become routinised."

    "title": "Global Health Security COVID-19 & Tablighi Jama'at: Religious Movements & the Need for Dialogue",
    "author(s)": "By Farish A. Noor",
    "date": "No. 056 \u2013 31 March 2020",
    "content": "BY NOW alarm has been raised about the numbers of people who have been infected with the COVID-19 virus after attending a large gathering of the Tablighi Jama\u2019at religious movement at the Sri Petaling mosque complex in Malaysia. The gathering, held on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur from 27 February to 1 March 2020, reportedly involved up to 10,000 people from several countries who are devotees of the Tablighi Jama\u2019at movement. The Ministry of Health is tracing the contacts of about 90 Singaporeans who attended the gathering, after two were diagnosed with the coronavirus. Having got themselves infected due to the lack of social distancing, many of the members of this group have returned to their respective countries in the ASEAN region, including Singapore, and there is worry that the virus may spread even further as a result of such large scale human movement. What is the Tablighi Jama\u2019at? Some have asked how and why the members decided to travel to the gathering in the first place, and whether such gatherings can be better controlled or even temporarily stopped as the world dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic. In the case of the Tabligh this is easier said than done, for movement is an essential feature of the group; and if we are to understand why, we would need to understand what the Tabligh. The Tablighi Jama\u2019at is a lay missionary pietist movement among Muslims that emerged in India a century ago. From the outset it has emphasised the need for individual believers to leave their comfort zones, go out into the world to face challenges and hardship, and to renounce all things worldly and materialistic. For seven years I conducted fieldwork with the movement, during which I travelled along with Tabligh members from all over the world - the United Kingdom, France and Germany to India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and to almost every part of Southeast Asia. This need to travel \u2013 which some of the members described as being on a state of permanent pilgrimage \u2013 lies at the core of what the Tabligh is as a movement of faith renewal. When the Tabligh was formed in Northern India in the early part of the 20th century, it regarded the state of Muslims as abysmal. The founders of the movement argued that the faith of many Muslims had been weakened as a result of their attachment to all things worldly (dunia) and materialistic; they believed that one has to renounce worldly attachments to be truly free to believe sincerely. I have met many members from all walks of life who have, upon joining the movement, renounced their worldly attachments and stopped doing things like watching TV, using social media, or given up smoking or drugs. Benign Movement that Moves In many ways the Tabligh was and remains a largely benign movement: It has never sought out confrontation with other faith communities (as it largely confines its activities to other fellow Muslims) and it has never had any political ambitions (for it regards politics as something worldly and therefore a distraction from faith and love for God). Outsiders have sometimes seen them as fatalistic, apolitical and apathetic to the wider needs of society, but the members would argue that one cannot change the world positively unless one has been a better and more faithful individual first. What is special about the Tabligh is that it is a movement that does not have the rigidity of parties, organisations or corporations. Membership is open to all and on a flexible basis: Some join and follow the Tabligh for a weekend a month, some for weeks or months per year, some for life. One thing that they all do is move, in order to meet other members of the faith community and to weaken their bonds to the material world around them. They do not stay in hotels when they travel (for that would be unseemly and too worldly), but choose to stay in mosques and seminaries. This is a mobile movement. In the Indonesian province of West Papua I met a young Tabligh lad who had travelled all the way to Peru \u2013 via Jakarta then to Singapore, then to Japan, then to Los Angeles on to Mexico and finally to Peru and back again. At the large gatherings of the Tabligh I have attended in Pakistan, Southern Thailand (at Yala) and Java (at Temboro) I have met thousands of Tablighs from every part of the world. Way Forward Governments are now faced with the difficult task of educating their respective populations and encouraging them to maintain a healthy social distance from one another while avoiding large gatherings. This poses a problem for movements that conduct pilgrimages in groups, and this applies not only to the Tabligh but also Christians who undertake pilgrimages along the pilgrimage trails of Europe, Hindus who visit temples, and Buddhists who make pilgrimages to shrines. So what is the best way forward with such groups? Firstly, we should remember that the Tabligh has in fact had to self-regulate its activities and movements in the recent past. Two decades ago when Indonesia was in the grip of violent militancy, the Tabligh was infiltrated and used as a vehicle by some radicals who sought to move across Indonesia anonymously. When it was discovered that terrorists had used the movement as a means to get to places like Bali, the Tabligh responded by checking on its members and ensuring that their movement would not become the vector for violence in the country. As the Tabligh is a movement of faith and cares about its members\u2019 welfare, it should be made clear to them that social responsibility is also an important value in religion. Muslim history has many examples of how Muslim rulers have imposed controls on movement in times of epidemics, and Muslim scholars have always laid great emphasis on the concept of collective social wellbeing. So rather than scape-goating or victim-blaming the Tablighi movement and its members, a better approach would be to engage them constructively while opening opportunities for them to demonstrate social responsibility. What applies to the Tabligh also applies to all itinerant movements and pilgrimage groups that likewise move from one place to another. By not singling out the Tabligh as a unique problem we avoid the mistake of adding stigma to crisis; by engaging them positively, such movements can actually play an important role in containing this virus pandemic. The underlying message ought to be that social welfare and caring for the greater good of society are also components of faith, and they are not incompatible."

    "title": "ISIS in the Maldives?",
    "author(s)": "By Raffaello Pantucci and Mohammed Sinan Siyech",
    "date": "No. 062 \u2013 3 April 2020",
    "content": "THE STABBING of three tourists recently in the Maldives has raised the prospect of terrorism in the popular tourist destination. The style of the attack, the subsequent video aping ISIS\u2019 style, and the broader backdrop against which it comes, point to being inspired by the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. The attacks were reported as an isolated incident, though media has suggested authorities might be re-opening an earlier investigation into the stabbing of a Turkish tourist in December. The video emulating ISIS style and tone threatened more attacks, though the group itself has been quiet about the attack so far. Long-time Coming? The attack has been a long time coming. With roughly 250 fighters, and about 1400 alleged radicalised individuals, out of a population of 350,000, the Maldives has amongst the highest per capita instances of foreign terrorist fighters around the world. For some time, there has been fear that an exodus of fighters from the Maldives might return home bringing terrorist violence with them. There is a history of foreign militant fighters from the Maldives going back to the war in Afghanistan. There have been killings of journalists and bloggers on the islands that have been blamed on violent Islamist groups, though questions have been raised around motivations. The last major incident was an attempted bombing in 2007 in Male which injured a dozen tourists. The networks involved then were also present in supporting ISIS. Moreover, A couple of weeks after the stabbing incident, authorities raided properties in Naifaru island of Lhaviyani Atoll claiming to have disrupted a bomb-making plot. No charges were pressed. Identifying Trends There are a few indicators which bear attention. First, there have been incidents in the past few years where ISIS-linked or inspired attackers have launched attacks against visiting foreigners: Tunisia (2015), Tajikistan (2018) and Sri Lanka (2019) are prominent examples. The different sorts of attacks and the nature of the links to ISIS all show how tourists present themselves as easy targets for ISIS adherents (either inspired or directed). In each of those cases, local tensions \u2013 including inequality, anger at government and a sense of injustice \u2013 translated into violence against foreigners. Striking visiting foreigners assuages some of this anger, brings international attention to the situation, and undermines local authorities. All of which makes it an easy fit into the ISIS playbook. Second, there are existing violent operators in the Maldives like drug smugglers and other criminal gangs. There has been evidence of such individuals being specifically recruited into ISIS networks. ISIS narrative offers itself as a source of redemption for previous criminals. Their propensity for violence and access to criminal networks makes these recruits convenient assets within extremist networks. Third, there is a problem of fundamentalism on the margins of society. During former president Abdul Gayoom\u2019s rule (1978\u20132008), many scholars such as Muhammad Ibrahim who did not toe the official line were exiled to islands where they continued preaching their exclusivist messages. Over time, his influence has spread across Maldivian society with his students inspiring attacks such as the above mentioned 2007 bombing and having linkages to ISIS. Closing the Maldivian Pandora\u2019s Box Currently, it is unclear as to the degree to which local authorities have the capability or experience to manage either violent networks at home or those that might return from Syria/Iraq or Afghanistan. For instance, there are links and communications between those abroad and Maldivians back home via encrypted platforms, but there has been little coverage of rehabilitation or other programmes to engage returnees. Understanding the connectivity, the flows home and how to effectively manage such individuals is going to be a crucial task for the authorities. The fact that not much support for this attack has been forthcoming is confusing; but it might reflect earlier divisions amongst the Maldivian radical community who were cleaved in two when ISIS broke from Jabhat al Nusra in the early days of the Syrian civil war. It might also simply reflect ISIS\u2019 general state of chaos at the moment. Key Question The key question at this stage is whether the government has indeed been able to roll up the entirety of this network. Once the profiles are made public, it will be important to note whether any are returnees or the extent of their links to terrorist groups or networks. While the West has not suffered many attacks involving returnees, there have been lethal attacks in Southeast Asian countries involving battle hardened individuals. This escalates the risk profile in the Maldives. The government has not been complacent so far about the potential danger. They have been identifying extremist preachers and raising threat levels across the nation while also engaging in religious counter messaging. However, despite arrests, they have not been able to prosecute returnees or address root causes such as corruption and lack of employment for youth. Given their relative inexperience in managing such threats, it will be important to cooperate with international partners. The country has formulated a national action plan on preventing violent extremism with international support; it will be important to implement any work that flows from it. Beyond this, it will be important to see whether terrorist or extremist networks gain access to better weaponry. Another indicator will be whether ISIS or Al Qaeda- affiliated groups start to raise the profile of the Maldives as a potential target in South Asia. Given that ISIS continues to face pressure on the battlefield, a major attack on a soft target like the Maldives, whether inspired or directed by the group, would provide a useful ideological boost."

    "title": "G7\u2019s \u2018Build Back Better World\u2019: Rival to China\u2019s BRI?",
    "author(s)": "By Pradumna B Rana",
    "date": "No. 109 \u2013 14 July 2021",
    "content": "ON 12 JUNE 2021 the G7 Leaders launched a global infrastructure initiative labelled the \u201cBuild Back Better World (B3W). According to the US government fact sheet issued on the occasion, the B3W will be \u201ca values-based, high standard, and transparent infrastructure partnership led by the major democracies\u201d to \u201ccollectively catalyse hundreds of billions of dollars of infrastructure investment for low and middle-income countries\u201d. Through the B3W, the G7 and other like-minded partners are to \u201ccoordinate in mobilising private-sector capital in four areas of focus \u2013 climate, health and health security, digital technology, and gender equity and equality\u201d. Additional details of the B3W including the level of funding that developing countries could expect to receive are, however, not yet known. Because of the ongoing heightened US-China competition and confrontation, analysts have interpreted the B3W as a rival counter- initiative to China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Progress of BRI: Silk Road Offshoots? The BRI was launched in 2013 as China\u2019s foreign and economic policy initiative to achieve improved connectivity, regional cooperation, and economic development on a transcontinental scale. It presently involves China\u2019s partnership with over 140 countries and international organizations. According to the Refinitiv database, in mid-2019, the BRI comprised some 2631 projects valued at US$3.7 trillion. In the aftermath of the pandemic, as borders closed and lockdowns were imposed, the number of BRI projects started to gradually fall. In June last year, China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that 30-40% of BRI projects had been \u201csomewhat affected\u201d by the pandemic, while another 20% had been \u201cseriously affected\u201d. Restrictions on the flow of Chinese workers and construction supplies were cited as the major reasons for project suspensions or slowdowns in, among others, Pakistan, Cambodia, and Indonesia. There were some speculations about the sustainability of the BRI. But rumours of its demise have proven to be exaggerated. China is gradually moving into new priority areas of sustainable and inclusive growth (Green Silk Road), medical aid and cooperation (Health Silk Road) and telecom and digital infrastructure (Digital Silk Road). B3W and BRI As Rivals If B3W is to be a rival to the BRI, as most expect, it will face several important challenges: \u2022 First, not all of the US\u2019 allies are enthusiastic about the B3W. While the UK continues to rally behind the US, challenges emerge from the European Union and Germany where China is seen as a vital trading and investment partner. Italy\u2019s simultaneous participation in the G7 and the BRI also complicates universal support for the B3W. \u2022 Second, most B3W investments are to come from the private sector which will seek profits from infrastructure projects. It will also be difficult for these investment projects to compete with state-sponsored and supported BRI loans and investments. \u2022 Third, China\u2019s foreign exchange reserves stands at about $3.2 trillion and part of the reason it is investing in BRI projects is to seek higher returns rather than simply hold low-yielding US Treasuries. The G7 countries are not in such a situation. \u2022 Fourth, China has relative comparative advantage in building physical infrastructure, not the G7 countries. Overall infrastructure development and project management skills including cost controls are better in China than in the G7 countries. Construction workers and materials are also cheaper. China has some of the best infrastructure in the world including the fastest train and the longest sea-bridge. The US Interstate Highway System with a total of 77,960 km took 36 years to complete. China completed its National Trunk Highway System which is almost twice as long in 29 years. B3W and BRI as Complements B3W can also complement the BRI in several ways: \u2022 First: sectoral focus: Although it is changing to some extent, the BRI focuses mainly on traditional \u201chard\u201d infrastructure: Ports, roads, dams, railways, electric power plants, and telecommunication facilities. On the other hand, the B3W is to focus on \u201csofter\u201d infrastructure, namely climate, health and health security, digital technology, and gender equity and equality. During the past two decades, China has accumulated a vast amount of experience in building physical infrastructure both domestically and overseas. Projects in the \u201csoft\u201d areas should benefit from President Biden\u2019s efforts to push social infrastructure development at home. \u2022 Second, financing modality: The BRI relies mainly on bilateral loans and investments from state-owned commercial and policy banks like China Development Bank, Export- Import Bank of China, and the Silk Road Fund. So far, China has had limited success in leveraging private capital. The B3W plans to use bilateral and multilateral loans and private sector capital to mobilise hundreds of billion dollars of investment for infrastructure projects. At the bilateral and multilateral level, B3W plans to use funding from the Development Finance Cooperation, USAID, EXIM, the Millenium Challenge Cooperation, and the US Trade and Development Agency. Because of the long investment cycle and low returns on projects, private financiers have tended to stay away from infrastructure projects. B3W\u2019s success in this area will be useful for the BRI. \u2022 Third, resource additionality: According to an Asian Development Bank report, Asia alone faces a $26 trillion infrastructure investment need until 2030 mainly in the power and transportation sectors. Infrastructure financing gaps are expected to be large. There is, therefore, room for both the B3W and BRI. Hardening US-China Relations Summing up, if the B3W is to be a rival to the BRI, it will face a number of major challenges. As a complement to the BRI, however, the B3W and BRI could leverage and contribute significantly to building \u201chigh standard\u201d global infrastructure and, thereby, promote economic growth in the post-COVID-19 world. China has repeatedly emphasised the open and inclusive nature of BRI and its willingness to cooperate with other stakeholders. Since the B3W concept is still evolving, those driving the project should coordinate closely with their counterparts overseeing the BRI and exchange information. The hardening US-China relations where the US sees China as a strategic competitor is certainly a constraint at the present time. But, by and large, the US and China are still closely integrated and inter-dependent at many levels and this should eventually lead to more cooperation than competition between the two countries."

    "title": "Digital Yuan: Politicisation of China\u2019s CBDC",
    "author(s)": "By Dylan MH Loh and Karyn Liow",
    "date": "No. 083 \u2013 21 May 2021",
    "content": "THE COVID-19 pandemic has facilitated a sharp pivot away from the utilisation of physical cash to digital modes of payment. This, coupled with a maturing cryptocurrency landscape, provides strong impetus for central banks around the world to seriously start thinking about issuing their own sovereign digital currencies. In this regard, China leads the world in the development of its sovereign digital currency, the Digital Currency/Electronic Payment (DC/EP), or the digital yuan. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) started its research on the digital yuan in 2014. Three years later, it set up the Digital Currency Research Institute, and subsequently established its digital yuan. China\u2019s Pilot Projects Numerous pilot projects around China have enabled residents of several cities, including Beijing, Shenzhen, and Suzhou, to use the digital currency for both online and offline purchases. Six big state banks in China\u2019s commercial centre, Shanghai, are working with PBOC to promote the digital yuan as an alternative to existing cashless payment platforms \u2013 Alipay and WeChat Pay. A pilot is currently being conducted in 10 regions: Shenzhen, Suzhou, Chengdu, Beijing (Xiong\u2019An New Area), Shanghai, Hainan, Changsha, Xi\u2019an, Qingdao, and Dalian. Designed to facilitate instant domestic transactions, the pilots have tested the digital yuan\u2019s stability and ease of use. China\u2019s CBDC also promises to address perennial regulatory concerns such as capital flight, money laundering, tax evasion, and terror financing. As of April 2021, the digital yuan has been spent in stores such as Starbucks and McDonald\u2019s, as well as other private businesses such as JD.com. The advancement of China\u2019s digital yuan trials does not stop at domestic users. The PBOC\u2019s recent collaboration with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) oversees cross-border digital yuan payment trials. China also intends to allow foreign athletes to use the digital yuan during the Beijing Winter Olympics in February 2022. With these current and upcoming trials, it is likely that China will be the first major economy to introduce a CBDC. China\u2019s CDBC: The Regional Response The rapid development of China\u2019s digital yuan has heightened concerns around privacy, national security, and political power in the West, with alarm bells ringing particularly loud in Washington and its close partners. Despite reassurances from both the PBOC and former PBOC governor Zhou Xiaochuan that the digital yuan is to be used domestically rather than globally, US policymakers are increasingly wary of the challenge posed by the momentum of China\u2019s digital yuan efforts. While officials from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission mentioned that China\u2019s digital yuan is not yet a serious challenger to the dollar, conservative Republicans view its development as China\u2019s long-term bid become the world\u2019s dominant reserve currency. Indeed, historian Niall Ferguson has called the digital yuan a \u201cpotentially fatal challenge\u201d to the US\u2019 decades-long financial hegemony. Policymakers in Taiwan have also gradually started to demonstrate the same urgency. The close ally of the US has previously viewed the digital yuan as \u201cnothing more than a propaganda piece and publicity stunt from Beijing\u201d. Nevertheless, China\u2019s concrete roll-out of its digital yuan has led Taiwan\u2019s central bank to increasingly perceive this as a security threat. Surprisingly, Japan\u2019s reactions towards China\u2019s digital yuan development are somewhat ambivalent. Japanese officials have played down the potential for China\u2019s digital yuan to threaten the dollar\u2019s position even as they acknowledged that China has a \u201cfirst-mover advantage\u201d in issuing a sovereign digital currency. Global Spread of CBDCs & Its Politicisation In that regard, China\u2019s haste has promoted these actors to accelerate their own CBDC plans. Despite initial statements from the Central Bank of Taiwan\u2019s President Yang Jinlong that Taiwan is in \u201cno hurry to launch a digital currency\u201d, it has since launched its own retail CBDC trial in September 2020. The Bank of Japan has also confirmed its plans to potentially launch a digital Yen. The digital Yen currently in the first phase of experiments, which will be carried out until March 2022. What is more, US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in February 2021 that the digital dollar is a \u201chigh priority project\u201d. Even though the US is unlikely to win the race to develop its own sovereign digital currency, the Biden administration has recently stepped up its scrutiny of China\u2019s digital yuan plans. Individual ASEAN member states have also ramped up efforts to launch their own sovereign digital currencies even as there is a wide gap in maturity. Notable developments include Cambodia\u2019s Project Bakong, Thailand\u2019s Project Inthanon, and Singapore\u2019s Project Ubin. Other countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines are still in initial feasibility studies. Myanmar, Vietnam, and Laos\u2019 generally antagonistic perspective towards digital currencies has resulted in a lag. The divergence among the ASEAN member states towards digital currencies has prevented the regional bloc from any collective position vis-\u00e0-vis China\u2019s digital yuan. For instance, the Bank of Thailand is collaborating with the China, Hong Kong and the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates. Additionally, Singapore\u2019s central bank and financial regulatory authority, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), has welcomed close cooperation with the PBOC to exchange related knowledge and expertise with China on CBDCs. Redefining Money? Against the backdrop of heightened US-China rivalry, particularly in the tech domain, it is perhaps inevitable that China\u2019s rapid CBDC advancements has been met with some concern from Washington and its allies. Indeed, the digital yuan\u2019s rapid progress promises not only to redefine existing modes of payment but also \u2018money\u2019 itself. Beyond its technical sophistication, what is perhaps more significant is how China\u2019s CBDC enables Beijing to track, monitor and surveil financial transactions at a granular level. This makes it a compelling model for other countries to follow \u2013 perhaps extending China\u2019s regional financial influence. As the central banks around the world come to grips with the wider implications of blockchain technologies, the politicisation and competition of CBDCs have begun apace."

    "title": "Belarus: New Arena for Russia-West Discord",
    "author(s)": "By Christopher Cheang",
    "date": "No. 163 \u2013 27 August 2020",
    "content": "THE UNEXPECTEDLY large and spontaneous domestic opposition to President Alexander Lukashenko\u2019s electoral victory over allegations of fraud, initially led some observers to prematurely conclude that his days are numbered. The European Union and the United States have questioned the conduct of the election, labelling it as not fair or free, while Russia and China congratulated President Lukashenko. He has been in power since 1994. The EU has threatened to introduce sanctions on the country\u2019s officials whom it holds responsible for the conduct of the election. President Vladimir Putin predictably warned EU leaders against foreign interference and pressure on Belarus, in a number of telephone calls with them. Struggle for Post-Soviet Space Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has expressed concern about the EU\u2019s motives in questioning the election\u2019s outcome. In an interview with state TV, Rossia 24, Lavrov was quoted as saying: \u201cWhat is happening in Belarus is a struggle for the post-Soviet space, which began after the Soviet Union ceased to exist, and the latest example of which were the events in Ukraine.\u201d He added that \u201cthe statements from the Western capitals show their interests lie behind the election\u201d. While President Putin is said not to be particularly enamoured of Lukashenko, Russia has compelling reasons not to upset the political apple-cart in Belarus. Moreover, Russia itself is cognisant that its actions will be decisive in shaping his and Belarus\u2019 political future. Russia\u2019s Keen Interest in Belarus Russia\u2019s keen interest is driven by its stakes in Belarus, which was a Soviet republic. First, both enjoy close relations in the Union Treaty, Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) and Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). The Union Treaty, concluded in 1999, commits both countries to integration. However, the process has been delayed all these years due to Lukashenko\u2019s cunctatory tactics. Evidently, they were meant to extract as many economic concessions from Russia (mainly energy subsidies); they were also a manifestation of his fear of becoming a vassal of Russia and losing his political status. Russia has become tired of his moves; his recent pre-election arrest of alleged Russian mercenaries has only made him more unpopular with members of the Russian elite. Yet Belarus\u2019 strategic position between the EU/NATO states and Russia means that Moscow has had little choice but to support President Lukashenko. Moreover, the CSTO and EAEU are key elements of Russia\u2019s security and economic policies in the former Soviet states and Belarus\u2019 role in it cannot be dispensed with. Third, Russia cannot afford to lose its current high level of influence over Belarus in its current geopolitical struggle with the West over Ukraine. Were Belarus to follow the route of Ukraine or Georgia, Russia\u2019s strategic position and prestige as a great power in Europe and in the former Soviet space would be dealt a huge blow. Domestic Considerations Fourth, Russia\u2019s leaders must ensure that their own domestic opponents do not take a leaf from or become inspired by the Belarussian opposition to Lukashenko. The last few weeks, Putin has had to face demonstrations in Khabarovsk and other cities in that Russian Far Eastern region over Moscow\u2019s decision to remove its popular governor and charge him with criminal acts. Thus far, the Belarussian opposition and its leaders have assured Russia that their movement is not directed at Moscow but only at Lukashenko. This gesture not only assuages Russia but is also a reflection of the Belarussian opposition\u2019s realistic assessment that Moscow will not look askance at any anti- Russian and/or pro-EU/Western political movement which has a chance at removing Lukashenko from power. Russia\u2019s Options President Lukashenko is determined to hang on to power. He has activated the military and placed it on alert on the country\u2019s borders with Poland and Lithuania, claiming that NATO was interfering in his country\u2019s affairs. By using this strategy of alleged foreign interference, he is warning the opposition that the military might be used against it, if further pressure on him to step down, does not cease. Speculation therefore of a possible Russian military intervention is baseless, for now. The Belarussian military appears to be ready to play this role; Belarus Defence Minister Viktor Khrenin has stressed to demonstrators that \"if peace and order were violated,\" they would \"have to deal not with the police but with the army\". However, if the military were to desert Lukashenko should demonstrations continue unabated, and it loses control over its troops, Russia might consider military intervention, but only reluctantly. Putin is aware that military intervention would alienate the Belarussian people, and worsen Moscow\u2019s already tense relationship with the West. The recent apparent poisoning of Russian political opponent, Alexei Navalny, who was hastily sent to Germany for treatment, has become another complication in Russia\u2019s relationship with the West. Navalny has been a thorn in the side of the Russian establishment. Ultimately, whoever is in charge in Belarus needs continued massive Russian economic support to run the country. Western aid on the same scale cannot be reckoned with, given the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s severe damage on the EU and US economies. Moreover, the EU is already Ukraine\u2019s largest donor; under these circumstances, it is questionable whether the EU would be able to summon the political will to garner the required economic resources for a post-Lukashenko Belarus. Russia can therefore afford to play a waiting game."

    "title": "New US Anti-Corruption Law: What It Means for S.E. Asia",
    "author(s)": "By Adam Garfinkle",
    "date": "No. 003 \u2013 6 January 2021",
    "content": "GIVEN THE pandemonic state of American politics since the 3 November 2020 election, it was easy to miss a major legislative event heavy with implications for aspects of the global economy, and of interest to countries like Singapore. Tucked within the massive, 4,500-page National Defence Authorisation Act (NDAA) that passed Congress through a 1 January 2021 override of a presidential veto was a provision titled \u201cThe Corporate Transparency Act\u201d (CTA). Many years in the making, the CTA is the most important anti-corruption, anti-money- laundering bill to pass the US Congress since the 2001 Patriot Act. It calls out the real beneficial owners behind the mammoth system of often-nesting shell corporations registered in the United States, foreign- and US-owned alike, to hold them accountable to both appropriate law enforcement and tax collection authorities. What the Law is About The legislation requires new entities\u2019 owners with a 25 percent or greater share of any corporation to identify themselves by providing names, dates of birth, addresses, passport and/or driver\u2019s licence numbers to the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network \u2013 FinCEN. Existing corporations must comply in full within two years or be fined heavily. Excluded are corporations already highly regulated by government, and those with more than 20 actual, not just nominal, employees and new revenue exceeding US$5 million per year. Since shell corporations rarely have genuine employees or new earned income that can be documented as licit, the exclusions ease the administrative burden on real businesses. The main motive for the opacity of the shell economy is tax evasion. Wealth defence methods have existed for ages, but the scale and sophistication of the shell economy have growth rapidly in the post-Cold War era for a variety of reasons. As revealed by the Panama Papers and other whistleblower leaks, the system sums up to at least $32 trillion in assets governments cannot find to tax, transferring burdens from richer to poorer in a massive reverse-Robin Hood demonstration of sheer selfishness. West\u2019s \u201cDirty Capitalism\u201d The great burgeoning of the offshore shell-corporation medusa turned on their heads optimistic expectations at Cold War\u2019s end: Instead of \u201cclean\u201d capitalism exporting beneficial practices and attitudes to what had been called the Second and Third Worlds, corrupt \u201cdirty capitalism\u201d instead has made inroads into the Western banking system thanks to unscrupulous banking executives, lawyers, accountants, and pocketed or \u201ccaptured\u201d government regulators in the West. Beyond tax evasion, drug money and terrorism funding moving around the globe at the behest of crime syndicates and terror organisations have become a national security concern in many countries. But that is not why the CTA was attached to the 2021 NDAA: It was simply the legislative tactic judged most likely to overcome remaining opposition. The CTA by itself will not eliminate all current corporate abuses and opportunities for jurisdictional arbitrage. Bad actors can still lie about beneficial ownership, and banks retain incentives to report illicit flows to the FinCEN, but then use their reporting compliance as an excuse not to do anything about them. Nevertheless, the CTA opens the door to pursue new objectives and to more effectively pursue old ones. Much depends on what the incoming Biden administration, notably Janet Yellen at the Treasury Department, chooses to do with its new powers. A look at why it took so long for something like the Corporate Transparency Act to become law sheds light on her calculus. What Changed? For many years officials from a few US states, notably President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s home state of Delaware, were unalterably opposed to a crackdown on the shell economy. Delaware alone has accounted for the registry of more shell corporations than all of Europe combined. Various Chambers of Commerce and a gaggle of corporate lobbyists also stood in opposition, and were supported by Treasury Department officials who reasoned, along with the banks, that if more than $300 billion annually, as of 2010, did not end up on the sly in US accounts, it would flow into competitor banks abroad. Starting in 2016, late in the Obama era, Federal regulators introduced more stringent rules for banks, ramped up inspections, and multiplied the size and frequency of monetary penalties for documented money-laundering deficiencies. In July 2016 the FinCEN required title companies in active real estate markets to report all all-cash purchases of residential real estate by corporate entities, causing a rapid 70 percent drop in all-cash corporate purchases in Miami. In other words, when the US government got serious about enforcing, and sometimes newly interpreting, laws already on the books, fewer shills were willing to protect the offshore system in the face of the dangers it posed to national security. Now, with the CTA and a new supportive administration behind it, major steps may be in prospect. Implications for Southeast Asia and Singapore How will all this affect Southeast Asia and Singapore? US officials may soon be privately pressing allies and friends, as well as others, for new data-sharing and commercial intelligence cooperation arrangements aligned generally with the aims of the CTA. They may also seek to beef up Interpol\u2019s capacities for dealing with cross-border financial crimes, and Interpol sites a major regional centre in Singapore. Staunching money-laundering in the global shell system inherently requires international cooperation, lest tax evaders, criminals and terrorists be able to move assets faster than national governments working alone can track and intercept them. Cooperative US allies may also be enlisted as partners in making representation to others, not to exclude China and its crony crypto-capitalist ways, in due course. At least in a limited sense, then, US policy may force regional governments to make choices, about their own banking establishments\u2019 habits as well as relations with Beijing on a tender topic. When it comes to a US-China encounter over banking practices that will likely affect the entire region, it might be useful for ASEAN financial authorities to engage the Biden administration on how to cooperate on CTA-related issues. If so, it could make ASEAN more salient in US government estimation. A Double-Edged Sword? Singapore\u2019s relative lack of business \u201cfriction\u201d compared to its neighbours constitutes an important incentive for US and European businesses to choose Singapore as a regional business hub. So if banking standards elsewhere in the region are eventually brought closer to best-practice thanks to US pressure, it would seem to reduce Singapore\u2019s relative advantage. But Singapore\u2019s attractiveness to global corporations is based on more than its banks\u2019 and government officials\u2019 relative incorruptibility, and Singapore would benefit from qualitative improvements in the neighbourhood\u2019s standards of doing business, especially if banking reforms worked in tandem with other initiatives to stimulate broad- based economic growth. More important still, the national security and \u201cclean capitalism\u201d objectives of the CTA are in full harmony with Singapore\u2019s core interests and values. Singapore may therefore see a new US diplomatic initiative on staunching money-laundering in the international system as a far greater opportunity than a nuisance."

    "title": "Global Health Security: COVID-19 & Its Impacts Pandemic and Beyond: Phishing in a Larger Pond",
    "author(s)": "By Jennifer Yang Hui and Teo Yi-Ling",
    "date": "No. 121 \u2013 15 June 2020",
    "content": "ALMOST OVERNIGHT, the nature of organisational cyber security has changed as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. These shifts have essentially mutated the nature of the digital threat surface. Where there were once relatively contained and static IT environments to be managed along standardised protocols and policies, it is no longer the case now. People have been dispersed outside such environments  \u0336  each to their own non- corporate networks; the systemic protections of which may or may not be consistent and robust as their corporate ones. A sudden surge in mass working over private, insecure connections thus gives attackers an easy entry. An Uptick in Phishing Attacks Unsurprisingly, alongside the worsening of the global pandemic, there has been a huge spike in phishing worldwide. \u201cPhishing\u201d is a cyber crime technique whereby users are duped into disclosing sensitive data such as personally identifiable information, password and bank details. Phishing is responsible for as much as 94% of coronavirus-related cyber attacks. In Singapore, an email supposedly sent by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong asked for \"contributions and thoughts\" from Singaporeans to address the spread of COVID-19. Scammers pretending to be Ministry of Health (MOH) employees and the contact tracing team asked people to collect documents from MOH, and obtained their personal information in the process. These are just some of the many examples of \u2018phishing\u2019 that Singapore encountered during the COVID-19 crisis. The importance of addressing the challenges posed by phishing has been emphasised by the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA). Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, malicious cyber attacks taking advantage of the coronavirus theme have increased. Even before the pandemic, phishing has been an ongoing cyber security issue in Singapore. Phishing was one of the methods deployed in the SingHealth cyberattack, the most serious data breach in Singapore\u2019s history. As an attractive target for cyber attacks, as many as 16,100 phishing URLs with a Singapore link were detected in 2018. For individuals, phishing poses the threat of unauthorised purchases, the stealing of funds, or identity theft. On the organisational and governmental level, phishing is often used by advanced persistent threat (APT) actors to gain a foothold in their networks as a part of a larger attack. The Human Factor: Social Engineering and Phishing Human nature does not change; people are hardwired to react in certain ways. In terms of tackling this \u201cphishing pandemic\u201d, it helps to understand some behavioural psychology around it. Cyber criminals are not focused on exploiting systemic or technological vulnerabilities \u2013 they seek to exploit vulnerabilities in human nature. This aspect of the phishing threat is using the tactic of social engineering. Essentially, social engineering broadly describes the ways in which people are manipulated into carrying out certain behaviours. In the context of cyber security or information security, social engineering is about getting people to disclose sensitive information or be exposed to malware. Social engineering appeals to the victims\u2019 emotions; the stronger the emotional response (positive or negative) induced in the recipient, the greater the probability is for the recipient to not think clearly and carefully. An example of an emotional response is fear. Fundamentally, phishing taps into the fears people have to such a degree that they are unable to carefully discern the signs of scam e-mails. Such e-mails appear to be from legitimate organisations or authorities that possess personal or confidential information of the recipient (banks or government agencies, for example), or whose services provide quality of life to the recipient (for example, those provided by Amazon, Apple, or Netflix). For example, scammers took advantage of some common keywords used in the COVID-19 pandemic and paired them with terms such as \u2018masks\u2019, \u2018loan\u2019, \u2018unemployment\u2019 and \u2018cure\u2019 to bait information seekers. Tackling Phishing Post-COVID-19 This evolution of the attack surface is suddenly altering established cyber security practices. Alongside requiring employees to be more vigilant and proactive about their non-office cyber security risks, how else should organisations go about managing the cyber security of a very differently structured and less coherent attack surface? Future responses should be two-fold. Firstly, organisations must actively support employees with resources and guidance. Remote working will persist, and such support as well as education about cyber risks is a long-term matter. Organisations must also think about redesigning security architectures: the environment around users could be tweaked to ameliorate the risk of phishing triggers reaching them. Here, using a variety of tools such as secured exchange servers, host-based security tools and email scanners that actively scan attachments for viruses and block harmful emails can go some way in preventing phishing threat to organisations. Also, using artificial intelligence tools to track active phishing sources and differentiate between real and fake websites could help protect users against phishing attacks. Secondly, there is the need to promote understanding of why we react in a certain way to phishing triggers, towards changing our behaviour to avoid falling victim. Ongoing public awareness campaigns and user awareness training on phishing must highlight such psychological biases, especially optimism bias (the belief that one is immune to falling prey to online scams), and provide applicable examples of how phishing can be avoided. After all, the end of the COVID-19 pandemic will not mean the end of human vulnerability to cyber-enabled attacks. Hopefully, awareness of phishing is sharpened as one result. We should expect phishing tactics to become more sophisticated and cyber criminals more ingenious, enabled as well by technological advances. Black swan events (unknown unknowns) could very well arise, any global crisis will have a cyber aspect, and protection plans must integrate cyber security. Cyber criminals see opportunity in every crisis, and cyber practitioners must anticipate such eventualities and endeavour to be one step ahead, or at least prepared to a point where they can respond appropriately."

    "title": "Biden\u2019s \u201cPutin Killer\u201d Remark: Moscow\u2019s Calculated Response",
    "author(s)": "By Christopher Cheang",
    "date": "No. 059 \u2013 9 April 2021",
    "content": "IN A US television interview aired on 17 March 2021, President Joe Biden was asked whether he thought Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin was a killer. In reply, the new American leader said: \u201cI do\u201d. From Moscow, Putin responded by wishing Biden good health. He added: \u201cI am saying this without irony or tongue in cheek ... when we evaluate other people, or even other states and nations, we are always facing a mirror, we always see ourselves in the reflection, because we project our inner selves onto the other person.\u201d Putin\u2019s Image of Reasonableness: Posturing? Describing the American people as \u201cmostly honest, decent and sincere\u201d and \u201cwho want to live in peace and friendship with us, something we are aware of and appreciate, and we will rely on them in the future,\u201d Putin criticised US domestic and foreign policy, placing the blame on the US ruling class. He said that Russia would work with the US but only in areas it is interested in, and on terms beneficial to Russia. Seeking to project an image of reasonableness and signal that Russia is still willing to continue a dialogue, Putin proposed having a \"live, online\" conversation with the US president. Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, subsequently explained to reporters that the proposal implied open dialogue and not debate, noting that Biden\u2019s remarks \u201care quite unprecedented, so in order not to let these statements harm bilateral Russian- American relations, which are already in a deplorable state, President Putin suggested discussing the situation but doing so openly\u201d. Other Russian officials however took a stronger line. The Foreign Ministry in Moscow recalled the Russian ambassador in Washington DC for consultations. Vyacheslav Volodin, Speaker of the Duma, described Biden's comments as \"unacceptable,\" adding that \"they offend the citizens of Russia\u201d. Federation Council (Upper House) Deputy Speaker Konstantin Kosachev, also described Biden\u2019s remark as \u201cunacceptable,\u201d warning that they \u201cinevitably lead to a sharp exacerbation of our bilateral ties\u201d. The US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on 22 March that the US was anticipating \"tough days\" in relations with Russia. In reaction, Secretary of the Russian Security Council Nikolai Patrushev stressed that the US would be responsible for that. Reflecting Russia\u2019s wish not to worsen the relationship, Patrushev stressed that Russia was \u201ccommitted to constructive cooperation\u201d, adding that \u201cwe haven\u2019t taken any hostile steps against the United States, we are not taking any now, nor are we planning to take any in the future\". Patrushev\u2019s words carry weight, as he is a member of Putin\u2019s inner circle. Sword of Damocles over Ties Without directly judging Biden\u2019s remark, Nabila Massrali, spokesperson for the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell, commented as well. She was quoted as saying on 18 March that there was \u201ca long list of failed \u2013 in some cases, and successful in other cases \u2013 assassinations carried out against critical, independent figures in Russia, including politicians and journalists\u201d. She added that Putin \u201cultimately holds the responsibility for the Russian authorities, Russian policy and actions\u201d. According to a European Council press statement of 22 March, European Council president, Charles Michel, said that EU relations with Russia are at a \u201clow point\u201d. Yet, the EU must exercise caution vis-\u00e0-vis Russia, since the latter is a major energy and raw material source, and trade partner with the largest consumer market on the continent. Moreover, Germany and other EU states would like to purchase Russia\u2019s Sputnik V vaccine. The standpoint of Germany is noteworthy. Foreign Minister Heiko Maas expressed no surprise at the \u201cclear language\u201d from the Biden administration on Russia. Nevertheless, he noted that the US had renewed the New START arms control treaty, showing that the US was ready for dialogue and coming to an agreement with Russia on global challenges. The US\u2019 continued opposition to the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project (the 1,230 km pipeline that will double Russian gas exports to the EU) and Germany\u2019s continued commitment to it, however, will hang like a sword of Damocles over Russo-US as well as US-German relations. Russian Motivations Putin\u2019s \u201csofter\u201d line towards Biden\u2019s \u201ckiller\u201d remark shows Russia\u2019s interest in ensuring that the bilateral relationship does not deteriorate irreversibly. It also reflects Putin\u2019s efforts to appear reasonable to his own people as well as the American people, in cognisance of the dissonance of views within the body politic of the US (and Europe). It was not a coincidence that Russian state TV, Rossia 24, reported on 20 March that the Russian ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov had expressed his thanks to American citizens for their support of good relations between the two countries. Nevertheless, the \u201charder\u201d approach of top legislators Volodin and Kosachev signals that as a great power, Russia cannot simply react with sangfroid at Biden\u2019s remark. Seeking not to burn Moscow's bridges with the EU, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, during a visit to China on 23 March, pointed out that Russia was ready to build its relations with the EU should it eliminate an \u201canomaly in contacts\u201d (i.e., its unilateral decisions to impose sanctions). He noted that there were \u201conly a few European partner countries that have a desire to act based on their national interests\u201d. (He must have had in mind Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, and France; they account for over half of trade between Russia and the EU, Russia\u2019s leading partner). Delinking from Western-controlled SWIFT? Lavrov said that Russia seeks to work with China to reduce the impact of any further sanctions. In that regard, Lavrov proposed the reduction of his country\u2019s \u201cexposure to sanctions by strengthening our technological independence and switching to settlements in national and international currencies other than the dollar\u201d as well as moving \u201caway from using Western-controlled international payment systems\u201d. Lavrov\u2019s statement is not new; in 2018, the then deputy prime minister Arkady Dvorkovich stated that Russian financial institutions and firms were ready to work without SWIFT\u2019s services. As early as 2015, the then prime minister Dmitry Medvedev called attention to perceived Western countries\u2019 threats to restrict Russia\u2019s operations through SWIFT, warning that Russia\u2019s reaction to such a move \u201cwill be without limits\u201d. In the light of Biden\u2019s remark and the announcement of planned US sanctions, Russia does not want more comprehensive US/EU sanctions that might further hurt its economy. Russia also has other common issues to resolve with the US such as climate change, the Middle East, Ukraine, Afghanistan, arms control regime and cyberspace governance. For all intents and purposes, Russia\u2019s reaction to the US leader\u2019s remark is deliberately calibrated but it is unlikely to weaken US or European resolve to impose further sanctions."

    "title": "2020 Jolo Suicide Attack: Evolving Tactics",
    "author(s)": "By Kenneth Yeo and Remy Mahzam",
    "date": "No. 165 \u2013 31 August 2020",
    "content": "AFTER A nine-month hiatus from the last suicide attack in Mindanao, another incident struck in a plaza near a cathedral in the southern Philippine town of Jolo, a stronghold of the pro-IS Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG). The two-stage attack, which killed at least 14 and wounded 75, is the fifth case of suicide terrorism in the Philippines orchestrated by the IS-aligned Sawadjaan faction of ASG. The first suicide bomber detonated herself near a parked motorcycle while the second blew herself up after a soldier approached her following the first explosion. One of the suicide bombers is believed to be an Indonesian national who was the wife of 23-year-old Norman Lasuca, the first Filipino suicide bomber who killed himself in 2019. The other bomber is suspected to be the wife of Talha Jumsah alias Abu Talha, a slain bomb expert from ASG. The involvement of females in the suicide attack has amplified fears about the changing tactics of the ASG as the group continues to intensify pressures targeting the military even at crowded civilian spaces. Exploiting the Pandemic Against the backdrop of the pandemic, the Philippines could become Southeast Asia\u2019s largest coronavirus hotspot, with close to 112,000 confirmed cases to date, after a lockdown was re-imposed in Manila and four densely populated provinces. The pandemic appears to provide a conducive environment to conduct attacks as local authorities become preoccupied with implementing quarantine measures to contain the spread of the disease. Based on military intelligence reports, around 700 deadly attacks were recorded in the Philippines amidst the pandemic since March 2020. The Philippine National Police (PNP) recorded over 588 sightings of IS groups in the country between 18 April to 12 June 2020 at the height of the first wave of the pandemic in the Philippines. Among the continuing slew of sporadic and small-scale attacks carried out by militants amidst the outbreak of COVID-19 was one on 17 April. Approximately 40 militants ambushed Filipino soldiers on the island of Jolo, killing 12 and wounding 13. The Defence Intelligence Agency described it as the deadliest attack since the January 2019 suicide bombing of a cathedral that killed 23. On 26 June, a planned suicide attack in Metro Manila was foiled after four operatives of the ASG were killed in their safe house in Para\u00f1aque City. Another shooting incident three days later involving military and police operatives in Jolo, was related to a mission by the security authorities to target suspected female suicide bombers. Suicide Bombing Trend in Philippines The rise of suicide bombing in the Philippines emanates from the contagious effect of the ideology of violent extremism propagated by IS foreign fighters in the country. While mainstream Islamic theology condemns the act of suicide bombing and considers the indiscriminate act of killing innocent lives as sinful and forbidden, IS and other Islamist terrorist groups describe it as istishhadi (martyrdom). This is to provide theological legitimacy to their suicide bombing. Over the years, IS propaganda promoting suicide attacks has radicalised the jihadist movement in this region pushing its affiliates to adopt violent tactics to advocate their ideology. The involvement of women in suicide bombing is not an entirely new phenomenon in Philippines. The recent spate of suicide bombings can be said to have begun on 27 January 2019 when an Indonesian husband and wife, affiliated to the Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), bombed a church in Jolo Island which killed 23 and wounded 100 others. Since then, a series of suicide bombing missions (albeit by men) were attempted from January to November 2019 with declining levels of success.\u202fThis latest attack shows the persistence of several trends of suicide bombing in the Philippines. Firstly, they have so far been only carried out by members of the Hajan Sawadjaan faction of the ASG, which is aligned with IS. Since the 2019 Jolo Cathedral attack initiated by his faction, Sawadjaan has gain notoriety and was mooted to be the emir of IS in the Philippines. No other group in the Philippines has attempted suicide bombings. Secondly, suicide bombings only occur in Jolo island despite Sawadjaan\u2019s influence across the Sulu Archipelago. Suicide bombers in Sulu have only conducted attacks on military targets \u2013 apart from the Jolo Cathedral attack on January 2019. This might indicate some strategic significance in the deployment of such tactics. Finally, suicide bombings in Sulu is still heavily reliant on foreign militants. In this instance, based on the military claims that one of the bombers was the Indonesian wife of Norman Lasuca, it further cements the dependence of foreign militants for suicide bombing operations in the country. Female Participation in Suicide Attacks Militant leaders in the region have previously called for greater participation of women in attacks after male fighters begin to decline in numbers and groups face recruitment challenges. The probability of success of attacks involving females are higher as women are less likely to be suspected and detected as terrorists. Security forces warned of the presence of two females, suspected as would-be suicide bombers, in Jolo island on 19 August. The military claimed that four intelligence officers who were killed in a controversial police operation on 29 June were tracking these suspects. This indicates the possibility of other suicide bombing operations in the near horizon. The recruitment of female suicide bombers appears to suggest that Sawadjaan\u2019s strategy may be to retain male local militants to defend their territory while expending untrained sympathisers to harass the military. Apart from Sawadjaan\u2019s group, there are other militant factions in central Mindanao who embrace IS\u2019 wider agenda of establishing a \u201ccaliphate\u201d in South-east Asia. If left unchecked, the 2020 Jolo suicide attack is likely to inspire more suicide bombings in this region, especially involving women as IS Sulu attempts to increase its global awareness of the East Asia Wilayah. The adoption of suicide tactics involving women could also attract the attention of international terrorist groups and networks as foreign fighters set their eye on this region in a bid to boost the operational capabilities of local militants."

    "title": "Vertical Farms: Are They Sustainable?",
    "author(s)": "By Paul Teng and Steve Kim",
    "date": "No. 092 \u2013 8 June 2021",
    "content": "WITH A population of over 5.7 million and a land area of 726 square kilometres, Singapore imports 90% of its food and allocates less than one per cent of land for agriculture. Juxtaposing this, with the recognised vulnerability to global supply chain disruptions, Singapore has embarked on bolstering the local agri-food industry to address food security. There are also aspirations to make Singapore a hub for technology creation in urban farming. This is a sea change from past policies to downplay agriculture due to limited land and the potential for higher value creation by using land for manufacturing, industrial and other activities. Implicitly this recognised that agriculture, in its traditional form on land, could not be sustained, or justified in a small island state. Today\u2019s food production in Singapore has taken on a different form with new farms, whether to produce vegetable, fish or alternative protein, hugely dependent on technology. How sustainable are these in Singapore with the high costs of production? Vertical Farms Vertical farming has emerged as one of the potential solutions to grow more on limited land. The benefits of vertical farming and other urban farming innovations are well documented. Most notable among these benefits include lower water consumption, reduced food transportation needs (and corresponding greenhouse gas [GHG] emission reduction) and higher yields. Together, these outcomes support the Singapore Food Agency\u2019s 30by30 Goal and the recently announced Singapore Green Plan 2030. But from an overall sustainability perspective, sustainability assessments must include all the visible and non-visible costs and benefits of vertical farming. One such approach is a life-cycle analysis (LCA) which, among other things, includes a review of energy consumption, and can provide a more meaningful insight on the impact on vertical farms on Singapore\u2019s sustainable development agenda. What Powers Vertical Farms Vertical farms need electricity. Lots of it. While different types of vertical farming systems may vary in their energy needs, energy consumption is more intensive in the indoor, controlled environments of vertical farms. The difference in energy requirements for vertical farms, as compared to conventional farms, are significant. For example, strawberries grown on a conventional farm in Chile require 0.4524 kiloWatt hours (kWh) of electricity per square metre per year (sq.m/year). Whereas strawberries grown on a vertical farm in Russia require over 3,000% more energy at 1,404 kWh/sq.m/year. To put that in context, a four-room HDB\u2019s average electricity consumption is 3.99 kWh/sq.m/year. Isolated comparisons like this are not without criticism and often do not factor in one critical element: the source of the electricity being consumed. For example, frozen chicken imported to Singapore from Brazil has 15% lower GHG emissions than chicken from Malaysia despite the transport distance differences. Brazil uses hydropower renewable energy during the production and processing stages while Malaysia relies on fossil fuels. The source of energy affects the GHG emissions footprint and therefore plays a large part in the sustainability assessment of an activity. What Powers Singapore Singapore relies on imported natural gas for 95% of its electricity. Although deemed to be the cleanest fossil fuel, natural gas still generates GHG emissions. Therefore, the Singapore Food Agency\u2019s 30by30 Goal of the local agri-food industry producing 30% of local nutritional needs by 2030 will inevitably increase local energy consumption. Emissions from increased local production, however, will offset emissions from decreased overseas food import activity, return of farmland to carbon sequestering natural ecosystems and other impacts. Yet, this leaves us with the crucial question of whether the city-state is eventually on a more sustainable path or be worse off than before. To answer this, it is important to quantify the energy consumption of vertical farms in an LCA for a deeper understanding and calculation of the net emissions generated or saved. Any LCA effort would require energy consumption data from the various vertical farming systems. In Singapore, at least one vertical farm enterprise (SkyGreens) uses natural sunlight while another vertical farm (Sustenir) uses LED lights for crop cultivation. From an economic viability and sustainability perspective for these enterprises, energy supply and costs also factor into an LCA for vertical farming. At the moment, there is no aggregated data on this. Such data would allow for more accurate calculations to then allow a meaningful and sustainable electricity consumption strategy. Reconciling a Sustainable Way Forward The 1987 Brundtland Report is widely cited for the definition of sustainable development: \u201cmeet[ing] the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future needs\u201d (https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/5987our-common- future.pdf). generations meet their own to Vertical farming promises to achieve higher crop yields on less real estate. This outcome, if combined with renewable energy innovations, can address the impacts of GHG emissions and climate change. But if the energy consumption and GHG emissions therefrom are at odds with the impact to climate change, then the sustainability of vertical farming remains in question. There are yet to be industry-wide standards on sustainability metrics for vertical farming. Extrapolations of energy usage and kilograms of CO2 equivalent emissions appear in various literature, but overall data is sparse. Measuring data and tracking performance on quantifiable metrics from vertical farming activities would assist in improving energy efficiency and managing the carbon footprint to support the sustainable development agenda of the Singapore Green Plan 2030. Ultimately though, policymakers will need to balance the immediate needs for fruits and vegetables (food security) against the longer term desires to improve the carbon footprint of vertical farms (sustainability)."

    "title": "Facial Recognition: More Peril than Promise?",
    "author(s)": "By Manoj Harjani",
    "date": "No. 024 \u2013 10 February 2021",
    "content": "FOLLOWING THE events that transpired at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021, American law enforcement agencies have turned to facial recognition technology to identify perpetrators and bring them to justice. Techno-optimists bullish about the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to transform daily life will see such usage of facial recognition technology as yet another example of AI\u2019s promise. However, it comes at a time of burgeoning debate in the United States and elsewhere on when and how facial recognition technology should be deployed, and by whom. Exposed: The Darker Side of Facial Recognition Facial recognition was not the only AI-powered technology brought under the spotlight following the US Capitol riot. The White House had to debunk a social media post claiming that video footage of President Trump disavowing the rioters was a deepfake. As AI luminary Andrew Ng has astutely observed, the primary peril from AI is not from a rogue superintelligence, but from how humans use AI. This further underscores the need for appropriate governance of facial recognition technology \u2013 and AI more generally \u2013 at a time when it is tempting to deprioritise such endeavours given the many challenges demanding policymakers\u2019 attention. The past few years have seen the darker side of facial recognition technology exposed as part of a broader reconsideration to develop and deploy AI ethically and in the public interest. Extensive media reporting in 2019 and 2020 shed light on collaborations between China\u2019s tech giants and their government to deploy facial recognition systems specifically targeting the Uighur minority. In the US, the George Floyd protests against police brutality that began in mid-2020 prompted a backlash against surveillance driven by facial recognition technology. Nevertheless, there has been little effective regulation governing the development, sale and use of facial recognition technology, which continues to attract considerable interest from governments and law enforcement agencies globally. In a 2019 report, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace found that at least 75 countries were actively using facial recognition technology. Irresistible Crutch for Law Enforcement American law enforcement agencies were quick to employ facial recognition technology following the US Capitol riot. US-based facial recognition startup Clearview AI reported a 26 percent increase in searches by law enforcement agencies on January 7, 2021 over its usual weekday search volume. This is significant because Clearview claims that more than 2,400 law enforcement agencies across the US use its software \u2013 this despite the startup coming under fire for its data scraping practices. If Clearview\u2019s claims are to be believed, the recent public backlash against facial recognition technology \u2013 supported by a growing body of research documenting the propensity for gender and ethnic bias \u2013 appears to have largely been ignored by American law enforcement agencies. With only scattered city and state-level regulations at present, there are few incentives for law enforcement agencies to give up using facial recognition technology. Furthermore, tech giants such as Amazon, IBM and Microsoft have already lined up lobbying resources to shape any future federal regulations proposed by the Biden administration and Democrat-controlled Congress. Smart City Solutions: Pros & Cons Of potentially greater long-term concern, however, is the export of facial recognition and other surveillance technologies as part of smart city solutions, particularly by Chinese tech companies. A 2020 report by the Brookings Institution highlighted that at least 80 countries had adopted Chinese surveillance and public security technology platforms since 2008. This bundling of facial recognition and other surveillance technologies into broader smart city solutions conveniently sidesteps the need to seek societal consent for their adoption. This is generally the case as smart city initiatives are often presented as essential for future economic growth and improved public service delivery. Furthermore, by treating the deployment of these technologies as inevitable, little or no consideration is given to legitimate concerns regarding gender and ethnic bias. This poses a significant obstacle to implementing ethical principles and frameworks governing the development, sale and use of facial recognition technology and AI more generally. Facial Recognition in Singapore: Accountability & Public Trust The use of facial recognition technology in Singapore predates the government\u2019s Smart Nation effort, with the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority deploying it at Singapore\u2019s borders since 2012. However, no data is publicly available on the efficacy of this facial recognition system, or whether it has been subject to an audit to determine its susceptibility to gender and ethnic bias. While Singapore has developed a Model AI Governance Framework, this has primarily been pitched as a guide for the private sector. At the same time, concerns are likely to grow as the government rolls out facial recognition in other areas of public service delivery as part of the Smart Nation push. These include \u201ccrowd analytics\u201d via \u201csmart lamp posts\u201d and \u201cface verification\u201d to access government digital services via SingPass. Calls for the Singapore government to account for its development and deployment of facial recognition technology \u2013 and AI more generally \u2013 are likely to follow as public awareness matures. While the government is well-placed to address these concerns, it needs to develop a direct understanding of the public\u2019s perspectives and attitudes towards facial recognition and other AI-powered technologies. Engagement through surveys can help in this regard, and results can guide the pace and extent of implementation. Such engagement should be bolstered by public communication efforts. Building up public trust in facial recognition technology will undoubtedly be a long-term effort. For a start \u2013 and to signal openness \u2013 the government could apply the Model AI Governance Framework to its own systems and audit them for compliance. Over time, this can be codified into formalised legal protections and mechanisms for seeking redress that apply to both the private and public sectors."

    "title": "Taiwan and India: Building Bigger Together?",
    "author(s)": "By Rajesh Basrur and Wu Shang-Su",
    "date": "No. 077 \u2013 6 May 2021",
    "content": "TAIWAN AND India are poised at the cusp of a significantly enhanced strategic relationship. The hesitations of decades, underlined by India\u2019s adherence to a \u2018One China\u2019 policy favouring the People\u2019s Republic of China, are being overcome as New Delhi and Taipei respond to an altered strategic environment. The main driving force, undoubtedly, is China, with which both have faced increasing frictions over the past decade. But there is more to the relationship than current military tensions. Taiwan\u2019s interest in diversifying its trade and investment pattern stems from the expansion of its \u2018Southbound\u2019 policy of the 1990s, which previously focused on Southeast Asia, to encompass South Asia. Likewise, India has extended its ASEAN- centric \u2018Look East\u2019 policy to chart a more wide-ranging \u2018Act East\u2019 policy, which stretches to the Western Pacific and encompasses Taiwan. The tricky question for both is over China\u2019s response to an augmented relationship, even an economic one, which Beijing opposes stridently. Policy Debates in Taiwan, India Notably, Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not extend official greetings to President Tsai Ing-Wen on the occasion of Taiwan\u2019s National Day last October. But the sentiment in India to reciprocate Taiwan\u2019s interest in a stronger relationship is growing and there are signs of change. Among Taiwan\u2019s policymakers, the mainstream camp holds a positive view of relations with New Delhi. After considerable cultivation of economic, cultural, educational, and other links, it is expected that the spill-over will bring a breakthrough in official ties. While a formal diplomatic relationship is a remote prospect, moving significantly beyond the status quo is considered feasible. The minority camp highlights the limitation of the relationship with India due to its One China policy and the pressure from China, but does not deny the value of strengthening interactions. In the Indian foreign policy community, one group wants to tread cautiously, deeming it unwise to risk aggravating an already fraught relationship with Beijing and difficult to reduce dependence on China. A second group favours forging much closer links with Taiwan, asserting that pressure from Beijing should not be a deterrent, especially since China has shown little regard to Indian sensitivities with respect to the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, which traverses Indian territory. The Indian government has moved cautiously toward Taiwan, encouraging trade and investment links, but eschewing formal political and security ties. In our view, there is considerable scope for cultivating a warmer Taiwan-India relationship without necessarily generating greatly heightened tensions with China. Toward Closer Economic Ties Taiwan and India have converging economic interests as both want to reduce dependence on China. Economic cooperation led to the establishment of the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) in India in April 2018, a Taiwan Expo in May, and a Bilateral Investment Agreement that December. In January 2019, a Taiwan Plus desk for facilitating Taiwanese investment became fully operational under the Indian government\u2019s Invest India programme. Still, trade and investment have yet to realise their potential. Trade rose from US$2 billion in 2006 to a moderate $6billion in 2019, but cumulative foreign direct investment (FDI) flows were a meagre $400 million for 2000-2020. A joint venture for a petrochemical complex between Taiwan\u2019s CPC group and India\u2019s Adani Group failed at the planning stage in 2019. But more is on the anvil. Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronics giant, is reported to have planned an additional investment of $1 billion. Other majors like Pegatron and Wistron are investing too. With approximately $35 billion of Taiwanese investment \u2018reshoring\u2019 from China, India has much to gain from a share. Much more can be done. As non-members of the Regional Cooperation Economic Partnership (RCEP), both countries stand to gain from a bilateral linkage that will help offset the missed opportunity from that arrangement. Specific areas that might draw profitable attention include electrical machinery, medical equipment and semi- conductors. But India has to generate more incentives than it has thus far. Its willingness and ability to circumvent its One China policy would be a critical step. Adherence to the policy need not be a sticking point. Taiwan already has two major trade agreements that do just this: the July 2013 Agreement between New Zealand and the Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu on Economic Cooperation (ANZTEC) and the April 2014 Agreement between Singapore and the Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu on Economic Partnership (ASTEP). Taiwan and India can do the same if both sides are able to achieve a strong consensus. More broadly, Taiwan and India could be brought into a larger framework for quality infrastructure investment set in motion by Australia, Japan and the United States and possibly into the Supply Chain Resilience Initiative recently launched by India along with Australia and Japan. Circumventing Chinese Sensitivities Most analysts emphasise that security cooperation would draw Chinese ire and unnecessarily complicate an already thorny strategic environment. But, making allowances for a stentorian reaction from Beijing, that need not be the case. There are a number of security-related areas in which Taiwan and India could engage constructively without annoying Beijing seriously. First, as suggested by Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu in October 2020, expanded intelligence sharing would be mutually beneficial. Taipei\u2019s knowledge of the Chinese military and its organization can complement New Delhi\u2019s experience with confronting China militarily. Second, the sharing of hard and soft cyber capabilities will shore up the resilience of both in the inter-related civilian and security spheres. As Cyber-attacks are numerous for Taiwan in a daily base, India\u2019s suspicions of a Chinese hand in the February 2021 mega-power blackout in Mumbai during the military confrontation with China has made it acutely aware of its vulnerabilities in this respect. Third, Taiwan has a potentially significant role to play in maintaining stability in the Indian Ocean, where it has a large fishing presence as well as an interest in security of trade. Cooperation in countering piracy and trafficking of all kinds would be of mutual benefit. Fourth, Taiwan can offer its strengths in learning Mandarin and about Chinese culture to benefit the Indian security community on a regular basis, as it has done occasionally in the past. And fifth, the two navies and coast guards can coordinate their responses in regional humanitarian and disaster relief missions."

    "author(s)": "By Dedi Dinarto, Adri Wanto & Leonard C. Sebastian",
    "date": "No. 033 \u2013 2 March 2020",
    "content": "THE COVID-19 outbreak in Indonesia has been responded to with nonchalance by the central government, which emphasised that Indonesia has not encountered many cases of infection, if at all. The Indonesian health minister had also caused a stir with his public statement on the COVID-19 when he exhorted the people to rely on \u2018prayer\u2019 as a preventive measure as he ticked off those who bought masks at a higher price. In reality, the COVID-19 outbreak has in fact had a devastating effect on Indonesia\u2019s economy, especially the travel and tourism sector. The Indonesian government reported that its tourism sector experienced losses of as much as US$500 million per month. The most direct impact of the outbreak is the decline of inbound foreign tourists to Indonesia\u2019s most visited destinations, one of which is Bintan Island, just about an hour by ferry to the south of Singapore. Bintan and Its Promising Tourism Sector Bintan is one of the islands in the Riau Archipelago, which is currently being developed by the Indonesian government as a key tourist destination after Bali. Some of the better-known tourist destinations in Bintan are Trikora Beach, Senggiling, and Beralas Pasir Island. Beside its pristine beaches, Bintan also has many other tourist destinations such as Lagoi Bay, Bukit Busung, the Blue Lake, Crystal Lagoon, Bukit Panglong, and Mount Bintan Waterfall. The island is the fourth largest contributor to tourist numbers in Indonesia. In 2019, Bintan witnessed around 1.6 million of both domestic and foreign tourists, of which 750,000 were foreign tourists. The number of foreign tourists who visited Bintan exceeded the target of 700,000 set by the Ministry of Tourism. The tourism sector is the largest source of Bintan\u2019s regional revenue, surpassing other sectors such as agriculture, mining, and mining resources. Reliance on Mainland Chinese Tourists In 2019, Bintan\u2019s tourism sector was dominated by foreign tourists from China. Of the 750,000 foreign tourists who visited Bintan, 35 per cent (around 260,000) were from China. Another 65 per cent comprised tourists from neighbouring countries like Singapore and Malaysia. One of the causes was the Chinese-dominated tourism business chain in Bintan set up by the Dalian Wanda Group, a major multinational conglomerate based in Beijing, with its core business in property development. The company is also known for investing in various other sectors such as construction, entertainment, manufacturing, and financial services. Offering low-priced tour packages, the company engaged in a deal with the Riau Islands Tourism Office in 2016. However, the excellent achievement of Bintan\u2019s tourism sector has been undermined by the recent outbreak of COVID-19, following which the number of tourists from China per January 2020 dwindled to 500. This was due to the prevention measures by both central and local governments halting direct flights from China to Indonesia. Impact on the Locals The decline of tourists from mainland China due to the COVID-19 outbreak has affected businesses related to Bintan\u2019s tourism sector, such as hotels, gift shops, and local fishermen. The decreasing tourist numbers has led to declining demand for hotel rooms, gifts, and food consumption. According to the local labour union, this situation has threatened the jobs of locals who work in the industry even though the number of resorts and hotels that have laid off their employees have gone largely unreported. However, the impact of the outbreak on local businesses outside the tourism sector is not as bad given that the tourism industry in Bintan is dominated by the Dalian Wanda Group\u2019s chain of businesses. Under a controlled tour package, most of the mainland Chinese tourists are taken to places that are in business collaboration with Wanda Group. This raises other issues, namely, the disgruntlement of local businesses who do not benefit from tourism from China; they are unhappy with the monopoly enjoyed by the Wanda Group as provided by the local government. What Next? To prevent a COVID-19 outbreak, the local government in coordination with Jakarta has implemented measures such as banning direct flights from China to the Riau Islands. Local authorities have also installed body heat temperature detectors in key gateways, including airports and seaports. The impacts of the coronavirus on the tourism sector in Bintan also signalled the local government\u2019s failure to diversify the economy of Bintan to reduce dependency on tourism largely from or only on tourists from China. Relying heavily on tourists from China has hamstrung Bintan\u2019s tourism sector. The decrease in the number of mainland Chinese tourists has also revealed the workings of the Wanda Group and its monopolistic practices. This implies the local government\u2019s failure to create a level playing field for fair access to market and to find the right balance between foreign and local business interests. On a larger note, the local government should prioritise the need to devise local regulations (Peraturan Daerah) or regent\u2019s regulations (Peraturan Bupati) to curb monopolistic business operations in Bintan. The COVID-19 crisis may prove to be a blessing in disguise for the tourism industry in Bintan if lessons are learned in terms of three areas: first, local government deregulation of the tourism sector; second, a search for new sources of tourists; and third, upgrading the skills of local tourism-related businesses to provide better services to tourists when the COVID-19 scare subsides and the tourists return."

    "title": "War with China?",
    "author(s)": "By Loro Horta",
    "date": "No. 090 \u2013 4 June 2021",
    "content": "THE HEAD of the US Indo Pacific Command, Admiral Philip Davidson, rightly pointed out recently that China\u2019s military, the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), is fast modernising and expanding its capabilities. He predicted that China would attack Taiwan in the next six years. Is China really getting ready to invade Taiwan, a move that could start a war with the United States? Why in the next six years? The reasons given for this timeframe range from growing Chinese incursions into Taiwan\u2019s air space and territorial waters to more doubtful ones like the PLA wanting to mark its 100th anniversary by reunifying Taiwan with the mainland. The Military Balance The PLA and the Chinese leadership do not make decisions rashly; they are rational and calculating. Chinese leaders have a healthy dose of respect for US power and know that China is still inferior to the US in many sectors of the military. The US navy is the most technologically advanced force in the world and the most experienced. While China has been adding modern warships and submarines to its fleet at an impressive rate it will take at least 15 years or more for China to reach US levels in terms of modern ships and submarines. China currently operates two aircraft carriers, the Liaoning, partially built in the Ukraine during the Soviet era, and the Shandong, an indigenously built copy of the Liaoning with minor improvements. They are no match to the 11 nuclear-powered aircraft carriers operated by the US. China is building two more aircraft carriers expected to be far more advanced than its current two. The fourth aircraft carrier, the Type 04, is expected to be similar in capabilities to the US aircraft carriers. However, this vessel will only be operational in 2030. While the Chinese air force and navy have received new aircraft such as the J-15 and J-22, they are still small in numbers and most analysts believe that these new models remain inferior to the US F-22 Raptor and F-35 fighters. The US operates 35 nuclear- powered attack submarines against China\u2019s six. The rest of the Chinese attack submarines are diesel powered, slower and noisier than its US opponents. Taiwan has a 165,000 strong military, over a million men in the reserves, and a modern air force and navy. China would need to land hundreds of thousands of men in the very first waves of invasion and eventually over a million men in any plan to take the island. China does not have the sealift capacity for such an operation. China\u2019s Strategy China believes that time is on its side. Beijing is expanding its military without compromising its economic growth. China\u2019s defence budget for 2021 stood at US$209.4 billion, about 1.3 percent of its GDP. While some observers question this figure, it is clear that the US outspends all other nations. In comparison the US spent $732 billion in 2020. More than the budgets of the next 10 countries combined. There is a strong belief among China\u2019s leadership that the then Soviet Union went bankrupt and neglected the needs of its people because it engaged in a costly arms race with the US. China wants to avoid the same mistake. China is confident that it is slowly winning the contest with the US on the economic front. In Africa it has supplanted its rivals while in Asia it is arguably already the most important economic actor. Its $124 billion Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a symbol of its growing economic clout. The scuttling of the Transpacific Partnership (TPP) by the Trump administration deprived the US of a vital asset in countering China\u2019s growing economic dominance of the region. China\u2019s most powerful asset is not its military. It is its economy. In No Hurry for War with US Beijing is not in a hurry to go to war; it believes eventually its economy and military will be powerful enough that the US will have no alternative, but to peacefully relinquish its leadership of the region. It will be just like Britain relinquishing its preponderance in the Americas to a rising US in the late 19th century. More funding for the Indo-Pacific Command is important, but it should be just one part of the overall strategy of managing China\u2019s growing power. The US defeated the Soviet Union in the Cold War not with its military might but by the power of its economy and those of its allies. For almost five decades the US and the Soviet Union were able to avoid war. There is no reason why the US cannot repeat this with China. For that to happen, it is important to have realistic assessments of China\u2019s capabilities and intentions. One must avoid the temptation of threat inflammation."

    "title": "Cybersecurity Framework: Addressing Japan\u2019s Manpower Crunch",
    "author(s)": "By Mihoko Matsubara",
    "date": "No. 018 \u2013 29 January 2020",
    "content": "THE CURRENT cyber threat landscape remains grim: the world struggles to keep up with growing cyberattacks. According to NTT Corporation, a major ICT service provider in Tokyo, 44 percent of companies have experienced a breach in 2019; the estimated costs of recovering from a breach continue to increase from 9.9 percent of their revenue in 2017 to 12.7 percent in 2019. That is why cybersecurity professionals are in high demand to enhance cybersecurity. Yet, there is an acute shortage of cybersecurity talents. Cybersecurity Ventures predicts there will be 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs by 2021. Pressure Will Grow The pressure to improve cybersecurity is greater when a country is preparing for a major international event such as Olympic Games because their success requires both cyber and physical security. Tokyo was selected to host the 2020 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2013. This has prompted Japan to strengthen its national cybersecurity capabilities and cultivate cybersecurity talents, because it is crucial to manage any potential reputational and cyber risks and ensure to leave a positive legacy for future generations. In the Internet of Things (IoT) era, cross-sectoral collaboration is becoming more important to obtain collective knowledge and tackle with cyberattacks. That is why Japanese industry decided to form the Cross-Sector Forum to establish a good ecosystem to educate, recruit, retain, and train cybersecurity professionals in collaboration with academia and government. In April 2015, then Senior Executive Vice President Hiromichi Shinohara of NTT, started to talk to his senior counterparts at Japanese critical infrastructure companies to urge them to launch a forum. The Cross-Sector Forum Finally in June 2015, the forum was founded with 30 major companies from all the critical infrastructure sectors including chemical, financial, manufacturing, media, and transportation. As of today, the forum has 44 members in total. It was groundbreaking for Japanese industry to create a cross-sector cooperative framework on their own voluntarily to influence policy and share best practices rather than waiting for instructions from the government. Still, the forum members initially faced difficulties in having frank and open discussions between different critical infrastructure sectors due to their different business culture before they build trust over many face-to-face meetings and after-work drinks. The forum first had to define what cybersecurity professionals and their missions mean to end-user companies. Since all the members have a global business presence and one-fourth of them are Tokyo 2020 sponsors, the members agreed to adopt a global common language rather than a domestic one, so that they can bring back their findings to their subsidiaries outside Japan. Thus, the forum began looking for a global cybersecurity standard for the protection of critical infrastructure and found the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework. Because the Japanese Information-Technology Promotion Agency (IPA) published a Japanese translated version in May 2014, it became easier for the Japanese forum members to understand the framework to have a holistic picture to map what cybersecurity missions end users should pursue. NICE Framework: For In-house Cyberscurity The forum had to overcome another challenge due to their unique business culture. Under the lifetime employment system, major Japanese companies traditionally rotate their employees every two to three years. This helps employees understand the whole picture of the company business but makes it difficult to maintain cybersecurity expertise and keep up with ever-growing cybersecurity issues. Only 28% of IT professionals work in-house in Japan, whereas 65% do so in the US and 54% in the UK. Japanese end-user companies tend to outsource most IT and cybersecurity work to system integrators and vendors. The outsourcing culture made the forum pick another global standard, the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Framework to define skills, which Japanese end user companies typically outsource, such as digital forensics to fulfill their missions. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework was used to map missions for in- house cybersecurity positions. The forum has published a chart to map different types of cybersecurity jobs from Chief Information Security Officer and auditors to hands-on technical people such as Security Operation Center people and Help Desk, and shows how deep technical knowledge is needed to do their job. Another chart defines what kind of skillsets are needed for so-called operational technology (OT) people, who specialise in industrial control systems for critical infrastructure, based on NIST 800-53 Rev. 5 (draft): Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations. NISC: For Policymakers and Educators The forum members also reached out to the Japanese government and universities to incorporate industry\u2019s efforts to cultivate cybersecurity professionals into policy- making and education. The National center of Incident readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity (NISC), which is responsible to make national cybersecurity strategy and policy, as well as the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry invites the forum to their strategy committee meetings and ask the forum to share their findings. Japanese national strategies refer to the Cross-Sector Forum, introducing their definition of cybersecurity professionals. Furthermore, some of the forum members fund universities to create a cybersecurity course and send their employees as lecturers to share their first-hand knowledge to detect, analyze, and response to cyberattacks. Efforts the forum makes are not just limited to Japan. They participate in international conferences such as ones hosted by NIST to share how the Cross-Sector Forum uniquely utilizes the NIST and NICE Frameworks to define cybersecurity missions and professionals. Since some members have the market in Southeast Asia, they are actively involved in cybersecurity capacity-building. For example, one of the forum members provided train of trainers for a national Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) so that the CERT can conduct further training for local critical infrastructure companies. Another member hosted a number of cyber exercises and incident response training for ASEAN countries. Their journey to define cybersecurity missions and talents has helped the Cross- Sector Forum better communicate with the international cybersecurity community because they are now equipped with a global common language. This also allows the forum to share their learnings to adopt global standards and contribute to capacity- building domestically and internationally. Because ASEAN is now expanding its investments in cybersecurity capacity-building, the forum\u2019s projects are topical and relevant to ASEAN countries. It is the time for Japanese industry to offer its insights to the region and contribute to better cyber resiliency in the world."

    "title": "Global Health Security: COVID-19 & Its Impacts Lockdowns in ASEAN: Winning the Pandemic War",
    "author(s)": "By Jose M.L. Montesclaros",
    "date": "No. 033 \u2013 22 February 2021",
    "content": "AT THE beginning of the pandemic in February 2020, lockdowns were seen as a last resort, and even discouraged by the World Health Organisation (WHO). A year since the pandemic outbreak, the ASEAN region is still struggling with a growth in infections of more than five per cent over the past week, adding up to 2.2 million cases today, and more than 47,000 deaths (as of 10 February 2021). Lockdowns are still important today. While over nine types of COVID-19 vaccines have already been developed, it will take time to expand production and to roll these out, with only two billion doses of the vaccines projected by the end of 2021; this leaves practically the remaining three-fourths of the world waiting. In fact, there are fears it may take until 2024 until the vaccines reach the poorest countries. Dire States: Where Lockdowns Are Critical The temptation is to wait for the vaccines to finish rolling out, and to not take action in addressing the pandemic now. This is because the clock for COVID-19 infections and deaths continues to tick on a daily basis in over 221 countries, territories and cruise ships. It is also uncertain if new vaccines will be just as effective as in their original tests, against the mutated versions of the pandemic. For these, only time will tell. Lockdowns are still needed, because COVID-19 is primarily an urban disease- management problem. It thrives and grows exponentially within densely populated geographical areas, given the millions of person-to-person interactions occurring daily, whether in offices, entertainment or dining areas, on the streets, or in public transport. With every day that passes, where an effective lockdown is not implemented, the exponential growth in infections is expected to continue. COVID-19 is feared because of the risk of death. COVID-19 infection is not a death knell, however, since it has lower mortality risks than diseases like tuberculosis, or even the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). With only three per cent of cases resulting in deaths, the key reason for the large number of deaths out of more than 100 million cases is insufficient access to treatment at the local level. The management of local resources, is thus a key determinant of deaths. Each state has its own maximum healthcare capacity, which is the combination of the infrastructure to provide due treatment, and the sufficiency of support to subsidise treatments, especially to poorer populace. Thus, a telltale sign that a country has exceeded the maximum number of individuals that the state\u2019s healthcare capacity (both infrastructure and financial support) can accommodate is when deaths for every COVID-19 case are highest. Currently, the situation in Indonesia, the Philippines and Myanmar is the most dire, with approximately 27, 21 and 22 deaths for every 1,000 cases, respectively. Making up two-thirds of the region\u2019s population, these are pulling up the average deaths in ASEAN to 21 deaths for every 1,000 cases. It is in these areas, where lockdowns are most needed. Launching Effective \u201cCity-Level\u201d Lockdowns While some may consider lockdowns to be an impossible economic burden, it is important to highlight that effective lockdowns at the city- or subnational-level have allowed for arresting exponential growth in cases within a two-month period, learning from Singapore and China. In both cases, the lockdown allowed for the number of active cases (total cases minus recoveries/deaths) to fall; this means the number of new infections per day were slower than (which takes about 14 days per person) the growth in the number of new infections occurring. These can serve as learning points for other countries, to improve the way they have executed their lockdowns, learning from the past year. First, these countries implemented strict movement control policies. Singapore is an island-state connected physically to Malaysia via a causeway, so this route was practically shut. Wuhan City is surrounded by other towns in Hubei Province, China, making it more challenging to close off. Yet, strict movement controls within, into and out of cities were implemented from late January/early February until early April 2020. Wuhan citizens needed clearance just to leave their homes, and all non-essential companies (including manufacturing plants), as well as schools, continued to be closed down, and road travel was also locked off and controlled across Hubei Province, minimising non-essential travel within the city, as well as into and out of it. This required a \u201cwar-time\u201d level of re-alignment and deployment of manpower, to actively monitor the movements of people at the time of COVID-19. In Wuhan\u2019s and Singapore\u2019s case, support of contact-tracing technologies was, and is still being used. Crucial Role of Financial Support & Economic Security The coup de gr\u00e2ce, which differentiates these countries from the rest, was their provision of financial support to maintain the economic security of individuals amid lockdowns. Singapore leveraged approximately SGD100 billion (or 20% of its annual GDP) of its large fiscal reserves (at least SGD800 billion), providing individuals with guarantees of economic security by ensuring sufficient wages even as citizens stayed indoors, during its lockdown from early April until end-May, 2020 when its \u201ccircuit-breaker\u201d (lockdown) was lifted. Lockdowns remain a critical priority today, and for some countries, the capacity to treat the continuously growing infections has already clearly been exceeded. In these cases, the option to wait for vaccines to roll out globally, entails a clear trade-off in the form of lives lost. Learning from the past year, imposing more effective lockdowns, with stricter controls and due support to the economic security of individuals, should be treated as a crucial necessity."

    "author(s)": "By Anu Anwar",
    "date": "No. 066 \u2013 8 April 2020",
    "content": "COVID-19 HAS now spread over 190 countries across all continents, except Antarctica, and has been classified as a global pandemic. This novel coronavirus has created the direst public-health crisis in generations, forcing lockdowns of countries, disrupting the global economy and restricting travel \u2014 all in just a few months since the disease began to spread outside of China. As countries are struggling to prevent a similar outbreak, analysing China's response could show the world a path to follow. China's response is particularly relevant at a time when Beijing is placing emphasis on the superiority of the \"China model\" that prioritises government control over individual freedoms. Such a model has become more evident in the era of President Xi Jinping. Xi Jinping and Deng Xiaoping In contrast to paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's \"hide and bide\" doctrine \u2014 which essentially means waiting for the right time and not taking the leading role \u2014 Chairman Xi portrays China as a global power that is willing to lead the world with Chinese solutions (\u4e2d\u56fd\u65b9\u6848 - Zhongguo Fang'an), an alternative development model to western-style democracy. Therefore, the world is watching China's moves very closely as the situation evolves, including with regard to the latest episode of COVID-19. This pandemic reveals the remarkable dynamics of China's governing system. China has been rebuked for its intolerance of dissidents, suppression of truth and controlling of information. Nevertheless, this pandemic has also revealed the strength of the Chinese system in mobilising resources and capabilities at an unprecedented level, in a way that is needed to rein in the virus. Experts opined that to tackle a pandemic, the best solution is to share information with the public and take swift measures on the eve of the outbreak. In the Chinese style of governance, the decision is made via a top-down approach. Wuhan & China\u2019s Top-down Approach At the earlier stage of the outbreak, Wuhan local government reported the presence of a SARS-like virus to the relevant department, but the higher authorities decided not to make the information public as an important annual political programme known as \"two sessions\" was due soon. Despite the urgency to save thousands of lives, the local government was not allowed to disclose such sensitive information without the authorisation of the central government. Furthermore, China's giant, opaque bureaucracy slowed the back and forth of communication between provincial and central governments. Ultimately, the Chinese system failed to take any substantial measures after a month since the first case was reported, as early as mid-November. Wuhan is a city of 11 million people \u2014 a population larger than that of Greece or Portugal, and centrally located in Hubei province, which is the gateway for China's rail, road, and waterways. The outbreak happened on the eve of the Chinese New Year \u2014 an event that leads to the world's largest annual human migration when Chinese people travel to visit their family and friends during this auspicious celebration. The news agencies reported that almost five million Wuhan residents travelled out of Wuhan before the lockdown, some even abroad. Consequently, long before even knowing of the existence of the virus, it is possible that many carriers spread it all over China and other parts of the world. A study conducted by the University of Southampton shows that if Chinese authorities had acted three weeks earlier than they did, the number of coronavirus cases could have been reduced by 95% and its geographic spread limited. Case of Dr Li Wenliang A doctor in Wuhan in his 30s shared the presence of an unknown disease with his colleagues via a WeChat group. China's digital surveillance system did not take long to detect the doctor's message and brought it to the notice of the authorities. Soon after, police arrested Dr Li Wenliang for allegedly spreading rumours and forced him to sign a letter denouncing himself for doing so. He was released soon after, but COVID-19 had become a reality by then. The doctor himself was infected and did not survive the virus. His death, and the unfair treatment he received for a warning that could have potentially saved thousands of lives, led to a wave of protests in Chinese social media. Despite the tight digital surveillance, the public outcry over Dr Li's death went viral as millions of Chinese netizens from all walks of life posted this quote \u2014\"A healthy society should not have only one voice.\" 'People\u2019s War': China Model Against Pandemics? This crisis posed an unprecedented challenge to the Chinese authorities and forced the ruling Communist Party to take draconian measures. The gravity of the pandemic was later recognised by the high command of the party leadership, who sought to make all-out efforts to contain the spread, designating their efforts as a \"people's war\". Soon after, hundreds of millions of people were put under lockdown for weeks, hospitals were built within a few weeks, the military was deployed, party cadres were mobilised at the grassroot levels, several local officials were sacked for their negligence and medical supplies were sourced on an emergency basis. The pandemic has now hit Europe, North America, Asia and beyond, but this public health crisis has also revealed the shortfall of western governance in replicating the China-style measures, however drastic and draconian, that have been identified by the WHO as a model to tackle this pandemic. China, due to the centrally-controlled one-party state, was able to implement such measures effectively. As a result, new cases are declining drastically in contrast to many parts of the world. However, one question remains \u2014 would the world even be facing this crisis if China had allowed the free flow of information and taken action at the beginning?"

    "content": "THE GEOPOLITICAL tensions in the South China Sea are simmering once again, after a lull following China\u2019s apparent strategy to lie low. ASEAN has been persuaded to pursue negotiations for a code of conduct and there is no chance for a sudden flip by the ASEAN side given the exceptional relations Beijing has developed with the Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen. There are several reasons why the tensions in the South China Sea may flare up into low-level naval skirmishes between China and ASEAN member states with overlapping claims, namely Vietnam and the Philippines, and lately Malaysia. Even Indonesia, a non-claimant, has been drawn into the fray. This worrying development is likely to be caused primarily by China\u2019s unrelentingly assertive military posture driven by rising nationalism. Latest Flare-Up China has been sending its well-armed Coast Guard vessels to escort its fishing fleet very close to the shores of Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia, challenging the latter\u2019s legitimate activities. The intrusion has resulted in deliberate ramming and sinking of fishing vessels from Vietnam and the Philippines. Ruffled by the presence of more than 100 fishing vessels from China off Thitu or Pag- asa, in the Tagalog language, which is the second largest \u201cisland\u201d in the Spratlys and where the Philippines has a military presence since 1978, Manila raised the alarm with China in July 2019. President Duterte chose to play down the issue. Early this year, following a protest note, Indonesia rushed six warships and four F-16 fighter jets to the Natuna Sea to counter intrusion by 60 Chinese fishing vessels, escorted by two Chinese Coast Guard vessels. The showdown was defused after the Chinese vessels left the area, which is reputedly rich in natural gas deposits and fish. Jakarta has since reinforced its military presence on the Natuna Islands which it owns so as to deter future intrusions. Separately, an ongoing three-month stand-off between Chinese survey vessels, always accompanied by the Chinese Coast Guard, and Malaysian vessels belonging to Malaysia\u2019s enforcement agencies in Luconia Shoals, where Malaysia produces oil and gas since the 1970s, is an unfriendly act. It is beyond what China can legitimately claim as exercising the freedom of navigation under international law. An incident happened two weeks ago, reportedly on 18 April, when Haiyang Dizhi 8, a Chinese government survey vessel that has been operating in Vietnamese and Philippine waters, was spotted trailing West Capella, a drilling vessel on contract to Petronas, the National Oil Company of Malaysia, in the same location. The seven Chinese Coast Guard vessels have since left the area. Nevertheless, the incident has drawn some sharp criticisms from netizens and the media.

    "content": "ON 24 JUNE 2020, Singapore's Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) issued final approval to Singtel and a StarHub-M1 joint venture to deploy 5G telecommunications networks across the island. TPG Telecom, a newer player, was awarded the remaining frequency to implement localised 5G networks. Core equipment partners were also announced, with Singtel choosing Sweden's Ericsson and the StarHub-M1 joint venture picking Finland's Nokia for its nationwide 5G networks. TPG Telecom will be partnering China's Huawei for its localised 5G networks. This has raised eyebrows in some quarters, with speculation that Huawei is being \"frozen out\" on account of security concerns. Not a \u2018Freeze Out\u2019 Some Western media reports have glossed over the Singapore government's clarification that the telcos were free to choose equipment providers, and have instead been quick to frame the situation in triumphalist terms. Decisions to go with Ericsson or Nokia are now being seen as supporting a US-led push to promote \"clean telcos\" and shut Huawei out of the 5G game. The reality in Singapore may well be more prosaic \u2013 that Huawei may have been an outside contender from the start, given the telcos' longstanding partnerships with European equipment providers. For example, Singtel and Ericsson's collaboration on 5G dates back to 2017 and the two companies worked together on deploying 4G networks previously as well. In a similar vein, Nokia partnered M1 in 2018 for its first 5G small cell trial in South-east Asia. IMDA's efforts to nurture 5G infrastructure highlight its desire to ensure a plurality of companies developing interoperable solutions. Avoiding over-reliance on a single point of failure is a reasonable and widely accepted risk mitigation strategy given the criticality of telecommunications infrastructure. This is further emphasised by how Singapore's telcos will draw on vendors other than their chosen equipment partners to build out specific parts of their 5G networks, a process that will likely include Huawei given its market share. Unpacking Sino-US Competition over 5G The global roll-out of 5G networks has become a proxy battleground for tensions between China and the United States amid an atmosphere of heightened \"techno- nationalism\u201d. As technology and digitalisation become intrinsically linked with prospects for unlocking economic value and securing growth, both China and the United States have paid closer attention to their technology supply chains as well as associated flows of investments and talent. The result of this scrutiny is an increasingly zero-sum dynamic, with the Trump administration demonstrating a willingness to push back directly against what it sees as longstanding unfair behaviour by China. In the case of 5G, the Trump administration has accused Huawei of racketeering and theft of intellectual property. In its overtures to allies encouraging them to spurn Huawei, the US has emphasised a need to secure 5G networks from surveillance, pointing to China's 2017 National Intelligence Law that can be used to compel telcos like Huawei to hand over data to the government. Lingering Doubts? China has yet to convincingly refute this and doubts will remain over how entangled Chinese technology companies' commercial interests are with the government's political agenda. But the fact is that no country is above surveillance when given the opportunity to further its national interests. As Chinese officials have pointed out, America's notion of \"trusted\" 5G vendors also rings hollow, given the Edward Snowden revelations and other surveillance disclosures such as the Crypto AG scandal. China's response is now extending beyond rhetoric. Article 24 in Beijing's draft Data towards countries adopting Security Law permits \"corresponding measures\" \"discriminatory prohibitions, limitations or other such measures\u2026 with respect to investment or trade related to data, data development and use, or technology\". This is likely a response to the Trump administration going for the jugular by cutting Huawei's access to American semiconductor foundries supplying the chips powering its equipment. Pragmatism, not 'Techno-Nationalism' Recent events might suggest the beginnings of a successful American \"containment\" of Huawei, but in South-east Asia, pragmatism is finding greater currency over \"techno-nationalism\u201d. For example, while Thailand's largest mobile operator AIS appears to have Huawei as a key player of its 5G roll-out, it has also signed agreements with Nokia and ZTE to develop use cases for 5G across a range of industrial applications. Malaysia sought diversity as well by seeking expertise from China and Japan, although its 5G roll-out has been complicated by a reversal of spectrum allocation due to allegedly improper procedure and allegations of corruption. The region's outlier, however, is Vietnam, with state-owned Viettel developing its own 5G hardware and software for roll-out by mid-2021. However, it remains to be seen whether Vietnam's effort lives up to its promise or whether these are actually localised 5G protocols played up by local sources. Technological Cold War? Nevertheless, a broader \"decoupling\" between China and the US will harm the economic and social potential of the next wave of general-purpose technologies. A technological cold war will likely see the creation of competing technology stacks lacking interoperability in the coming years. Beyond 5G, this new \"Great Game\" will likely play out in other emerging general- purpose technologies such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing. We can expect greater contestation over supply chains, investments, technical talent and even the reach of individual software applications. At the same time, Chinese technology companies will continue to expand their footprint while countries make pragmatic calculations based as much on cost as on security. This dynamic is already evident in South-east Asia. For example, Alibaba's cloud computing arm headquartered in Singapore has outpaced global leader Amazon Web Services in South-east Asia even though it entered the market only in 2015. One reason for its success is a willingness to offer countries localisation and base infrastructure in the region. Huawei is a target, but perhaps one of the easier targets in the US effort to thwart China's technological advancement. This Great Game will encompass much more than one company and one form of communications technology. It will also be about supply chains, software, and even about the effect and influence of dominant apps (think TikTok). So what is going on is not just about Huawei \u2013 it might really be about everything. Tough Binary Choices Ahead These are still early days. If American efforts to thwart the growth of Chinese technology companies take on a more punitive character, countries may be forced to make difficult binary choices. However, the extent to which the US can force other countries to rethink involvement with Chinese technology is not yet clear. 5G enables connectivity at higher speeds for the burgeoning Internet of Things and for smart city infrastructure. In Singapore, numerous collaborations and innovations with partners have been ongoing for some time. Last year, Huawei opened a new artificial intelligence (AI) lab in the Southeast Asian state which will, it is understood, feature space for test-bedding a wide range of 5G applications, also contributing to the AI talent ecosystem in the coming years. Huawei also plans to make its cloud services business centre \u2013 launched here last year \u2013 among its largest outside China, serving industries and governments, including, as Huawei has been keen to point out, clients in Singapore's government. Implications for Singapore Besides these, Chinese technology is involved in AI research and development projects in areas ranging from autonomous vehicles to smart university campuses. These are set to continue and be strengthened in the years to come. Key players in this will not just be Huawei but Chinese players such as Alibaba, which launched a global AI research facility in Singapore in 2018, in partnership with Nanyang Technological University (NTU), and AI company SenseTime, which launched a talent programme (also with NTU) to nurture AI researchers in 2019. Singapore's approach to weather techno-nationalism will likely continue to be defined by pragmatism that seeks to maintain a dynamic equilibrium with the US and China. Its leaders have consistently counselled against a zero-sum mindset and regularly reiterate the case for not being forced to choose a side. However, so monochromatic have views become elsewhere that even this notion of a measured approach has come in for criticism. There is no guarantee that the next US administration \u2013 whatever its political orientation \u2013 will ameliorate this position, and the notion of choosing a side will undoubtedly be revisited across a range of issues as China and the US continue their contestation. China, too, will increasingly flex its muscles to protect its interests. Big powers may in time attempt to exercise their clout further and force smaller nations such as Singapore to choose \"their\" side on a whole range of issues. But if these nations are indeed brought to that point, there may be more than a few surprises in store when it comes to how the chips eventually come down."

    "author(s)": "By Kyler Ong",
    "date": "No. 008 \u2013 10 January 2020",
    "content": "ACCORDING TO the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) and IHS Markit, IS orchestrated between 41-76 alleged chemical attacks, mostly involving chlorine and sulphur mustard, in Iraq and Syria between 2014-2017 at the height of its operations. Unprecedented in scale then, it was also likely the first time an Islamist terrorist group had successfully assembled and deployed chemical payloads on projectiles. CBRN attacks still constitute a terrorism risk in Southeast Asia and beyond. In 2017, Indonesian authorities foiled a plan by a pro-IS Jamaat Ansharud Daulah (JAD) cell to build a radiological dispersal device with uranium-233. In the same year, two IS-linked brothers attempted to use hydrogen sulphide in a foiled attack in Australia. A year later, European authorities disrupted three bio-terror plots by alleged IS-linked elements involving the use of ricin and anthrax. And this October, Indonesian authorities again foiled a suicide attack plot by IS elements using abrin-filled explosives. Intent, Capability and Opportunity In counter-terrorism, threat calculations are usually based on the traditional Intent, Capability and Opportunity triad framework. Notwithstanding the absence of any chemical attack claims, IS has justified the use of CBRN weapons in its propaganda materials. The launch of a bio-terror campaign by a pro-IS media outlet, al-Abd al- Faqir Media, in July and August 2018 respectively, is one of the more recent expressions of this continued intent. Terrorists\u2019 capacity to develop CBRN weapons is dictated by factors such as access to expertise, materials, funding and infrastructure. According to EUROPOL reports, returning IS-linked foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs) from Iraq and Syria, who have developed capabilities in handling explosives, including chemical weapons, may seek to export their expertise to other conflict theatres as IS adopts a decentralised, global insurgency model. Likewise, the increased exploitation of social media by the group has also facilitated the cross-border diffusion of CBRN know-how. Advances in new technologies, including in genetic engineering, could also make it easier for terrorists to develop homemade biological weapons. The relative ease of access to dual-use agents (e.g., chlorine) that can be weaponised also poses a security challenge. The same holds true for some bio-toxins that could be harvested from commercially available plants. For example, castor beans found to be used to produce ricin in a 2018 bomb plot in Cologne, Germany, had been purchased online. Further, although there are questions about IS\u2019 financial resources to fund potential CBRN programmes globally, the group has proved resilient and adaptive and may seek alternate means to raise funds, including through cyber-financing. Pockets of the world inundated with chaos also metastasise the risk of terrorist access"

    "title": "Whitsun Reef Incident: Duterte\u2019s China Strategy Sinking?",
    "author(s)": "By Julius Cesar Trajano",
    "date": "No. 063 \u2013 19 April 2021",
    "content": "THE PHILIPPINES has strongly condemned the swarming of hundreds of alleged China\u2019s militia boats in the Whitsun Reef, a contested part of the South China Sea that Manila claims to be within its exclusive economic zone. Whitsun Reef itself, which is part of the Union Banks, is claimed by China, the Philippines and Vietnam. The Whitsun Reef incident raised concern that the overwhelming presence of Chinese maritime militia would be a prelude to taking de facto control by China, similar to what it did in the Mischief Reef in 1995 and Scarborough Shoal in 2012. Meanwhile, the Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila has issued almost daily diplomatic protests to the Chinese embassy demanding that China promptly withdraw its fishing vessels and maritime assets in the Philippine-claimed features in the Spratlys, and to direct its fishing vessels to desist from environmentally destructive activities. It even summoned the Chinese envoy to Manila on 13 April, the first time since the start of the Duterte presidency in 2016, to express the Philippines\u2019 utmost displeasure over the lingering presence of Chinese militia boats. Duterte\u2019s Failing Strategy? This recent development vividly demonstrates that the strategy of President Rodrigo Duterte to avoid confronting China and getting closer with Beijing at the expense of its security alliance with the United States has not changed the way China behaves vis- \u00e0-vis Philippine-claimed territories in the South China Sea. There have been no changes in China\u2019s behaviour, at the expense of Filipino fishermen, whose right to conduct fishing in the South China Sea was upheld by the Arbitral Ruling in 2016 at The Hague. It must be noted that the massive deployment of Chinese fishing boats, reported to be part of the maritime militia, is not something new and has been for many years a strategy of China. It is therefore na\u00efve for Duterte to assume that this strategy would be reversed merely because he chose to be a good friend of Beijing. Now that the Philippine election season is about to start leading to the 2022 national elections that will mark the end of Duterte\u2019s term, the Philippines going back to a more popular confrontational stance towards Beijing should be expected. The race to replace Duterte would include delivering anti-China rhetoric by potential candidates and even by his closest political allies and cabinet members. Duterte did this too in 2016 and it worked. Now that the appeasement strategy is quickly sinking, Duterte himself should now publicly voice out the Philippines\u2019 demand for the withdrawal of Chinese ships, instead of merely relying on statements from his defence and foreign affairs secretaries, to send a strong message to Beijing and the international community. What Can Manila Do Now? One solid option for the Philippines is to fully re-embrace its security alliance with the US and must never give it up. Since the issue erupted, US Secretaries of Defence and State Department together with US National Security Adviser have conducted phone calls with their Philippine counterparts several times. American officials reiterated that the Mutual Defence Treaty (MDT) will be invoked if China attacks Philippine public ships, aircrafts and troops in the South China Sea. The PHL-US military exercises were also resumed on 12 April, in an apparent message to China. The initiatives of both the US and the Philippines to find ways to enhance the treaty and the Visiting Forces Agreement should be seen as a response to the failure of the appeasement strategy by Duterte. Foreign Affairs Secretary Teddy Locsin Jr just said that he wanted the MDT to be amended to include any Chinese attack on civilian vessels, not just public/military vessels, from the Philippines. In addition, the Philippines should also now reconsider to conduct joint maritime patrols with the US in the South China Sea as a testament of their iron-clad alliance. And this can be further complemented with multinational freedom of navigation patrols with other regional and extra-regional navies. Other Options There are other options that the Philippines can do while strengthening its alliance with the US. Manila can highlight the marine environmental consequences of the swarming of maritime militia in reefs, illicit harvesting of marine life and overfishing. This can boost Manila\u2019s campaign for international support to pressure Beijing. This should come with strong assertion of the 2016 Arbitral Ruling which found that China\u2019s artificial islands and rampant harmful fishing activities violated UNCLOS\u2019 environmental protection obligations. Moving the marine environment of the South China Sea may also be used by Manila as a rallying point for constructive collaboration among claimant states, including China, in the future, given that this was highly recommended by the Ruling. forward, protecting The Philippines can consider the resumption of its long-delayed oil exploration activities within its exclusive economic zone, of course with the protection from its coast guard, navy and air force, to clearly demonstrate that it asserts the implementation of the Arbitral Ruling which it won. But commercial exploration agreements jointly with other claimants should also be considered as a way forward. This should also be coupled with strong encouragement from the government for Filipino fishermen to assert the country\u2019s sovereign right to fishing. The presence of legitimate fishermen from the Philippines facing a huge flotilla of foreign maritime militia posing as fishers in its own exclusive economic zone would always convey a strong moral message for international support. Seeking a Shared Stance Definitely, utilising ASEAN mechanisms to collectively engage China on the recent source of tension in the South China Sea should always be in the primary bag of diplomatic strategies of the Philippines. Apart from the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea negotiations, the Philippines can also directly consult and collaborate with other Southeast Asian claimants Malaysia, Vietnam and Brunei. They can consider joint patrols as well as finding ways to manage and eventually, as recently suggested by former Philippine Supreme Court justice Antonio Carpio, to voluntarily settle their territorial disputes, in order to project a shared stance. But these multiple pathways all depend on whether Duterte would change his strategy towards the South China Sea. Otherwise, it would be up to the Filipino electorate in mid-2022, as they choose his replacement, to push for a different tack."

    "title": "Germany\u2019s Indo-Pacific Strategy: Can Berlin Contribute?",
    "author(s)": "By Frederick Kliem",
    "date": "No. 169 \u2013 10 September 2020",
    "content": "GERMANY RECENTLY joined a very exclusive club of only a handful of states with an official Indo-Pacific strategy (IPS), albeit euphemistically called Leitlinien (guidelines) in German. The paper symbolised a sea change in traditional German foreign policy amidst a growing realisation that Berlin can no longer rely on the United States alone to provide global public goods. While many in the governing party, CDU, had long called for more global responsibility, including military deployments, the junior coalition partner has now come around, too. The document is a potential herald of a more robust line towards China\u2019s global heft, albeit with some caveats. Germany\u2019s Holistic Approach Germany is the least capable and relevant power to have produced an Indo-Pacific strategy. Yet, Berlin\u2019s 68-page document is the most comprehensive and detailed of all governments that have pronounced on the concept. This is emblematic of Germany\u2019s holistic approach to international relations, a complex policy mix of developmental assistance, diplomacy and multilateralism, and military deployments, in that order. Additionally, Berlin is mindful of European sensitivities regarding German power and always careful to embed its foreign and security policy within the European Union framework. Nonetheless, the German Indo-Pacific strategy unambiguously promises greater responsibility and engagement in Asia, including intensified military cooperation and deployments, regional increased defence diplomacy and participation multilateralism, specifically ASEAN-led forums. in And it is an astonishing, albeit somewhat camouflaged condemnation of increasing Chinese assertiveness through frequent (46 times!) references to the so-called rules- based order and openly questioning Beijing\u2019s commitment to the status quo. At the same time, the paper also indirectly criticises the forceful US approach, recognising that increasing strategic great power competition is not in Germany\u2019s interest. Instead of unambiguously backing the transatlantic ally, Berlin identifies a need for greater diversification of partnerships in the region. Germany\u2019s New Normative Resolve As a manufacturing and trading nation, Germany\u2019s interests are obvious. China is the largest trading partner in goods, Asia the largest non-EU export region, and Germany\u2019s economy depends on reliable supply chains and open sea lanes. This encouraged state-backed Chinese commentators to argue that the German Indo- Pacific strategy had business rather than strategic security in mind, and Berlin may only pay lip-service to US-led efforts to check Chinese ambitions. This observation is only partly correct. Unlike France, the traditional German approach to China and Russia was always one of reaping optimal economic benefits while remaining quiet on sensitive issues. This brought economic rewards but invited criticism. But things are different now. Chinese commentators may underestimate the remarkable transformation of German foreign policy currently under way as well as Germany\u2019s new normative resolve. Looking Beyond Europe Germany is now prepared to acknowledge that it has strategic national interests beyond Europe, and Berlin seems prepared to pursue those more robustly than ever before. Indeed, it was only COVID-19 that prevented the deployment of a German frigate to the Indo-Pacific this year. Also Foreign Minister Heiko Maas overtly rebuffed his Chinese counterpart\u2019s advances on a recent Berlin visit, affirming that Germany is unwilling to accept current Chinese assertiveness. It is also clear that certain elements of Chinese and also Russian statecraft are of serious concern in Berlin for normative, not business reasons. For example, Germany is currently engaging in a diplomatic spat with Russia, openly accusing them of poisoning the opposition politician Alexei Navalny, who has since been transported to Germany for treatment. A test case for this normative resolve will be the pending German decision to cancel the Russian-German gas pipeline Nord Stream-2 over the Navalny incident. China should pay attention to the outcome of this. From Rhetoric to Action? While all this points to a generally more assertive and self-confident Germany in the future, caveats must be added. A meaningful strategy must include three essential components: ends, means, and resources. While ends and means are fairly well described in the German Indo-Pacific strategy, resources are lacking \u2013 material and ideological. First, the gap between Berlin\u2019s security rhetoric and action is huge. The ailments of the German military are well documented. Serious underfinancing and poor political management have left the Bundeswehr with a serious capability gap, and, as the same Chinese commentator correctly explains, overconfidence in normative soft power has crippled power projection capability. Furthermore, there is a deep gap between a generally anti-militaristic, sceptical German public and the aspirations of more forward-leaning foreign policy elites. Thus far, Berlin has failed to explain to the taxpayer why the country has security interests in far-flung regions. Lastly, Berlin\u2019s Indo-Pacific strategy relies partly on multilateralism, greater trade- interdependence and participation in ASEAN-led forums. While more free trade agreements (FTAs) are possible, increased German and/or EU representation at ASEAN-led forums is unlikely at this point. Can Germany Contribute? Hence, how much Germany will be able to contribute de facto on the ground remains an open question. Either way, Berlin\u2019s contribution alone can only be a drop in the ocean, at best. This is why greater European cooperation is important. But an EU solution requires genuine consensus on China, and EU processes for military cooperation are complex and limited. While the German Indo-Pacific strategy may well lead the way for an eventual joint EU Indo-Pacific strategy, for the time being, intramural minilateralism may be the best way forward. French and British Indo-Pacific interests largely align with Germany\u2019s and in confluence the \u201cBig E-3\u201d have the capacity to be more forceful in the region. Granted, there is Brexit and a difficult Macron-Merkel relationship. But the post-1945 Franco-German relationship has demonstrated an enduring partnership, as was the case with the recent EU COVID-19 stimulus package. Current British Indo-Pacific engagement shows that despite substantial assets, foreign and security policy is less effective in absence of a well-defined strategy. The clear and detailed German Indo-Pacific is a great start, albeit a toothless one for now. But it streamlines a whole-of-government effort to contribute to Indo-Pacific stability, and it can be a blueprint for a cooperative European approach \u2013 minilateral at first and EU-wide later."

    "title": "Global Health Security: COVID-19 & Its Impacts Price of Pandemic: Weakened Trade System Exposed",
    "author(s)": "By Evan Rogerson",
    "date": "No. 083 \u2013 4 May 2020",
    "content": "2020 WAS never going to be a good year for global trade. At the beginning of the year forecasts for trade growth were largely downbeat. The United States-China trade confrontation was having a chilling effect that the limited truce announced in the \u201cPhase 1\u201d agreement did little to counter. Supply chains, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, were destabilised and businesses were facing an uncertain investment climate. The outlook overall was characterised by anxiety, to which the unpredictable policy environment was a major contributing factor. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has quickly made all previous forecasts look optimistic. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) estimates that trade volumes could fall between 13% and 32% this year. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts the worst economic slump since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The simultaneous shrinkage of supply and demand, with business closures and soaring unemployment, have forced governments to jettison economic orthodoxy in favour of massive monetary and fiscal intervention. Trade Prospects: From Grey to Black With the focus understandably on the domestic front, trade measures have often been ill-conceived and incoherent. This is not a sustainable situation. From the Depression of the 1930s to the US-China trade war, there is ample evidence that restricting trade not only restricts recovery but also makes existing problems worse. The immediate trade crisis has been the supply of medical and related material needed to treat patients and limit infection. The policy response, especially by the major economies, has been chaotic. Panicked internal market actions have been matched on the external trade side, with export restrictions expanding while many existing import barriers - like tariffs on soap - remain in place. There has been no effective global attempt at a cooperative and coherent response. The G20 Leaders\u2019 Declaration of 26 March 2020 was a recital of good intentions at a high level of generality. It is instructive, and depressing, to compare it with, for example, the 2011 Cannes G20 Declaration, which was much more substantive and operational. The G20 Trade Ministers\u2019 Statement of 30 March 2020 was similarly lacking in any operational content other than a commitment to notify measures to the WTO. This contrasts with the 15 April G20 Finance Ministers\u2019 communiqu\u00e9, which at least included an action plan. Weakened WTO Leadership: Enter the Smaller Players The multilateral trading system, as embodied in the WTO, has done no better. Aside from the trade forecast noted above, the organisational response has been limited to statements, some in conjunction with other international organisations, and reporting trade measures notified by members (less than half the measures taken have been notified). It took until 17 April for the WTO to hold a virtual meeting of government representatives, and this centred, incredibly, on procedural issues. Like the G20, the WTO did better in 2009, when then Director-General Pascal Lamy took the initiative to set up a pro-active system to monitor protectionist measures. In the absence of leadership from traditional quarters, a number of smaller and middle- sized economies have stepped up to set an example of international co-operation. Singapore and New Zealand have taken the lead. On 21 March they announced a joint commitment to maintain open and connected supply chains and refrain from the imposition of export controls or tariffs and non-tariff barriers. They also pledged to remove any existing trade restrictive measures on essential goods, especially medical supplies. Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile and Myanmar joined them on 25 March. Singapore and New Zealand gave formal effect to their commitments in a declaration tabled at the WTO on 15 April which they invited other WTO members to endorse. They have both specified the measures they are taking under the declaration. Food Security: G20 Talks, Others Act Next to the urgent need for medical supplies, another important trade concern has been maintaining access to food. The heads of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), World Health Organisation (WHO) and WTO have jointly warned about the potential negative impact of the pandemic on food security, especially for the poorest. While at present global stocks and availability are high, export restrictions remain a threat. On 21 April G20 agriculture ministers issued a Declaration which underlined the importance of keeping food supply chains open but otherwise added little to previous exhortations. The one specific commitment it contained was a reaffirmation of the agreement from Cannes in 2011 not to impose export restrictions on food supplies to the World Food Programme. The G20 leaders at Cannes also encouraged translating this into a WTO declaration by the 2011 Ministerial Conference. Yet some of the same G20 members, notably India, have blocked it at the WTO ever since, despite strenuous consensus- building efforts led by Singapore. As with medical supplies, it has been ad hoc groups of members who have taken the initiative in the WTO. On 22 April Canada circulated a statement in which it was joined by many of the big players in agricultural trade, including the US, European Union and Brazil, but not China. They have undertaken, inter alia, not to impose agriculture export restrictions; to refrain from implementing unjustified agricultural trade barriers; and to exercise restraint in establishing domestic food stocks of exportable products. There are weaknesses in this agreement (\u201cunjustified\u201d barriers, for example) but it is a significant step forward in policy co-operation nonetheless. Keeping Multilateral System Alive The multilateral trading system, like the G20, has been found wanting at the very moment it is most needed. This is largely because it has been seriously weakened over the past few years by the Trump administration. The US has not simply withdrawn from leadership in the WTO and other multilateral institutions, it has actively undermined them. Other powerful members have not filled the leadership vacuum and the WTO Secretariat\u2019s voice is muted. The activism of smaller economies, among whom Singapore stands out, is one of the few positive features of the current scene. Informal and issue-focused coalitions of concerned governments have been the way WTO negotiations have made any progress at all since the death of the Doha Round. While they cannot completely fill the gap left by the abdication of major players, they are also the best present hope for sustaining and renewing the system so it can play its much-needed part in recovery."

    "title": "Global Health Security Migrant Domestic Workers: Their COVID-19 Burdens",
    "author(s)": "By Margareth Sembiring",
    "date": "No. 055 \u2013 31 March 2020",
    "content": "COVID-19 HAS hit many countries and affected many different communities. Migrant workers have suffered considerable adversity from this pandemic. They are not paid for work done or they have lost their jobs without compensation. Many have been \u201clocked out\u201d as they could not return home when travel restrictions kicked in. Domestic workers have been particularly hard hit due to the nature of their work that often requires them to live in with their employers. The focus of governments on containment of COVID-19 has left migrant domestic workers largely unprotected from the adverse effects of the various measures introduced to safeguard the native population. The first relates to work environment and entitlements, and the second pertains to the loss of livelihood. Considering their human dignity and significant contribution to host and home countries\u2019 economies, it is important for governments to create balanced policies to ensure their protection while addressing public health concerns. Work Environment and Entitlements A recent survey in Hong Kong reports that up to 14 percent, or an estimate of more than 50,000 domestic workers, had not been equipped with adequate protective items like masks or hand sanitisers by their employers. This has raised concern given that domestic workers are often tasked to go out of the employers\u2019 homes to do grocery shopping and other errands. Thousands of free masks were eventually provided to the domestic workers by their respective countries\u2019 consular offices in Hong Kong. The same survey also found that more than 50 percent of respondents had borne increased cleaning chore and childcare workload as schools had been closed. Their health was further at risk since gloves or masks were not always provided for cleaning work. A breach of once-a-week rest-day entitlement was also reported with about 20 percent of respondents not given an off-day for a month. The Hong Kong Labour Department issued an appeal to foreign domestic workers to stay at home during their off-days to reduce the risk of transmission. Stressing that employers should not ask their domestic workers to work even if they are at home, the government essentially left it to both parties to reach mutual agreement. Balancing Entitlement & Transmission Concerns In its recent advisory to employers of foreign domestic workers in Singapore, the Ministry of Manpower has also recommended a stay-home arrangement for the off- days of the domestic workers. In Hong Kong, the migrant worker communities felt strongly that their entitlement was being violated. Although it is not strictly mandatory, the stay-home advice has created tension between employers and domestic workers. Employers fear that their domestic workers might contract the disease while going out on their rest days. This has led to cases of job termination to those who chose to exercise their off-day entitlement. Conversely, domestic workers were concerned about their own health when their employers were serving stay-home notice. Balancing domestic workers\u2019 needs to rest and mutual concerns over transmission risk is critical to ensure safe working and living environments for both employers and domestic workers. In this situation, employers need to consider arranging for alternative rest days if their workers must stay home on off-days and equip them with masks and hand sanitisers as and when necessary. Employment Loss Tension over off-day entitlement is not the only cause of job termination. The demand for domestic workers has shrunk either because employers were compelled to move out of the country or because the employers have lost their own jobs. The threat of unemployment due to decreasing demand is further exacerbated by travel restrictions. When the Philippines first imposed a travel ban to China that included Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan in February 2020, new and returning Filipino migrant workers who were in the country protested against the policy. Similar concerns have again arisen when the Philippine government placed the entire Luzon Island on \u201cenhanced community quarantine\u201d in mid-March. Around the same period, Indonesia temporarily suspended sending of migrant workers overseas. In these cases, migrant workers were left with little choice but to postpone or abandon their travel plans to commence or resume employment abroad. They face a real risk of losing their job opportunities. Now that COVID-19 has spread far and wide, more countries have tightened their borders, especially on incoming foreigners that include migrant workers. Singapore recently requires employers and employment agencies to get government approval before they can bring in either new or returning migrant domestic workers. Taiwan took a very similar measure, and Hong Kong has also started to bar entry to foreigners. The rapidly changing travel restrictions were often not communicated to migrant domestic workers in a timely manner, thus creating confusion and tension at borders. Travel restrictions have direct implications on migrant workers\u2019 economic security, threaten their livelihood, and risk them falling into poverty. The current experience shows an urgent need for policies that accommodate the concerns of migrant workers in times of crisis. Opportunity for Decent Package The scale of disruptions that the current public health crisis has brought to the world is unprecedented. It has sent governments scrambling for the most effective measures to contain the spread of the virus in their respective societies. In most cases, domestic workers have been affected disproportionately because of their more vulnerable position in the labour market. As the International Labour Organisation (ILO) has often emphasised in its reports, domestic work remains informal, performed outside of labour and social protection regulations. The domestic workers are least protected and they suffer from poor monitoring and implementation of existing laws. The situation may be temporary but affected migrant workers may not have enough resources to sustain themselves and their family members during this period. They seem to have to fend for themselves as the economic stimuli in host or home countries may not reach them either. There is an urgent need for governments and the ILO to seize the occasion to re-examine plans to integrate the migrant workers into the respective national policies. The evidence shows that migrant workers contribute instrumentally to home and host countries\u2019 economies. Domestic work is important as it provides for care of the elderly and the young while upholding family life conducive for the professional income earners. Human society wherever it exists will benefit from the productivity derived from the migrant workers. In this regard, giving the migrant workers the necessary protection in terms of access to a minimum level of health care, conducive work environment, and the prevailing national laws must be the decent package. It needs to be considered and addressed carefully for the long term as the battle against COVID-19 continues."

    "author(s)": "By Kenneth Yeo Yaoren and Iftekharul Bashar",
    "date": "No. 068 \u2013 13 April 2020",
    "content": "THE COVID-19 pandemic has brought an unprecedented threat to the health, livelihood and well-being of entire populations. While countries across the world continue to grapple with arguably the worst global health crisis in generations, terrorist networks of various denominations are looking to capitalise on ongoing uncertainties and insecurities to consolidate their operations and spread panic and hate. They blast online propaganda messages to followers and potential recruits by framing calamity as divine retribution. In what appears to be a new trend, White supremacists have even begun to talk about weaponising COVID-19 while sections of the Christian rightwing in the United States tried to defy quarantine orders. Weaponising COVID-19 Some have gone further, by inciting followers to launch attacks, particularly against soft targets such as hospitals and government installations. There have been reports of White supremacists planning to use the virus to achieve their deadly objectives. US federal authorities have been cited as disclosing that among the tactics talked about included using saliva on door handles and elevator buttons at government offices, and intermingling in public places \u201cwith the enemies\u201d to transmit the virus. Indeed, there is growing concern among US federal authorities of White supremacist terror. Capitalising on developments such as the COVID-19 pandemic comes straight out of the terrorist playbook by framing any natural disaster as God\u2019s will. The potential security implications warrant renewed vigilance on a global scale. This is even as governments face unprecedented health and economic challenges as the number of COVID-19 related cases and deaths skyrocket, and resources, including those of law enforcement and intelligence agencies, get stretched or diverted. Disturbing Methods White supremacist groups are touting accelerationist, siege and conspiracy theories linked to the COVID-19 pandemic to spread disinformation, sow panic and discontent and incite individuals to violence. Their messaging includes an array of conspiracy theories that play up anti-Semitic and xenophobic sentiments against, for example, China, its government and minority communities. More worryingly, US law enforcement agencies say, is the resort by some networks to use secure messaging apps such as Telegram to call for new attacks. Plans to use the coronavirus as a bioweapon against their enemies, including the FBI and non-white communities, have also been discussed. According to reports, White supremacists  are encouraging one another to deliberately spread the COVID-19 virus, if contracted, through bodily fluids and personal interactions. This includes through the use of aerosol spray bottles to disperse infected bodily fluids on police officers on the street as well as points of congregation such as markets, political offices, and places of worship. The methods of applying such biological attacks through the use of COVID-19 would appear far-fetched but are nonetheless disturbing. According to a SITE Intelligence report, a White supremacist in Missouri recently attempted to bomb a hospital, partly on the belief \u201cthe pandemic was engineered by Jews\u201d -- the attacker had in the leadup also posted conspiracy theories about COVID-19 and reposted others\u2019 call to infect doctors; this indicated that some individuals may be willing to act on such directives. Cultivating Forces Beyond mere narratives of retribution and divine punishment against their opponents, Islamist militant networks, on their part, have suggested practical ideas to their followers for dealing with the pandemic. These can often serve a dual purpose. For example, IS\u2019 call to followers to uphold hygiene standards and defer travels to Europe are also aimed at preserving their forces for attacks. Moreover, with finite government resources also redirected from military operations to address grave healthcare and economic challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, force projection at terrorist sanctuaries have been significantly reduced, including in terror hotspots such as Syria and Afghanistan. Capitalising on this, IS has attempted to grow its support base and resources, including through conducting recent jailbreaks in Afghanistan and Syria, where many jihadists remain in detention, to regain their forces. Overall, the reduced capacity of military campaigns, has provided IS networks with the time and space to retreat, recover, and recruit. Critical Infrastructure Terrorist groups have also notably raised their appeals for lone wolf attacks on state targets as well as critical infrastructure such as hospitals, particularly in Western cities ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic. The FBI also recently foiled the attempted detonating of a car bomb by a White supremacist outside Kansas City, while hospitals treating infected patients have also been identified as valuable targets. A conventional small-arms attack on critical facilities such as hospitals, particularly during times of national emergency, can completely overwhelm an already stressed medical system. The psychological impact of such an attack would also go beyond the immediate victims and foster widespread panic in the general public. Law enforcement agencies will need to be vigilant against such opportunistic attacks. On the other hand, the unprecedented measures rolled out across many countries, including nationwide lockdowns designed to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus, may have had the unintentional consequence of reducing the likelihood of a large- scale domestic terrorist attack. Physical distancing measures, which have also been widely implemented, have also significantly restricted the number of people in places of congregation, hence offering less opportunities for terrorists to launch mass-casualty attacks. The overwhelming number of law enforcement officers being mobilised to patrol public spaces has also made suspicious activity more easily detectable. Authorities could seek to harden critical installations like hospitals. For example, infectious disease treatment centres could be fortified further with additional layers of security. States can also consider decentralising their infectious disease treatment facilities to minimise the impact on their critical healthcare infrastructure, in the event of a successful attack. These security practices could also be replicated for other essential facilities, if required."

    "author(s)": "By Jean-Mathieu REY",
    "date": "No. 103 \u2013 2 July 2021",
    "content": "THANKS TO its overseas territories in the area, France is both a European and an Indo-Pacific nation. La R\u00e9union and Mayotte in the Indian Ocean, New Caledonia, Wallis and Futuna and French Polynesia in the Pacific Ocean firmly anchor France in the Indo-Pacific with more than 1.6 million inhabitants and nine million square kilometres of exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Furthermore, France is the only European Union member to maintain permanent military assets in the Indo-Pacific, with more than 7,000 soldiers and two joint regional commands respectively in charge of the Indian Ocean (ALINDIEN) and the Pacific Ocean (ALPACI). In addition, three joint commands are based in Djibouti, La R\u00e9union and New Caledonia, dedicated to local sovereignty and regional cooperation. This gives ALPACI the responsibility of planning and conducting the French military operations in this strategic and rapidly changing Asia-Pacific area, within the framework of the 2019 French Defence strategy in the Indo-Pacific. France\u2019s Concerns in Asia-Pacific First ALPACI, or the French Pacific Command, is involved on a permanent mission of sovereignty. Protecting French citizens, territories, resources and interests remains its main mission, which could be a challenge given the isolation of some Pacific islands and the size of the expansive oceans. As an example, French Pacific islands are surrounded by some of the world\u2019s largest tuna resources, which are vital to Polynesians and Melanesians; close control of the French EEZ is essential to deter the numerous longliners operating in its vicinity from crossing the maritime border. However, French focus in the Pacific is not limited to French archipelagos but also aims at contributing to the regional security and stability. France has been observing major changes in the regional security context for more than a decade, with the reconfiguration of strategic balances increasing uncertainty. Sino-American competition superimposed on a mosaic of existing tensions: territorial conflicts; global rearming effort; climate change and its consequences; transnational threats such as illegal trafficking, piracy, terrorism and illegal migration, which highly contribute to destabilizing this vast area. Among those tensions, two dimensions deserve special attention: threats against freedom of navigation \u2013 and, more broadly, the issue of international rules-based order \u2013 and nuclear proliferation in North Korea. The COVID-19 crisis has seriously worsened all these tensions. Frequent use of global commons, such as outer space and the cybersphere, is also a concern for Asian countries. French Contribution to Regional Stability As a permanent member of the United-Nations Security Council, a nuclear power, and a nation of the Indo-Pacific, France is in a position to promote and defend freedom of movement, at sea and in the air in the area. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) gives every state the right to sail and operate outside territorial waters and in the international straits. France\u2019s naval commitments across the Pacific are in accordance with this right. French vessels do not, however, conduct dedicated operations such as FONOPS. As part of the 1968 Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, France is deeply concerned by the situation in North Korea. The United Nations Security Council has issued strong resolutions, which have to be implemented by voluntary nations. France is one of them with its Navy warships and aircraft patrolling in the area. French military assets engaged in missions in the Indo-Pacific could be permanent- based Pacific assets, or units coming from mainland France, which include the Carrier Strike Group, submarines, amphibious groups, destroyers, and maritime patrol aircraft. Beginning 2021, six different warships have operated in the area. A nuclear submarine and a support ship have conducted an important deployment departing from their homeport of Toulon to operate up to the Philippine Sea and the South China Sea in January and February 2021. Two frigates, coming from the French bases in the Pacific conducted two successive patrols in the East and South China Sea from January to March. Finally from April to June, the amphibious and cadet training group, Jeanne d\u2019Arc, operates in the area participating in various activities among which an amphibious exercise named ARC21 in Japan with Japanese, American and Australian armed forces. Cooperation and Partnership France\u2019s action is also based on a tradition of cooperation, both multilateral and bilateral. France participates in most of the regional organisations such as the South Pacific Defence Ministers\u2019 Meeting, the Pacific Quadrilateral Coordinating Group, the Western Pacific Naval Symposium (WPNS) and the Indian ocean Naval Symposium (IONS). French commanders work closely with their Pacific partners on environmental security, as shown by France\u2019s leading role in sponsoring a report on the \u201cImplications of climate change on Defence and Security in the South Pacific by 2030\u201d, endorsed by the group of South Pacific nations at a 2019 meeting in Fiji. France is fully engaged in the Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), especially through the Information Fusion Centers (IFC) in Singapore, India or Madagascar, where French liaison officers have been positioned since their respective creation. There is a French inter-agency model of cooperation called the Action of the State at Sea, based on an authority coordinating the different agencies instead of a dedicated coast-guard force. This is of special interest for countries wishing to develop their maritime approach in a pragmatic way. ALPACI is in a position to share French expertise on law enforcement at sea. French actions include support for the Pacific islands countries, through Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) cooperation with mechanisms like the France, Australia, and New Zealand Agreement (FRANZ) or some joint and combined exercises in the Pacific Ocean. France has also a French liaison officer in the Regional Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief Coordination Centre (RHCC) in Singapore. Eventually, ALPACI and the four other joint commands in the area maintain strategic partnerships with the Indo-Pacific countries such as Australia, India, Japan and Singapore and the United States to preserve regional stability and prevent unilateral action by regional powers. Multilateral exercises like La P\u00e9rouse allow partners to train together and to enhance their interoperability. In 2018, French president Emmanuel Macron highlighted in his \u2018Garden Island\u2019 speech during a visit to Sydney the French commitment to Indo-Pacific security, relying on peaceful conflict resolution, state sovereignty and strong actions against climate change. France, as a nation of the Indo-Pacific and a global power is ready to play its role in the area alongside its partners. France is also an EU member. As many European countries show a growing interest in the Indo-Pacific area, France is ready to share its experience in the Indo-Pacific as a robust cornerstone for the build-up of a common European strategic vision."

    "author(s)": "By Yogaananthan S/O Theva",
    "date": "No. 106 \u2013 29 May 2020",
    "content": "THE GLOBAL economy is embroiled in the worst downturn since the Great Depression. Most countries, are witnessing record levels of unemployment and national debt. This is largely due to the disruption of supply chains in China caused by the pandemic. Beata Javorcik, Chief Economist of European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, had aptly said: \u201cOne province of China went on lockdown, and suddenly factories all over the world don\u2019t have supplies.\u201d This reflects how most firms in the technology, automotive and electronics sectors have significantly relied on supply chains within China to maximise efficiency and cost savings. Resultantly, firms struggled to maintain operations during the virus outbreak. New Era of Self-Sufficiency? The global economic fallout has impelled governments from the West and Asia to persuade firms into reshoring their operations to attain supply chain resilience through self-sufficiency. In the United States, there is a greater emphasis by the Trump administration to decouple from China. Peter Navarro, the US Director of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, has clamoured for greater self-sufficiency in manufacturing across different industries, asserting that America had outsourced too much of its supply chains to China. In Europe, political fervour for greater strategic autonomy in supply chains has also intensified. This is evident in President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s recent proclamation that France would strive for \u2018full independence\u2019 in the production of medical equipment. Similarly, in India, Narendra Modi has announced his economic stimulus plan and emphasised that a new era of economic self-sufficiency has begun. Nevertheless, relocating supply chains outside of China is a challenging process. James Mcgregor, Chairman of APCO Worldwide\u2019s Greater China Region, has observed that firms which have done so struggle to replicate China\u2019s production capabilities. China\u2019s Advantage Over the years, China has built a sophisticated supply chain network that enables suppliers of different sizes to collaborate at scale seamlessly. This network is bolstered by a vast distribution system that is built upon efficient transport infrastructure. Additionally, China also offers a large and stable pool of workers who are competent and trained in operating complex machinery. Further, the Chinese government has been proactive in convincing firms of China\u2019s unique competitive advantage as a manufacturing hub. Further, the Chinese government has been proactive in convincing firms of China\u2019s unique competitive advantage as a manufacturing hub. For example, officials from Zhengzhou have been appointed to help Apple Inc\u2019s partner Foxconn recover from the disruptions caused by the pandemic. Additionally, the Ministry of Finance is increasing credit support to the manufacturing sector to help maintain operations. Indeed, as firms re-examine their supply chains for a post-COVID 19 economy, the pressure from governments to reshore operations versus the attractiveness of China as a manufacturing hub will be a persistent geo-economic tension they will have to navigate. Building Resilient Supply Chains: Three Strategies To navigate the post-COVID 19 economy successfully, firms should avoid a rigid, binary approach of completely relying or decoupling from China. Instead, firms should pursue supply chain resilience by being nimble and strategically switching their operations between China and other countries when needed. This can be achieved through three key strategies. Firstly, firms can invest in building \u2018multi-source\u2019 supply chain networks. This involves establishing a network of alternative suppliers, \u2018just-in-case\u2019 counterparts, that can be activated during a specific disruption in China or elsewhere. Importantly, these alternative networks should be geographically diversified to avoid a domino-effect in supply chain disruption in times of crises. Secondly, firms should also invest in circular supply chains either as part of their main or alternative supply chain network. Circular supply chains enable firms to reuse discarded materials and remake them for resale. Using circular supply chain processes, firms such as Renault have been able to keep costs low even when raw materials are increasingly becoming susceptible to price volatility, especially during crises like the pandemic. Hence, if supply chains in China or elsewhere are disrupted, firms can still rely on circular supply chains and incorporate a greater amount of reused materials in their production processes, allowing for more cost control while sustaining operations. Thirdly, it is critical for firms to gain maximum visibility of all their supply chain networks to anticipate disruptions emanating from China or elsewhere and quickly switch to alternative supply chain networks when needed. This entails having real-time data on the level of inventories and output along different value chains. Investing in a More Predictable Future To achieve supply chain visibility, companies such as Corning, Emerson, Hayward, and IBM are utilising digital technologies such as blockchain. technology Blockchain the creation of a complete, reliable, and unchangeable audit trail that tracks an asset from production to delivery. Armed with such data, firms will be able to quickly identify the specific supply chains that will be disrupted and activate alternative supply chains. facilitates Cumulatively, these strategies are not without limitations. In the short-term, firms may incur high investment costs in acquiring the right technologies and designing and implementing new processes. Finding alternative locations for operations and integrating newly established supply chains will be challenging. But in the long term, these are not liabilities, but necessary investments required to be resilient in the increasingly unpredictable post-COVID-19 geo-economic landscape."

    "title": "American Political Dysfunction: The Legislative Dimension",
    "author(s)": "By Adam Garfinkle",
    "date": "No. 054 \u2013 31 March 2021",
    "content": "POLLS CONSISTENTLY report that Congress owns the lowest job approval ratings of any US political institution, oscillating between nine and 31 percent over the past six years. The two major political parties come close behind. The low marks reflect the widespread perception that the dominating, hyper-partisan Republican and Democratic leaderships are more interested in scoring points than in legislating. Not only that, often obvious commonsensical solutions to problems are avoided because party leaderships see festering problems as ammunition for jousting whenever the other side can be blamed for them. These perceptions, while occasionally exaggerated, are not far off the mark. Explaining Institutional Decay Three sources, now joined together, go far to explain the current predicament. The first is that the two major parties have self-sorted in recent decades into ideologically more coherent entities. The fluid, give-and-take pluralism that used to characterise major party coalitions, and enable cross-aisle compromise, is no more. Both parties, commanded by narrow leadership cadres, now act as monolithic ideological blocs arrayed directly against once another. Second, American politics used to be focused locally, with major party coalitions forming only once in four years to nominate a presidential candidate. Over time that valence has flipped; accompanied by changes in media culture, that has made the president a more prominent political personality, and because the president is the only elected official (with the vice-president) who represents the entire nation, it\u2019s the office most prone to populist mobilisation. Most importantly, the once-revolutionary Enlightenment project to base civic life on positive-sum relationships crafted into institutions by self-governing communities has atrophied. The idea that institutional design could harmonise the competitive and cooperative aspects of human nature to benefit the commonweal has fallen prey to the return of the zero-sum mentality, which sees only competition and conflict in political relationships. On this the post-Enlightenment right and left concur: There are only winners and losers, only the survival of the fittest narratives and motivated ideological cores. Loyal Opposition? The classical liberal concept of a \u201cloyal opposition\u201d has thus been vitiated, as have the norms of civility, constructive debate, and respect for truth. In the zero-sum mind one\u2019s opponents are not honourable but evil; their triumph would spell not run-of-the-mill political challenge but imminent national doom. That struggle becomes particularly acute when the electorate is near evenly divided, as it has been recently in the US. When a party gains a majority it tries to squeeze out every advantage before the pendulum swings back to the other side. Everything, including law and even the Constitution itself, gets instrumentalised for partisan purposes; no domain of government, no matter how formerly sacrosanct, is safe from politicisation. In recent years, the impact of the zero-sum redux has registered most vividly among Republicans, with Donald Trump the poster child of the transactionalist dog-eat-dog, no-holds barred type. But \u201cwoke\u201d Democrats are no less illiberal, and their conduct in high office might differ only in the identification of who deserves to win and lose. This is how the zero-sum feeds on itself: Only one side need forsake the positive-sum, pushing the other to sink to that same level or else diminish as a political force. This is how party centres erode in favour of radicals and, once past a certain point, it\u2019s Enlightenment game over: Everyone liars, demagogues, and political consultants. loses except schemers, gifted Biden\u2019s Stimulus Several examples of US political decay-in-progress have been manifest already during the early weeks of the Biden administration. Two have been most prominent. President Biden had an opportunity to launch his economic stimulus plan with significant Republican support in the Senate: His first Oval Office meeting was held to discuss the matter with ten Republican senators, some of whom had voted to convict Trump of impeachable offences just a few days earlier. Biden would have had to compromise the \u201cgo big\u201d scale of the stimulus, but the political benefits of pulling key Republican senators toward the centre and thus splitting the GOP would have diminished Trump\u2019s influence over the party and promised less gridlock going forward. But Biden decided instead to propitiate his own left flank by allowing the bill to include an array of novel anti-poverty measures unrelated to stimulating the economy. The bill thus ended up passing on a simple majority vote without a single Republican assent in the Senate or the House. Those anti-poverty measures, described as temporary, are stalking horses for permanent changes leftwing Democrats seek, and are already providing fodder for exaggerated Republican claims about how dirigiste Biden\u2019s views really are, or how manipulated by the left he is. In truth, too, many Democrats want the Republicans fixed in a rightwing Trumpist position, because they judge the GOP thus easier to beat in 2022 and 2024 if they are. The never-ending campaign thus continues. Voting Rights and Security H.R. 1, officially known as the For the People Act, which is ostensibly about voting rights, furnishes another example. While Republican-dominated state houses in Georgia and elsewhere have been busy designing de facto racist legislation concerning voting modalities. Democrats at the Federal level assembled a bill so partisan and wide-ranging -- covering campaign finance issues as well as voting rights and security concerns -- that it will be dead-on-arrival in the Senate. This is bad timing for a performative gesture, for, while voting fraud is vastly exaggerated, voting rights and technical security issues do require attention. But the Democrats seem as uninterested in actually solving these problems fairly and wisely as the Republicans in the Georgia state house: Both are instead straining to instrumentalise the issue for partisan advantage. Voting rights and security issues would be easy to resolve were that actually the goal. Most voting rights disputes would disappear if election day every two years were made a national holiday, and the complex of fraud and security issues would all but vanish if Congress would authorise a national identity card for use as a voter registration document. The fact that, the same Republicans who exaggerate fraud mostly oppose a national ID document reveals their actual motives: seeking ways to limit voting among minorities that tend to oppose them. The present dysfunction in the US Legislative Branch shows no sign of abating even as public policy deficits worsen. The Biden administration may be the last one with a chance to pull the nation out of its zero-sum-plagued institutional death spiral. So far, the news on that count is not good."

    "title": "SolarWinds & Cyber Diplomacy: The Missing Piece",
    "author(s)": "By Eugene EG Tan",
    "date": "No. 038 \u2013 3 March 2021",
    "content": "IT IS now evident that while the SolarWinds breach affected many government agencies in the United States, and potentially other users of its Orion software like Singapore, the operation has reportedly remained an act of espionage \u2013 something most states if not all do in one form or another. In a statement to the Singapore Parliament on 2 February 2021, Minister for Communications and Information S Iswaran announced that there has been \u201cno indication\u201d that the country\u2019s critical information infrastructure and government systems have been adversely affected by the breach. He recognised that breaches like SolarWinds demonstrate how these cyber threats are first, global in nature; second, will happen again; and, third, are difficult to prevent, and called upon all users and operators to be vigilant in tackling cyber threats. Domestic Responses The breadth of the breach has however led to some observers to bay for blood, with some calling it an act of war and others to retaliate in a visible fashion. However, while such an act harms national security, retaliatory action for espionage activity may not be acceptable under international law. Espionage is, to all intents and purposes, not prohibited under international law, which makes any international response to acts of espionage illegitimate. States are however free to punish these acts based on their respective national laws. Responses to cyber threats that fall under the threshold of international law can thus be separated on two levels: the domestic and the international levels. Exhorting domestic actors to prepare for future cyberattacks and to remain vigilant makes for good domestic policy and will not antagonise other states. But these actions are limited because they do not fundamentally change the behaviour and motivations of state-sponsored threat actors. It is therefore interesting that Singapore has chosen to strengthen its domestic response rather than to build an international or regional consensus on the SolarWinds breach. Singapore has not chosen to punish or push its own attribution of the state actors behind the SolarWinds breach, but has instead chosen to focus on its own protocols and taken steps to strengthen its own cybersecurity processes. Taking steps to improve the resilience and robustness of domestic systems will make it harder for malicious actors to access critical systems and potentially decrease the benefit they derive from compromising these systems. But these steps on their own will not prevent future cyber threats from external sources. Expanding Role of Cyber Diplomacy As cyber threats are becoming more global in nature, there is much more to be considered in an international response to a cyber threat like SolarWinds. As a small state that seeks to be a friend to all, escalating any cyber incident will not benefit Singapore\u2019s national security posture. This does not mean, however, that state- sponsored cyber incidents should remain unaddressed and without consequence to the offending party. Small states like Singapore should therefore consider and review their cyber diplomacy efforts to combat cyber threats. These efforts include building norms of responsible state behaviour, capacity building, and confidence building, which are all pillars of contained in the 2015 UNGGE consensus report. Pillar 1: Norms for Responsible State behaviour Singapore firmly believes that having stronger rules of the road will help define acceptable state behaviour in cyberspace. Singapore has been plugging into the different international conversations at the United Nations like the Open-ended Working Group (OEWG) and the Group of Governmental Experts (UNGGE) to advance discussions on the rules of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. Regionally, Singapore has also been pushing for progress on the adoption and the operationalisation of 11 norms of responsible state behaviour. Additionally, a mechanism for cyber cooperation among ASEAN member states was also proposed at the 2018 Singapore International Cyber Week. When fully operationalised, the combination of the normative framework and cooperation mechanism can lead to a coordinated response that carries the full force of all ASEAN member states. Pillar 2: Capacity Building Singapore, through its ASEAN-Singapore Cybersecurity Centre of Excellence (ASCCE), has also been actively building technical, policy, and legal capacity among ASEAN member states. The benefit of the centre is two-fold: first, it enables states to discharge their obligations and responsibilities in cyberspace such as due diligence; and, second, it builds the trust and assurance among partners in the region. This will ensure that our regional and international partners can be trusted to have the expertise to tackle any cyber breach in the future. Pillar 3: Cyber Confidence Building Measures What Singapore needs to improve on in its cyber diplomacy efforts, however, is the"

Not confined only to health systems, this somewhat dystopian levels of unemployment, worldwide travel bans and restrictions and a global economic standstill. in unprecedented reflected also reality is Organisations scramble to restructure their operations to include remote workforces. While there are companies that have risen to the technological challenges, there are those that struggle to keep afloat while others have inevitably succumbed to the virus crisis. Individuals too have not been spared. The pandemic has forced people into their homes, cutting down social interaction to the bare minimum as workplaces, schools, places of worship and recreation close their doors. Hard Care and Soft Care Despite the numerous pitfalls and uncertainty surrounding the production of a safe and effective vaccine, individuals, organisations, agencies and governments are working tirelessly and often in tandem to provide care to those affected. While the notion of care in the context of COVID-19conjures to mind the administering of medical care, this is but part of a larger all-encompassing social landscape badly in need of the ethics of care. It can be argued that care is an innate human need. However, in times of crisis, it is not always readily available. Everyone cares but may not necessarily be able to exercise care in its true sense. Daniel Engster, a care theorist, defines care as \u201ceverything we do directly to help individuals satisfy their minimal developmental and biological needs\". This care will help to maintain people\u2019s basic capabilities and avoid or alleviate pain and sufferings. Hence, they can survive, develop and function in society and pursue some conception of good life, he says. There are two approaches to care \u2013 \u2018hard\u2019 and \u2018soft\u2019 care. Care as an action is \u2018hard\u2019, and the virtues that complement are the \u2018soft\u2019 care. These virtues are elemental to exercise care successfully. From a \u201ccare\u201d perspective, this crisis has brought out humanity\u2019s most commendable behaviour towards others. Populations have benefitted from additional funding, care packages, public health measures, volunteerism, and many stimuli extended during the COVID-19 pandemic. Special measures and support packages have been formulated and rolled-out swiftly by individuals, communities, agencies and states to help citizens, residents and countries battle the coronavirus. What Does Care Mean in a Pandemic Scenario? Despite the extensive support, there are those who still feel that the assistance rendered is insufficient. What then is the missing component? As much as we give aid as a show of care, it cannot be a mere functional act. There needs to be a balanced combination of reason for caring that may be grounded on logic and emotive motivations to care such as sympathy and compassion. Further to this, care can only be achieved when it is acting according to the virtues of caring. Care theorists generally agree that attentiveness, responsiveness and respect are core virtues and constitutive of caring. The virtue of attentiveness means noticing when another person is in need and responding appropriately while anticipating additional needs. Responsiveness is about engaging with others to discern the precise nature of their needs and monitoring their responses to our care that is, ensuring that they are receiving the care they need. The virtue of respect is about treating people in ways that do not degrade them in their own eyes or in the eyes of others. Care is about alleviating pain and suffering by ensuring that the needs of individuals are attended to. In short, care is purposeful and all encompassing. Obligations to Care In Singapore, communities and the state endeavour to care for their population through a multi-faceted approach. Community groups have joined forces to launch online platforms to help low-income families, provide financial assistance or groceries, and temporary employment to those in need. Religious leaders across the different faiths have pledged to uphold their commitment to maintain solidarity while modifying their religious traditions and practices to prevent the spread of the virus. The government has unveiled four stimulus packages; aptly named Unity, Resilience, Solidarity and Fortitude totalling up to US$65.4 billion or S$92.9 billion to provide support workers and businesses. Care underpins not only our physical, emotional and mental well-being as individuals but also our social, environmental and economic wellbeing as a population. The breadth of care includes everything that we do to maintain, continue, and repair our world so that we can live in it as well as possible, says Joan Tronto, a US professor of political science. That world includes our bodies, ourselves, and our environment, all of which we interweave in a complex, life sustaining web, he adds. In light of the human devastation caused by COVID-19, the ethics of care should be advocated, broadened and considered by private and public-run agencies when formulating policies, drawing up regulations and implementing practices such that there is strengthening of social connectedness in spite of the imposition of physical distance that appear to separate us."

    "author(s)": "By Jasminder Singh",
    "date": "No. 012 \u2013 17 January 2020",
    "content": "FOLLOWING THE five-month Marawi siege in the Philippines since May 2017 in which leading Southeast Asian jihadists such as Isnilon Hapilon and Omar Maute, from the Philippines, and Dr Mahmood Ahmad and Amin Baco, from Malaysia, were killed, many analysts believed the terrorist threat in the region has been largely neutralised. Yet in the last two years, security forces in Southeast Asia continue to foil potential attacks and arrest networks of mainly IS-linked operatives. In this period, around 519 individuals in Malaysia and another 500 in Indonesia have been remanded, while authorities in Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines have also dismantled networks of suspected IS cells and supporters. Leadership Decapitation & Rejuvenation Recent reports of senior Malaysian militants Akel Zainal and Rafi Udin being killed in counter-terrorist operations in Syria have meant there are currently no known Southeast Asian fighters holding leadership positions within IS in Syria and Iraq. This is significant as a living Southeast Asian fighter stands a greater chance of being accepted as \u2018the\u2019 leader of IS\u2019 affiliate networks in the region, having earned the status of having fought and survived the \u2018jihad\u2019 in the Middle East. There is thus interest on who will emerge to lead the various IS networks affected by leadership losses in Southeast Asia. In Indonesia, veteran ideologues such as Aman Abdurrahman and Abu Bakar Baasyir remain alive, albeit in remand, and continue to have some influence on their specific radical circles in Indonesia specifically. However, the Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), the largest terrorist group in the country, currently operates as a loose network of autonomous pro-IS cells, following significant losses to its central and provincial leadership in recent years. In the Philippines, there are known persons (such as Hatib Sawadjaan and Furuji Indama, who helm IS\u2019 branches in Sulu and Basilan provinces respectively) who have emerged to lead IS-linked groups there. In contrast, Malaysian IS networks have been disrupted by the recent loss of key figures such as Akel and Rafi. Going forward, with IS\u2019 affiliates worldwide retaking their pledges of allegiance to the newly declared IS leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi, including networks in Southeast Asia, it is likely new individuals will emerge into leadership roles, possibly from the pool of regional militants returning from the Middle East or among the kin of dead IS terrorists. Post-Caliphate Landscape According to estimates, nearly 1000 Indonesians, 100 Malaysians and some nationals from the Philippines and Singapore had journeyed (hijrah) to IS-controlled territory in Syria during the height of its caliphate operations between 2015 and 2017. Since then, some 85 Indonesians and 40 Malaysians have been reportedly killed in battle, many of them male suicide bombers. Several of these ideologically hardened and combat ready fighters could seek to return home, following IS\u2019 territorial losses in Syria; many are currently either held in prison and detention camps, or still fighting for IS\u2019 remaining networks there. Having developed ideological affinity, shared experiences in battle and close personal ties with fighters from within and outside Southeast Asia, they could seek to form alliances to coordinate terror operations around the region once back home. There is clear precedent for such a scenario. During the 1980s, many Southeast Asian jihadists migrated to Afghanistan to join the so-called jihad against Soviet occupation. Several who subsequently returned formed the nucleus of the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), which was responsible for high-profile terrorist attacks in the 1990s and early 2000s. For IS, whose regional affiliates are already among the most organised in Asia, the prospective return of battle-hardened fighters from the Syrian theatre, could fortify these networks further. Implications & Outlook for Regional Security Effectively tackling potential women and child returnees is also vital. As was evident in the Surabaya bombings in May 2018, women and children have taken on increasingly prominent roles in jihadi operations regionally. Adopting best practices from programmes used in other countries on this issue could buttress the \u2018tool kit\u2019 of regional counter-terrorism practitioners, although they would need to be adapted to the Asian context. The infiltration of non-Southeast Asian militants into the region to participate in terror attacks, some of whom may have previously forged links with Southeast Asian IS fighters in Syria and Iraq, also requires monitoring. This was evident during the 2017 Marawi siege, when a number of foreign jihadists were killed in clashes with security forces, including some Uighurs in Indonesia. The death of leading Southeast Asian jihadists such as Hapilon and Akel raises important questions about the future course of the regional threat landscape, an issue brought more sharply into focus since the death of al-Baghdadi. Authorities are expected to closely monitor who fills the leadership vacuum within jihadist networks in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines following the death of key leaders in these countries. Although a new IS Emir in Southeast Asia has not been clearly designated following the death of Hapilon in October 2017, local and regional leaders will likely emerge from the group of battle-hardened fighters who migrated to the Middle East theatre and have since returned. Potential leaders could also emerge from the expansive networks of local IS affiliates, supporters and sympathisers dotted around the region. The re-emergence of JI is also most likely to be closely monitored. Since JI\u2019s last attack in the region in 2009, it has regrouped, and consolidated its position, especially in Indonesia. JI could consolidate its position further, especially since many of its key leaders remain alive. These include Yazid Sufaat, a prominent biochemist and bomb-maker, who was recently released by Malaysian authorities after almost two decades in custody. JI\u2019s reinvigoration also provides a potential well-trodden path for IS\u2019 own resurgence in the region. Possible tactical alliances, involving JI and pro-IS cells to launch joint attacks, also cannot be discounted."

    "author(s)": "By Pradumna B Rana",
    "date": "No. 177 \u2013 8 October 2020",
    "content": "SINCE CHINA launched the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013 to connect and integrate the Afro-Eurasian super-continent, four powers, including India, have come up with their own counter-initiatives. Japan has the Enhanced Partnership for Quality International Infrastructure Development Finance Corporation (IDFC), and the European Union has introduced a Strategy for Connecting Europe and Asia. the United States has established initiative; the In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi came up with a new policy for cross-border connectivity soon after he was elected in 2014. He announced the \u201cNeighbourhood First\u201d Policy which shifted India irreversibly towards strengthening intra- and inter- regional connectivity. In 2015, the Act East Policy was announced with a similar objective. \u201cConnectivity\u201d has, therefore, emerged as the country\u2019s newest geostrategic buzzword. But the government\u2019s success in implementing the new policy has been mixed. What should be done to make India\u2019s counter-strategy work better? Success in Bilateral and Sub-Regional Cooperation After its independence, India had kept itself isolated and disconnected from its neighbouring countries. There were several India-led cross-border initiatives, but Delhi\u2019s position towards its neighbours was that of \u201cbenign neglect\u201d. Presently in response to the rise of China, India has made regional connectivity a top priority. Initially, India had preferred the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) as the vehicle for pursuing regional infrastructure cooperation. But this did not make much progress because of Indo-Pakistani rivalry. India has, therefore, adopted a dual-track approach to connectivity comprising intra- and inter-regional approaches. Encouraging progress has been made in bilateral and sub-regional projects. Over a dozen new Integrated Check Posts have been constructed to facilitate trade with Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar and Nepal. Inland waterway agreements are also being operationalised with Bangladesh and Nepal. The number of railway connections with Bangladesh has increased from one in 2008 to four. In 2019, India and Nepal inaugurated South Asia\u2019s first cross-border oil pipeline. Sub-Regional Traction In terms of sub-regional cooperation, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal (BBIN) economic cooperation has gained considerable traction. BBIN Motor Vehicle Agreement for free movement of people, goods, and motor vehicles has been implemented, although Bhutan has withdrawn temporarily. Recently, Bangladesh has allowed its ports in Chittagong and Mongla to be used as a transit for cargo moving to India\u2019s north-eastern states. This cuts the distance between Kolkota to Agartala via Assam from 1600 kilometres to 450 km. Encouraged by this development, BBIN countries are implementing plans to enhance multimodal connectivity in the sub-region. With BBIN, India\u2019s Northeast region is emerging as the bridgehead between South and Southeast Asia. South Asia Sub-regional Economic Cooperation programme, which is supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), has completed about 50 regional projects worth over US$11 billion. Inter-Regional Connectivity: Not So Successful India\u2019s inter-regional connectivity projects have, however, been less successful. In the western region, India is supporting the International North-South Transport Corridor for moving freight between India, Iran, Afghanistan, Armenia, Russia, Central Asia, and Europe by avoiding Pakistan. There is also the India-Iran-Afghanistan Transit Corridor which focuses on the southern Iranian port of Chabahar, which is strategically located close to the China- operated Gwadar port in Pakistan. Progress on these projects has been slow because, under the pressure from the US which has imposed sanctions against Iran over the latter\u2019s nuclear ambitions, India has dragged its feet. In the eastern region, India has four initiatives to enhance connectivity with ASEAN. The first is the Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Corridor which is a sea-river- land hybrid corridor that seeks to improve India\u2019s access to its North-Eastern Region through Myanmar. Although initiated more than two decades ago, this project has yet to take-off because of financing problems and hostility from the Arakan Army, a rebel group in Myanmar. The Trilateral Highway project between India\u2019s Northeast region, Myanmar\u2019s Bagan and Thailand\u2019s Mae Sot has also met a similar fate. The third is the Mekong-India Economic Corridor which aims to jumpstart India-Southeast Asia trade and investment linkages by connecting Chennai to Ho Chi Minh City through Dawei Port in Myanmar. This project has stalled after the project\u2019s main contractor, Italthai Group, pulled out. The sole promising project in the eastern region is the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi- Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), between the BBIN countries, Sri Lanka, and two ASEAN countries (Thailand and Myanmar). The BIMSTEC Motor Vehicle Agreement is being negotiated and the BIMSTEC Master Plan on Transport Connectivity has been prepared. Resetting India\u2019s Connectivity Policy Based on India\u2019s experiences and those of the East Asian countries, India\u2019s cross- border connectivity policy needs to be reset in at least five ways: \u2022 First, cross-border projects should be selected through proper data analysis and project evaluation techniques. Stakeholder and NGO participation should also be sought. \u2022 Second, instead of ambitious initiatives, India should seek to implement relatively smaller and actionable projects. Indian initiatives face financial obstacles because of limited fiscal space. Its public sector banks are also not well capitalised, and private banks are too risk averse. \u2022 Third, coordination problem needs to be addressed. India\u2019s foreign infrastructure policy-making process is incoherent and decentralised. No single agency is responsible. A cabinet-level steering body might also be required. \u2022 Fourth, successful connectivity policy requires trade openness. This is because ports, roads, railways, and airports will be of little use if barriers to trade are not dismantled. India should encourage trade openness and trade facilitation among South Asian countries. \u2022 Fifth, India should further deepen cooperation with other Great Powers and multilateral development banks. With Japan and the US, India has established a trilateral infrastructure financing facility. Cooperation with Australia has also increased. In Bangladesh, India has tied up with Russia to develop a nuclear power plant. A lot more joint activities and co-financing are necessary. Summing up, Modi\u2019s new policy for cross-border connectivity has placed regional connectivity prominently on the Indian government\u2019s agenda. However, for this policy to be successful, especially in the context of similar initiatives of other powers, it needs to be reset."

    "author(s)": "By Rajeev Ranjan Chaturvedy and Graham Sherbut",
    "date": "No. 099 \u2013 20 May 2020",
    "content": "A FRIEND in need is a friend indeed. This is especially true when the whole world is reeling under unprecedented crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As maritime neighbours, India and the countries of East Africa have a long history of trade relations, as well as cultural and educational exchanges. The large and influential Indian diaspora in East Africa has often been at the forefront of these interactions. Under the premiership of Narendra Modi, however, India and the countries of East Africa have visibly enhanced their level of direct political engagement and development cooperation. Modi refers to India\u2019s increasing ties as the \u2018Indian Ocean Family\u2019 in East Africa. These include: Delhi\u2019s provision of a US$100 million line of credit under which Seychelles can purchase military surveillance equipment from India; the donation of medical equipment, notably the Bhabhatron, to support improved cancer care in Kenya; as well as the deployment of three navy vessels to deliver humanitarian assistance to Mozambique in the aftermath of Cyclone Idai in 2019. India-East Africa Healthcare Cooperation Given the current health pandemic, are there prospects for Indian-East African engagement to strengthen further, particularly in healthcare? There is considerable precedence for such cooperation. Indian pharmaceutical firms, such as Cipla Ltd. in the early 2000s and, more recently, Mylan and Aurobindo, have provided many of the generic anti-retroviral drugs imported by African states to combat HIV/AIDS. Meanwhile, India\u2019s Pan-African e-Network, first launched in 2009, has connected hospitals in 53 African countries with medical practitioners in India to provide tele- medicine training and consultations. The speed and ferocity at which COVID-19 has placed existing health systems under strain, however, begs the question of whether such health-focused cooperation remains viable and, if it is, where it may be most effective. India and a number of East African countries share an array of common challenges with the current pandemic. Each have under-resourced health systems (particularly in rural areas), young populations, significant rural-to-urban migration, urban overcrowding and large informal sectors whose workers are struggling to cope with some of the world\u2019s strictest national lockdowns. However, there are two areas in which India and its East African partners may stand to benefit from healthcare-focused cooperation. Two Areas for Expansion The first of these areas relates to contact tracing. While entailing controversy over matters of personal data privacy, the Aarogya Setu app, created by India\u2019s National Informatics Centre, is already beginning to have an impact in using Bluetooth technology to effectively track COVID-19 patients and those they come into contact with. This, in turn, is providing Indian authorities and medical practitioners with the data they require to understand the spatial dynamics of the virus and to forecast the virus\u2019 near- term spread. This brings with it the prospect of India\u2019s national and state governments being able to implement more geographically-targeted lockdowns rather than the blunt nationwide lockdown currently in place. For countries like Kenya and Mozambique, which have followed India\u2019s lead in putting in place similar \u2013 if not quite as rigorously enforced \u2013 national lockdowns, the absence of similar rigorous contact tracing data or, equally likely, an inability to actively interpret and make use of these data in real-time, may prove catastrophic. Cooperation in the area of contact tracing may pertain partially to apps development, though a number of East Africa\u2019s own burgeoning tech firms are likely more than capable to developing appropriate, if perhaps less comprehensive, equivalents. Perhaps most useful would be direct engagement by Indian policymakers and medical practitioners. As they gain knowledge and experience through Aarogya Setu, they can liaise with their counterparts in East Africa \u2013 and particularly those working at sub-national levels \u2013 to share lessons learned and knowledge on how to interpret data from contact tracing technologies and build these data into epidemiological models capable of informing intelligent and responsive containment measures. Given some of the similarities between the two geographies, Indian insights may prove more relevant and credible than engagement from equivalent authorities in the global north. Deepening South-South Ties in Healthcare The second area, perhaps slightly longer-term in focus, pertains to the education and training of health professionals. The eVidya Bharti e Arogya Bharti (eVBAB) project, launched in October 2019, builds on the Pan-African e-Network to provide an expansive e-portal, training opportunities for African doctors, nurses and paramedics. inclusive of more comprehensive tele-medicine Mauritius and Mozambique are the two East African countries being prioritised for eVBAB\u2019s initial rollout by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. While e-trainings relating to COVID-19 could potentially be useful to medical professionals of all types, a particularly impactful approach may be to use the projects\u2019 tele-medicine platforms as an opportunity for experience exchange among Community Health Workers (CHWs). CHWs are at the forefront of community-level care for COVID-19 in countries like Mozambique; the experiences of their counterparts in India, Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs), could prove invaluable in outlining \u2018best practices\u2019 for identifying, tracking and supporting COVID-19 patients, their families and communities. India and the countries along Africa\u2019s Indian Ocean coast have a long history and cultural connectedness. As India and East African states increasingly engage at the political level and as partners in development, COVID-19 provides a clear opportunity for deepening \u2018south-south\u2019 cooperation and establishing Delhi as a leader in healthcare policy and practice."

    "author(s)": "By Pradumna B Rana",
    "date": "No. 064 \u2013 20 April 2021",
    "content": "AFTER DECADES of increasing globalisation that brought economic prosperity worldwide, signs of deglobalisation emerged after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in 2008. COVID-19 has amplified this trend. How serious is the situation and is globalisation dead? Globalisation has many components: cross-border flows of trade, investment, finance, people including migrant workers and tourists, data, and digital technology. Over the years, it has led to closer economic integration at the global level. One way to assess how integrated the global economy has become is to focus on the global trade openness ratio. Defined as the sum of world exports and imports divided by world GDP, it is regarded as a reasonable and commonly-used proxy for global economic integration. Globalisation 1.0: The First of Four Phases During the past one and a half century, globalisation has passed through four phases (figure below). Globalisation 1.0 refers to the period 1870-1913 when the world was on the gold standard. During this period exchange rates of currencies were fixed to gold which in turn was freely mobile across countries. Central banks were also not permitted to intervene in currency markets. Strict observance of these rules contributed to monetary stability and the global trade openness ratio increased from 17.6% to 29% during this period. Deglobalisation 1.0 During the Inter-War period, or Deglobalisation 1.0, the global trade openness ratio fell sharply from 29% in 1913 to 10% in 1945.After 1913, countries abandoned the gold standard to pursue independent monetary policies in order to finance World War I (WW I). Absence of rules and regulations led to chaos and instability. Russia withdrew from the world trading system after the communist revolution of 1917. The United Kingdom attempted to go back to the gold standard but it was unsuccessful. Subsequently, countries adopted \u201cbeggar thy neighbour\u201d policies. For example, in the early 1930s, the United States, UK, and France resorted to competitive currency devaluations. These tit-for-tat policies partially contributed to the Great Depression of the 1930s when the volume of international trade halved and world output fell by 15%. The League of Nations was founded after WW I to promote peace. But it failed to prevent WW II and was replaced by the United Nations in 1946. Globalisation 2.0 After World War II (WW II), policymakers in the US realised that they alone could lead global affairs. Hence at the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944 the US helped establish the rules-based world economic order comprising the IMF (for monetary stability), the GATT and its successor the World Trade Organisation (WTO) (for open trading environment) and the World Bank (for poverty reduction). Rules set by these global economic institutions ushered in the Golden Age of Globalisation when world trade expanded several times faster than world output. Global supply chain trade comprising trade in parts and components also started to gather pace after the Information and Communications Technology revolution of the 1980s. During this phase, Globalisation 2.0, the world trade openness ratio increased six-fold from 10% in 1945 to 60% to 2008. Deglobalisation 2.0 Globalisation was a key driver of the world economy for much of the post- WWII period. But this stopped after the global economic crisis in 2008. Global supply chains which accounted for about 50% of world also ceased expanding. Deglobalisation 2.0 started to set in for a number of reasons: First, the slow economic recovery after the GFC led to rising nationalism and protectionism in the Western world and eventually elsewhere. Under the former president Donald Trump, the US embraced the \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy and protectionism shifting away from trade liberalisation of the past. Tariffs were imposed on about 20% of total imports of the US mainly from China. The US also sought to disband China-centered supply chains. Similarly, European countries also initiated policy actions to protect their economies especially from rising inflows of migrant workers from the Middle East. Countries around the world retaliated and became more inward-looking. Although it remains an export powerhouse, China has turned inwards to some extent. Since 2020, India has also adopted a more self-reliant policy. COVID-19\u2019s Impact on Globalisation Second, COVID-19 affected globalisation in several ways. Because of the lockdowns, international trade and tourism \u201cfell off the cliff\u201d during the second quarter of 2020. Although the volume of world trade has rebounded more strongly than expected since then, the March 2021 forecast from the WTO expects a 5.3% fall in 2020. COVID-19 also disrupted global supply chains as intermediate products could not be transported with ease between production blocks located in different parts of the world. COVID-19 laid bare the risks of relying on complex \u201cjust in time\u201d value chains and raised awareness of the need to diversify sources and shorten global supply chains by onshoring, near-shoring, and sourcing regionally rather than globally. Many countries also questioned their dependence on import of essential medical equipment (e.g., PPEs) and medical supplies of which they might be deprived in an emergency. They, therefore, imposed temporary export bans. Third, since the mid-2010s, national security has become a crucial cause of the deterioration in US-China relations and trade. It is argued that China\u2019s accession to the WTO in 2001 has led to a large negative impact on US manufacturing. China\u2019s presumed systematic practice of industrial and cyber-espionage has also led to stiff tariffs and bans on China\u2019s acquisition of US technology. Fourth, the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiation has been stalled since 2008. In its stead regional trading agreements have proliferated. When will Deglobalisation End? Is globalisation dead? No, it is not dead, but it is in a partial retreat. When will the retreat be over? It is difficult to say precisely but it may take some time for protectionist sentiments around the world to turn around and for national security concerns in the US vis-a-vis China to abate. But Deglobalisation 2.0 will probably be milder and than Deglobalisation 1.0 which lasted for about 30 years and when the global trade openness ratio fell by nearly 13 percentage points. This time around the ratio has fallen much less, by only about three percentage points \u2013 so far. less disruptive"

    "content": "ON 16 APRIL 2020, Czech authorities warned its international allies of \u201cimminent, large scale attacks on hospitals\u201d. They know the effects of such an operation. Brno University Hospital, the second largest hospital in Czech Republic, has had to reschedule operations, relocate patients, and delay some COVID-19 test results due to a cyberattack in mid-March 2020. EUROPOL has confirmed that almost all of its 27 member countries have reported intensifying cyberattacks on its healthcare systems. Criminal hacker groups have demanded ransom from hospitals dealing with overload from coronavirus patients by locking their patient records, and threatening to publish these records online. This causes further unwanted strain on healthcare systems. This trend of cyberattacks done by criminal hacker groups and possibly state-sponsored actors is set to continue. Harnessing Cyber Norms Hospitals and healthcare providers were prime targets even before COVID-19 because cyber security was not prioritised. In light of COVID-19, cyber security concerns may have been further deprioritised because of the lack of capacity in dealing with the pandemic. Consequently, healthcare providers are under immense pressure to pay ransoms. There is a reason why these are termed as critical infrastructure, and states have an obligation to protect them. These obligations include honouring those previously agreed to ensure normative responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. There have been several processes like the Global Commission on Cyber Stability (GCSC) and the Paris Call that have proposed norms to protect critical infrastructure and the core of the Internet."

    "title": "Russian Balancing Strategy: Setbacks in 2020?",
    "author(s)": "By Chris Cheang",
    "date": "No. 173 \u2013 21 September 2020",
    "content": "RUSSIA HAS enormous stakes in stable Sino-Indian relations and cannot be indifferent to the increased tensions between the two Asian powers. Moscow plays a key role in the Russia-India-China (RIC) triangle, Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), and the BRICS, which are important Russian foreign policy platforms. The RIC foreign ministers have been meeting trilaterally since 2003; the RIC\u2019s importance to Russian foreign policy is clear: China and India are seen as crucial to achieving Russia\u2019s objectives of building a multipolar world, with less US/Western influence in the Asia-Pacific in particular and the world in general. China, India in Russia\u2019s Balancing Strategy Established in 2001, with China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, as founder members, the SCO\u2019s broad objectives are to stabilise relations among the Central Asian states with their two powerful neighbours and to promote the development of its members. India and Pakistan joined in 2017. The SCO has proven useful for Central Asia to work principally with China and Russia on a multilateral basis, to balance both powers which are crucial to their well-being and development. For Russia, India balances the growing weight of China in the SCO and in Central Asia itself, a key region to Moscow. The sustainability and even political future of the SCO therefore depend much on the dynamics of the relationship between China and India, given their politico-economic and military weight and membership in the SCO. Should their bilateral tensions worsen, they would have some negative impact on the SCO\u2019s functioning and effectiveness as a forum and platform for Russia\u2019s own interests. The BRICS forum is key to Russia\u2019s foreign policy objectives of lessening US/Western global influence in geopolitical and geo-economic terms as well as to Russia\u2019s economic objectives of promoting more economic interaction among the BRICs member states. To Russia, India and China are important partners in Eurasia and hence, are seen are the key players in BRICS. Brazil and South Africa are too geographically and politically distant to play any meaningful role in Eurasia. Tension between the two Asian powers might weaken BRICS member states\u2019 commitments to their economic and socio-political objectives and declarations; the worst-case scenario would be a looser BRICS. Russia holds the Chairmanship in 2020 of the SCO and BRICS and hence must be concerned about the ramifications of Sino-Indian tensions on the work of the SCO and BRICS in the immediate and near-term. Russia\u2019s own bilateral links with China and India are also crucial to its global position and its own economic development. Russo-Indian and Russo-Chinese Relations India is a major purchaser of Russian weapons and growing investor in the Russian energy sector. Enjoying close links with India also ensures that Russia can counterbalance the growing strategic and politico-economic weight of China in the Asia-Pacific as well as in Central Asia. At the same time, Russia does not want to see India\u2019s relations with the United States become stronger than they already are. For instance, Russia would not want India to become an active member of the Quad; Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reportedly criticised this US-led Indo-Pacific initiative, calling it a \"divisive approach\" to disrupt existing regional structures and contain China. An indication of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s close relationship with Indian PM Narendra Modi was seen in the former\u2019s warm greetings to Modi on his 70th birthday on 17 September 2020. No doubt, this gesture was not only well-meant personally but also acted as an indication of Russia\u2019s close links with India. Russia\u2019s strong relationship with China is a function of their common threat perception of the US, their current economic complementarity (Russian energy for Chinese goods) and strategic convergence in the Asia-Pacific to ensure that the region is not dominated by the US and its allies like Japan. China is also a major importer of Russian energy, a major investor in its energy sector, and Russia\u2019s largest trading partner. Both have been conducting military exercises bilaterally or with other countries in the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO). This is a military alliance comprising six post-Soviet republics, namely Russia, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Of late, observers have prematurely speculated about a de facto alliance between Russia and China. However, the border clashes with India appear to have led to Russian concern about China. According to a South China Morning Post article in August 2020, the Chinese websites NetEase and Sohu reported in July that deliveries of the Russian S-400 missile system had been \u201cdelayed\u201d due to the coronavirus, but Moscow said later the deliveries had been \u201csuspended\u201d. One can only speculate as to Russia\u2019s motives in this regard. Russia as Unofficial Honest Broker For the above reasons, tense Sino-Indian relations are not in Russia\u2019s interest. The fact that India and China have sought to iron out their differences on the sidelines of the mid-September SCO Foreign Ministers\u2019 meeting in Moscow illustrates Russia\u2019s crucial role in trying to reduce tensions, as an unofficial honest broker. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his Indian counterpart, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, agreed to improve mutual trust to ensure peace along their disputed border, and to avoid any action that could escalate the situation; however, no mention was made of any troop withdrawal date. Their Russian counterpart Lavrov was quoted as saying that Russia was \u201cvery happy\u201d to have provided \u201ca platform\u201d for the two Asian powers to discuss the border tensions and stabilise the situation. Nevertheless, India\u2019s defence minister reportedly said on 15 September that the border issue remains \"unresolved\u201d. Noteworthy is that the Sino-Indian relationship is now undergoing difficulties on the economic front as well. The fact that Sino-Indian tensions still remain and have spilled over into the economic realm manifests the obvious limits of Russian influence on either of its crucial partners. Russia can therefore only wait-and-see how far the situation will unfold. Moscow\u2019s difficult balancing posture in the last several years between the two Asian powers might turn out to be not as practical as it could have been assumed all this time."

    "title": "US Presidential Election 2020 The Biden Presidency: A Different China Policy?",
    "author(s)": "By Zhang Baohui",
    "date": "No. 195 \u2013 13 November 2020",
    "content": "THE PROJECTED victory of Joe Biden in the United States presidential election raises the question of whether his China policy will significantly differ from that of the Trump administration. This question is important due to the major changes in the China policy of the US under Donald Trump. These changes have profoundly affected the dynamics of not only Sino-US ties but also international relations in the Asia Pacific region. The Trump administration\u2019s emphasis on great power competition has drastically sharpened strategic rivalry between China and the US. Other countries in the region have faced increasing pressure to \u201cchoose sides\u201d. The critical question that many are asking now is what will the Biden administration\u2019s China policy be like? Biden\u2019s China Policy in an Anarchic Order In the study of international relations, the matter here fundamentally concerns the classic \u201cman vs. structure\u201d issue. Whether individual leaders matter in terms of foreign policies of state has been continuously debated by scholars. Also known as agency vs. structure debate, most IR scholars place great stress on the incentives and constraints posed by the environment, be it domestic or international. They tend to see significant continuities in the foreign policies of states. On the other hand, some argue that the tendency to overlook the roles of individual leaders is misguided, as their personalities and background experiences do affect their approaches to foreign policy. Therefore, whether leaders can make a difference in the foreign policy of states is a significant issue for the rest of the world to gauge Joe Biden\u2019s China policy. Here, structural approaches to the study of international relations suggest that the anarchic order of the international system will impose significant constraints on Biden and his China policy will continue to emphasise strategic competition. The anarchic international system forces states, especially the great powers, to put a premium on their relative power and influences over rival great powers. In fact, this is the key insight of offensive realism, famously coined by American political scientist John Mearsheimer. Defensive realism, which is another structural theory, also predicts continued rivalry between China and the US. The anarchic order causes the security dilemma between states due to mutual mistrust. Continued Strategic Rivalry? As power continues to shift between China and the US, they both tend to assume the worst about the other\u2019s intentions. While Beijing sees the US determined to thwart its rise, Washington sees China determined to undermine its global primacy. In this context many have argued that strategic rivalry will continue under the Biden administration. It is now widely accepted that there is a strong consensus in the US regarding its China policy. A structural perspective on Biden\u2019s China policy will therefore predict that his administration will more or less continue a policy of strategic competition. However, leaders do possess different ideas about the foreign policy challenges that confront their countries. According to constructivist IR theory, ideas matter. They shape leaders\u2019 understanding of the issues they face and ways to resolve these issues. Different leaders subscribe to different ideas, thereby leading to significant variations in their foreign policies and strategies. Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s \u201cnew thinking\u201d is often said to be the key factor in the rapid end of the Cold War in the late 1980s. No structural approaches to the study of international relations predicted this outcome. Biden\u2019s Restrained or Selective Competition? From this perspective, the Biden administration\u2019s China policy could see significant differences from that of the Trump administration. While his China policy may continue to reflect the competition logic, it would nonetheless show major differences at the operational level. For example, while Biden does see China as the biggest competitor, he also argues that the US needs to carefully manage its relations with Beijing in order to avoid scenarios such as military conflicts. In the trade area, he has indicated that while he would also pursue a more reciprocal trade relationship with China, he nonetheless considers the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration harming American consumers and companies. As a typical liberal Democrat, Biden has also promised that his government would once again pay more attention to urgent global governance issues, ranging from COVID-19 to climate change. In this regard, his administration may seek China\u2019s cooperation on these issues. The above indicate that under the Biden presidency Sino-US relations will see more restrained strategic competition, perhaps even selective cooperation. The Biden presidency will therefore offer an interesting test of the agency vs. structure debate in international relations. In the coming year his administration\u2019s China policy will tell if leaders or the international system play greater roles in shaping the foreign policies of states. Will Biden\u2019s China policy be significantly different from that of Trump's? The answer to this question will not only shed light on a classic debate in the study of international relations but also shape international politics in the next few years with Biden in the White House. How different will the US be under a Biden presidency?"

    "title": "Two Summits: Enter the US\u2019 Sinocentric Era",
    "author(s)": "By Adam Garfinkle",
    "date": "No. 093 \u2013 11 June 2021",
    "content": "BENEATH THE inevitable distractions that attend the start of any US administration \u2500 a mini-war in Gaza, a virtual climate summit show and an Afghanistan withdrawal decision drama, for examples \u2500 is a policy priority template about to unfurl; wise observers can discern this by focussing on the order of early presidential attention and time allotted to foreign leaders. That President Joe Biden\u2019s first two face-to-face bilaterals have been with major treaty allies in East Asia is not without significance. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga\u2019s visit on 16 April 2021 and South Korean (ROK) President Moon Jae-in\u2019s arrival on 21 May, signal that the Sinocentric era in US policy is clearly upon us. These meetings should be seen as the first acts in a globe-sprawling drama bound to play out long before us. Irking the Dragon It helped that both summits followed on the heels of the testy language offered up during a meeting between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan with China\u2019s top diplomats, CCP foreign affairs chief Yang Jiechi and China's State Councilor Wang Yi, in Anchorage, Alaska on 18 March. Senior US officials usually do not quietly rejoice when headlines report \u201cbarbed exchanges\u201d, \u201cwar of words\u201d, and \u201crage\u201d. This time, however, the headlines fit the purpose of teeing up productive summits. Chinese behaviour at and on the sidelines of the virtual Climate Summit of April 22- 23, at once dissimulative and condescending, helped further as Suga departed and Moon prepared to arrive. A frothing common adversary does wonders for bilateral security alliances. That said, Biden\u2019s meetings with Prime Minister Suga and President Moon could hardly have differed more in tone. China, along with North Korea (DPRK), loomed large in both, yet larger still was the impact of domestic politics on all sides. Unlike the case in the US and South Korea, Japanese politics today are notably not polarised or out of sync with US assumptions and expectations. But Japanese and South Korean diplomatic postures are polarised, making US efforts to triangulate effective alliance strategy in Northeast Asia a persistent chore. This is the more so when Korean politics churns up a leader at odds with US security premises. Thus, despite some enduring differences of view, the US-Japan summit was a love fest compared to the US-ROK affair, where dissonance snuck through despite the exertions of diplomatic etiquette. Suga Sweet Suga has been prime minister only since September 2020, having been Chief Cabinet Secretary under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe from 2012 to his elevation as prime minister. At age 72, Suga seems a compromise candidate within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, and a transitional figure waiting upon the next generation to sort itself out. Experienced US officials fret that Suga\u2019s might be one in a series of short-lived and therefore weak prime ministerial tenures, as was the case between the end of Junichiro Koizumi\u2019s time in office in 2006 and Abe\u2019s consolidation of authority in 2012. Presaged by the sherpa-like 16 March Tokyo visit of Secretary of State Blinken and Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin, Washington recognised these limits, so focused on making digestible incremental improvements in the relationship. The two joint statements, of 16 March and 16 April, thus tracked well as lines of talk without much in the way of deliverables. Most notable was how strongly anti-Chinese both were. Much US-based ranked this as an American achievement, but in truth the Japanese preferred the more muscular US approach of the Trump period to that of the inert second Obama administration, and hoped to bind the Biden administration to that toughened tack. That proved easy, for the politics of being anti-PRC now resonate loudly \u2500 too loudly, perhaps \u2500 for Democrats against the populist-infused optic of trade issues; dissing China has become a centrepiece of the \u201cforeign policy for the middle class\u201d. Japan\u2019s Two Concerns The final section of the 16 April Joint Statement, \u201cAn Alliance for a New Era,\u201d which emphasised the \u201cnon-traditional\u201d aspects of national security so dear to many Democratic foreign policy thinkers, punctuated the point in a decidedly novel way. At US behest, the allies formed a \u201cCompetitive and Resilience Partnership\u201d focused on \u201ccompetitiveness and innovation, COVID-19 response, global health, and health security, climate change, clean energy, and green growth and recovery\u201d. Behind such high-sounding if very broad language senior Japanese officials espy two trends of potential concern. First, gone are the trade deficits harangues of the Trump era, but a mercantilist tilt yet abides in the fact that all these new elements are tied to US economic interests as perceived by key domestic constituencies. (The same was true for the multiple new international projects mooted within the rubric of the Climate Summit.) What the Executive Branch is doing via diplomatic initiatives the Democrats in Congress are doing through the budget process: bend all rubrics and category slots to politically resonant domestic economic priorities. It makes sense: Lose the political battle at home, in 2022 and especially 2024, and security policy authority will be lost with it. Jeopardising Deterrence and Defence The Japanese also note that Washington has yet to apply to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2500 now the CPTPP without US accession \u2500 or has even abrogated the absurd Trump-era punitive tariffs levied against Canada for being \u201ca threat to US national security\u201d. When Trade Representative Katherine Tai was asked why not, she answered \u201cleverage\u201d. Officials in Tokyo cannot have been pleased to hear that word. Second, they wonder whether pursuit of non-traditional portfolios may eventually jeopardise deterrence and defence. They don\u2019t cheer a Navy budget asking for fewer new ships and declining 2.2 percent in real terms against inflation, for it may presage requests that Japan reach deeper into its own pocket for the common defence. They worry, too, about US officials switching out the aim of \u201cdenuclearising North Korea\u201d for the \u201cdenuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula\u201d; that would threaten a much leaner US strategic deterrence posture in Northeast Asia supposedly made safe by unredeemable hopes that \u201cputting diplomacy first\u201d will persuade the DPRK out of its nukes. Doomed to Succeed That is the wider context for understanding Suga\u2019s post-summit remark that he had a \u201cmeaningful debate\u201d with Biden about democracy, human rights, rule of law, and what the elements of a stable Sino-American relationship truly are. The Japanese are enlightened realists and disparage lighter-than-air idealists no less than \u201cAmerica first\u201d cynics. They are right to do so. Most US-Japanese summits are doomed to succeed. Both sides need them to succeed for political reasons, and if palpable deliverables cannot be arranged, words must suffice. We thus got no significant advance in coordinating US-Japanese naval command- and-control capabilities, nor any new joint forum acknowledging Japan as a co-equal security policy development partner. We did get agreement that no blue sky would show between US and Japanese strategic priorities \u2500 so, for example, no missile deal with North Korea leaving out short-range rockets that can reach Japanese but not US soil. In sum, we got modest advances in the evolution of greater Japanese security responsibility in a widening geographical orbit. That\u2019s all to the good, Suga sweet \u2500 for the US-Japan relationship is the linchpin for the entire Indo-Asian security network. It is not without major import for every Asian nation desirous of an open and free Indo- Pacific region. Now comes the hard work: concretising dulcet words into concrete achievements."

    "title": "Towards ICCS 2022 Cohesive Societies, Shared Humanity: Looking Back, Moving Forward",
    "author(s)": "By Norman Vasu",
    "date": "No. 102 \u2013 1 July 2021",
    "content": "to explore the theme. DIVERSITY OF faiths and traditions, of ethnicities and identities, and of ideas and throughout human history. While maintaining peaceful perspectives exists intercommunal relations can be challenging for diverse societies, understanding and accepting diversity allows for the flourishing of harmonious co-existence. In Southeast Asia, the Malacca Sultanate in the Malay Peninsula of the 15th century is a sterling example of well-managed societal diversity. The Muslim rulers of Malacca welcomed peoples of all backgrounds and religions to live and work peacefully in their territories, and many of them inter-married and exchanged cultures. The rich heritage of the Peranakan and the Chetti Melaka communities in Malaysia and Singapore as well as parts of Indonesia are the legacies of these marital unions. Religion as a Force for Good Today, the global community faces significant challenges as competitive dynamics across a wide spectrum emerge to dominate human and socio-cultural development, international relations, and economic and technological advancement.  Within this competitive context, it often seems that there is an increasing exclusion of the \u201cother\u201d and violent attacks have been perpetuated against those who are different. The inaugural International Conference on Cohesive Societies (ICCS) hosted by Singapore in June 2019 brought together 1,100 academics, government officials, representatives of religious organisations and groups, and members of civil society from 40 countries to reiterate the imperative of continuing dialogue, mutual learning, and co-existence for a secure future. The maiden ICCS pushed against the misleading causal narrative that religious differences are either a necessary or sufficient condition for conflict and sought to not miss the forest for the trees \u2013 religions can and do work together for the betterment of all of society. Looking Back: Faith, Identity & Cohesion ICCS discussions were divided into three broad themes: faith; identity; and cohesion. First, through the lens of faith, it was established that what ultimately unites all religions is the acknowledgement of the fragility of the human condition and the need to care for the other (otherwise known as the Golden Rule). Human beings, regardless of cultural traditions and religious beliefs share the same desires and aspirations: safety, a sense of community, and belonging. Second, through the theme of identity, the dangers of operating with stereotypes and a monolithic group identity were highlighted. The loudest most extreme fringe should not be treated as representative of any community. Intra-communal and intra-religious differences are the norm, and the majority in each population is more moderate than the minority. Third, by discussing cohesion, there was broad consensus that the goal of social cohesion requires all of society to work together. Social cohesion will not be achieved either solely through a top-down governmental approach or will it be accomplished purely via the energy of the grassroots. Moreover, and importantly, it was established that there is no terminus for a state of social cohesion \u2013 it is a constant work in progress. Looking Forward: The Elephant in the Room With these take-aways from the first ICCS, there is a need to address the big elephant in the room: how does a global conference on the nexus between religion and social cohesion contribute further to the collective responsibility in calming and conciliating conflicted situations without going over familiar ground? The widening of diversity in every social form represented at the 2019 ICCS is the key to avoiding it being another stop on the inter-religious circuit where the converted are preached to. To modify a particular parlance of our times, the need here is to \u201cgo wide or go home\u201d. The sharing of more diverse experiences, challenges, ideas, and solutions is undoubtedly the manner further utility may be attained from such a conference as entrenched positions are transferability of solutions discovered, and commonality uncovered. jolted, Diversity, often derided as a liability for organisations and communities, is instead a strength. As seen in the boardrooms of multinational companies and in governance, the embrace and incorporation of diversity is an important strategy for success. The key is to manage the differences and innovate on the practical side at every level: put words into action; rely on the individual initiative. What is Diversity? Diversity here should not be understood purely as religious diversity. If the next conference is to build on what came before it, diversity should be understood in the broadest terms. This mindset should inform invitations for both participants and speakers alike. Furthermore, much can be gained the intersectionality of the lived experience. from appreciating For example, one is not merely a Catholic but may also be female and a refugee or a Muslim, male, and of a particular ethnicity or nationality. The youth, the digitally connected (that is, both the young and the senior citizens), the less privileged and the business entrepreneurs: everyone can play a part. The intersections of these very different but very real concurrently existing experiences cannot be ignored. There is also profit from discussing the diversity of challenges. While the world is currently experiencing the common challenge of COVID-19 pandemic, the other challenges posed by issues such as climate change, uneven economic development, poverty, the 4th Industrial Revolution, and racism, must be attended to. There is a transferability here on how different groups \u2013 religious or otherwise \u2013 respond to such challenges; success derived by working together on one issue may offer insight into how another issue may be tackled. Finally, the diversity of opinion on social media and the negative implications of individuals finding comfort in echo chambers is often seen as an unfortunate consequence of having a marketplace of ideas. However, this diversity should not be exclusively considered in a negative manner. Social media has been harnessed as a tool through which the better sharing of knowledge and the deepening of relationships can be realised. Thinking Through the Way Ahead How is success of another ICCS to be measured? The feedback from the participants of the inaugural ICCS provides a useful guide. Youth and civic groups are collaborating across borders and communities, individuals and organisations have continued their dialogues and mutual learning, and narratives online and in the traditional media have become more aware of the \u201cpotholes\u201d in the journey of shared humanity. Trust between groups is growing as a common purpose is being established. Putting the question another way, what is the detrimental effect of not having continuing dialogue? If talk and interaction do not worsen a situation, can keep the situation constant, or better it, there is little reason not to carry on carrying on. One of the many positives of the first ICCS was the ability for reflection: to think through the way ahead. One such essay at its crux emphasised how every individual has a role in maintaining social cohesion while another article stressed how diversity need not be divisive. The underlying spirit in these articulations is a commitment to a future in unity and mutual respect, not division and stereotypes."

    "title": "Global Health Security: COVID-19 & Its Impacts Early Warning Systems: Stumbling Blocks Post-Pandemic",
    "author(s)": "By Manoj Harjani",
    "date": "No. 122 \u2013 16 June 2020",
    "content": "FOR MANY countries, COVID-19 has been a strategic surprise \u2013 an unanticipated event rendering existing planning assumptions ineffective. The consequences of this have been severe, as many countries have struggled to contain infections and save lives. Despite what the speed and scale of COVID-19\u2019s impact suggest, pandemics are foreseeable, and countries have early warning systems to detect and respond to infectious disease outbreaks. Did these systems fail in the case of COVID-19? If they did not, what might explain the prevalence of strategic surprise? Failure to Detect or Failure to Respond? Following the 2003 SARS epidemic, China invested in a sophisticated early warning system for infectious diseases. While some media reports claim this system failed in the case of COVID-19, the realities of identifying a novel infectious disease are complex. China\u2019s early warning system may have been hampered by its reliance on case information obtained after diagnosis rather than analysis of pre-diagnosis risk factors. Furthermore, despite mandated reporting for pneumonia with unknown causes, it is unclear why cases were not surfaced through the early warning system during the COVID-19 outbreak\u2019s initial phase. In the United States, however, controversy arose over intelligence agencies\u2019 early warnings on COVID-19 apparently being ignored by President Trump. Media reports have also highlighted how the Trump administration cut funding for a pandemic early warning system in September 2019, just months before the COVID-19 outbreak. The Trump administration has not been alone, however, in reallocating resources away from pandemic preparedness \u2013 this despite consistent warnings for more than a decade about the significant risk posed. Questions of how much governments knew during the COVID-19 outbreak\u2019s early days are politically sensitive given the scale of the pandemic\u2019s impact. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has also been criticised for being slow to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. While these issues are underpinned by the efficacy of early warning systems, little attention has been given to why these systems did not create sufficient strategic awareness. Stumbling Blocks The elephant in the room is that an early warning system\u2019s effectiveness is closely linked to how those operating it and responding to its output perceive risk. This is problematic as an individual\u2019s perception of risk is inherently subjective. Everyone \u2013 including experts \u2013 is affected by cognitive biases that can create a gap between evidence of risk and how it is perceived. Risk perception gaps are important because they directly affect reaction time after a warning is communicated. Consider how Taiwan and Vietnam initially raised eyebrows when they implemented extensive control measures much earlier than other countries, but have since been praised for successfully containing COVID-19. Easily-disseminated mis- and disinformation have also made it particularly challenging to address risk perception gaps related to COVID-19. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus highlighted the problem\u2019s severity when he remarked that \u201cwe\u2019re not just fighting an epidemic; we\u2019re fighting an infodemic.\u201d This \u201cinfodemic\u201d also comes at a time when some global leaders have shown open distrust in and disregard for expert opinion. For example, Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro sparked outrage over a seemingly flippant response to his country\u2019s escalating spread of COVID-19. Warning fatigue is another issue that early warning systems must also contend with. Consistently issued warnings for an event that does not happen, or happens with a smaller than expected impact can shape future risk assessments \u2013 a case of \u201ccrying wolf\u201d. It is possible that the (mis)handling of previous pandemics affected risk perceptions of COVID-19. For example, the WHO was previously criticised for apparently overestimating the 2009 H1N1 pandemic\u2019s impact, and this may have in turn shaped its reaction to the COVID-19 outbreak. Prospects for Early Warning Systems Countries will likely apply lessons from epidemiological surveillance systems created during this pandemic to improve existing early warning systems or develop new ones. In particular, we can expect to see tighter integration with smart city infrastructure. South Korea\u2019s Epidemiological Investigation Support System, for example, is enabled by a common data platform originally developed in 2018 for the country\u2019s National Strategic Smart City R&D Programme. This was complemented by apps monitoring inbound travellers and those under quarantine, as well as detailed disclosure of information related to infected individuals\u2019 movements. However, technology-enabled surveillance comes with its own challenges. Concern is growing over potential surveillance creep, exemplified by China\u2019s use of digital health codes to control citizens\u2019 movements. Furthermore, the European Union\u2019s struggle to implement a region-wide contact tracing protocol has highlighted difficulties in finding a balance between respecting privacy and ensuring public safety. Need for Non-Invasive Methods To address this, countries may need to devote more attention to explore non-invasive data collection methods. Wastewater analysis has shown promise, and we may even see nationwide networks of sensors at public places to detect individuals with a fever, as well as those not wearing masks. It will nevertheless take more than leaning on technology to build strategic awareness for the long term. Countries will need to invest in minimising decision-makers\u2019 risk perception gaps, and regional cooperation platforms are well-placed to enable this. The ASEAN Plus Three Summit on COVID-19 took an important step in this direction by resolving to strengthen the region\u2019s early warning system. Regular interactions among officials through ASEAN meeting platforms and the shared experience of coping with this ongoing pandemic will also create more opportunities to narrow risk perception gaps."

    "content": "THE RECENT case of the Singaporean PhD student Dickson Yeo Jun Wei\u2019s intelligence gathering activities for the Chinese government, on his own admission in US court documents, has generated concerns regarding the potential risks in academic research, particularly if researchers are being cultivated for more sinister purposes. It also poses significant questions, for small countries in navigating big- power rivalries. To be sure, universities and think-tanks do not operate, purely, in an academic ivory tower and it is not entirely inconceivable that their researchers are being observed \u2013 even propositioned \u2013 by foreign intelligence agents. Targeting Singapore and Academia Indeed, it has been observed that China \u2013 in recent years \u2013 has attempted to further its political influence abroad through the cultivation of overseas ethnic Chinese, and Singapore as a Chinese-majority country has always been of interest to Beijing. Why is this so? One common refrain \u2013 particularly among Singapore academic and policy circles \u2013 is that because of its ethnic composition, Singapore is seen by Beijing as a country that can \u201cunderstand\u201d China better and thus play a useful interlocutor role between China and the West (which presumably does not understand China as well as Singapore)."

    "content": "COULD SINGAPORE, with its strategic foresight capability, have predicted COVID- 19? It is reasonable to ask this, since Singapore is admired globally for its strategic foresight capability. Two milestones stand out in the development of this capability. The first occurred in the mid-1980s, when the Government experimented with using long-term scenarios in defence planning and not long after rolled it out for broader use across the different ministries. This led to the practice of \u201cNational Scenarios\u201d that forms, at least partly, the basis for long-term planning. The second was a major review which in 2004 led to the Strategic Framework for Singapore\u2019s National Security. Swan, Elephant, or Something Else? Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for Security and Defence Dr Tony Tan\u2019s 2005 Ministerial Statement on the Framework observed that \u201cthe most important recommendation\u201d was to \u201cset up a new Coordinating Structure in the centre of Government\u2026in the Prime Minister's Office.\u201d Dr Tan, in highlighting the importance of investing in \u201cimaginative solutions to intractable problems\u201d, also announced the establishment of a Risk Assessment and Horizon Scanning capability intended \u201cto help us anticipate and deal with shocks to our system.\" The Risk Assessment and Horizon Scanning Programme Office was set up within NSCS, alongside the other strategic foresight apparatus of the Government such as the Centre for Strategic Futures in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. Returning to the question posed above: was COVID-19 inherently unpredictable? Was it a \u201cblack swan\u201d that would have defied the best foresight capability? Or was COVID- 19 a \u201cblack elephant\u201d, the sort of catastrophic problem identified in advance but ultimately ignored, sometimes wilfully? But maybe there is a third possibility \u0336 that catastrophic surprise is context specific: it is not simply that it is unforeseen and unforeseeable, but seems that way because of the limits imposed by one's perspective and experiences. Limits to Whole-of-Government Approach? Notwithstanding the lapse when it came to assessing the magnitude of risk to foreign worker dormitories, agencies have not been unprepared. They have for years been anticipating, and preparing for, disruptions to food security (through source diversification) and infectious diseases outbreaks (the opening of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases in 2019 being a case in point). Still, COVID-19 should give us pause: there is the opportunity to use this crisis, and do deep thinking on the our strategic foresight enterprise, and cognitive diversity within. A horizon scanning system, for example, combines data science and data analytics with the craft and intuition of the analyst, the scenario planner or the futurist, so that we can mitigate the failure of imagination and the lack of communication that allows people to feign ignorance and thereafter act surprised. A well-designed horizon scanning system is underpinned by Ashby\u2019s Law of Requisite Variety, encapsulated in the aphorism, \u201cit takes complexity to defeat complexity.\u201d To better able to intuit catastrophic surprises, it helps if we look in different directions, have different mental models, and are constantly and courageously challenging each other\u2019s interpretations of what is going on. So, could a horizon scanning system have foreseen COVID-19? Alas, probably not, and certainly not in its painful detail. But COVID-19 has shown that the best whole-of- government efforts must be enhanced. To be sure, centralising strategic foresight and horizon scanning capability within the Government, albeit with frequent consultations with outsiders, certainly makes for greater efficiency. Wisdom of the Crowds: Look Beyond Government But it also creates a single point of failure. To prevent this, we need to inject the requisite diversity of viewpoints and expertise necessary to detect and tackle emerging threats. Needless to say, this more distributed approach will have to trade off efficiency for robustness (and messiness). If complexity is required to defeat complexity, then the diversity of expertise, knowledge and insights that can help Singapore deal with these emerging threats may well come as much from outside of Government \u2013 from the usual quarters such as universities and think tanks, as well as unexpected ones such as NGOs and loving critics \u2013 as from within. In his 2004 \u201cThe Wisdom of Crowds\u201d, James Surowiecki suggested that, under certain conditions, a sufficiently diverse and independent group could produce more accurate forecasts and guesses than so-called experts. To mitigate that \u201csingle point of failure\u201d, the strategic foresight enterprise should be less of a \u201cGovernment-hub and different spokes\u201d model, and more of a decentralised network with diverse and independent nodes simultaneously complementing and countering each other in making sense of the world. This idea has been put into practice by various corporations and government agencies, in the form of hackathons, crowdsourcing for ideas, and prediction markets. There is a practical consideration. No matter how enlightened a government or organisation is, there is a limit to inconvenient albeit useful insights it is willing to accept, much less embrace, especially if surfaced internally. Moreover, an internal group established to counter groupthink can itself on occasion be susceptible to groupthink. By building capabilities outside of the Government or drawing on pre-existing ones, we can shift the cognitive odds in our favour even though the foresight enterprise remains a fallible one. National Security: Time for Review interpretations of ambiguous weak signals A distributed, extra-Government horizon scanning process provides a platform for multiple Incompatible interpretations of the same signal, far from causing consternation, are instructive: it tells you that it does not conform to any previous pattern, and we should pay it even more attention, instead of trying to force a convergence of views. to occur. This is where culture comes into play: we should further develop a culture that takes on board potentially useful albeit unpalatable insights surfaced by outsiders. We are now at a point where national security and strategic foresight need to encompass and embrace that emerging range of uncomfortable novelties: not just pandemics, but food security, climate change, and grey zone operations such as disinformation. Some 15 years ago, Singapore\u2019s national security enterprise placed resilience and whole-of-government coordination front and centre, and augmented its foresight capabilities with horizon scanning. Given how the world has changed because of COVID-19 (though not only because of it), another review may be in order, one that expands the national security discourse from one that is whole-of-government to whole-of-society, in order to tap the wisdom of the crowds."

    "title": "ASEAN Smart Cities: Balancing 5G and Geopolitics",
    "author(s)": "By Amalina Anuar",
    "date": "No. 079 \u2013 29 April 2020",
    "content": "The ASEAN Smart Cities Network (ASCN) is now in its second year running. Yet smart city goals, such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), have been overshadowed by concerns of geopolitical tensions \u2014 mainly due to the technologies, such as 5G, and standards of governance involved \u2014 and could require finetuning in a post- pandemic world. How have ASEAN\u2019s smart city ambitions progressed, and how can these hubs be smartened up going forward? As a next-generation technology critical to the connectivity-based and data-driven 4IR, the view is that those holding an edge over 5G will be in prime position to achieve technological, economic and military supremacy. Elephants Fighting The past year has thus seen bipartisan attempts from Washington to exclude Huawei and ZTE \u2014 and by extension, curtail Beijing\u2019s rising influence \u2014 from 5G networks on various grounds. These range from warnings of potential espionage and cybersecurity threats to criticism that supporting the \u201csinification of 5G\u201d is tantamount to democracy\u2019s death. Choosing sides, however, implies that there are credible options. Current sentiments suggest that the US is falling behind on offering an alternative. Beyond July 2019\u2019s inaugural US-ASEAN Smart City Partnership meeting, Washington has engaged the region mainly in terms of cybersecurity capacity building such as through the Digital Cooperation and Connectivity Partnership. Recently, US policymakers floated the Utilising Strategic Allied Telecommunications Act aimed at incentivising 5G production and innovation, along with a proposed US$500 million for the Multilateral Telecommunications Security Fund. Yet a lack of 5G options is not the only factor undercutting Washington\u2019s engagement on the smart city front. Whereas China is involved in 500 smart city projects globally, the US has faced domestic opposition in rolling out smart cities due to, among other things, health-driven radiation and privacy concerns \u2014 potentially making expertise in and implementation of a US smart city-model abroad less likely even as prospects of US-ASEAN smart city health solution cooperation were raised. The public-private partnerships underpinning US-ASEAN smart city cooperation may further complicate regional engagement: Washington cannot direct private sector financing to ASEAN or elsewhere, regardless of geopolitical imperatives. Elephant in the Room Conversely, excluding Vietnam, no other ASEAN member state has shut Huawei out of building national communication networks. Nonetheless, even Vietnam\u2019s Viettel has had few qualms partnering with Huawei via its subsidiaries to provide 5G options abroad, such as in neighbouring Cambodia. Yet smart cities are not simply reducible to 5G, just as digital economy developments are not influenced by major power rivalries alone. 5G is simply the foundation: it is the data analytics and use cases that will make or break ambitions to unlock prosperity in the digital age. Considering that Western and Japanese companies retain a comparative advantage in software critical to processes such as virtual network slicing, hegemony by any party is not yet a given. Seen sector-wise, moreover, the variation in technological providers comes to light across the smart city landscape. Japanese companies, for example, are particularly active in traffic management and transportation projects. Foothold in 5G aside, digital trade hubs by Chinese companies such as Alibaba are capitalising on smart cities as nodes of the digital economy. Both China and ASEAN have recently signalled further cooperation on the e- commerce front, in light of COVID-19. It remains to be seen, however, whether recent events will lead to a heavier healthcare focus in Chinese smart city technology exports, such as surveillance technologies for public health purposes. Protecting the Tribe Similarly lost in the fray of major power tensions are efforts undertaken by small states to keep the focus on development rather than geopolitics. A World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiating text on e-commerce rules, inclusive of data provisions, will not be available until June. In the absence of multilateral consensus, ASEAN has launched discussions on digital economy issues via the Framework for Digital Data Governance and its various forums, among others. Both a formal cybersecurity coordination mechanism and regulatory pilot space for cross-border data flows were also unveiled recently. Though ASEAN initiatives must be viewed objectively given the challenges of implementation, keeping digital trade conversations going remains a positive \u2014 as are steps to remove the more protectionist rules on data processing and storage within national borders. Whether this momentum can be maintained as COVID-19 draws attention and resources towards more immediate crisis management, however, remains to be seen. Grey Rhinos, White Elephants Certain issues should be kept in mind as the smart city train keeps rolling forward: chiefly, that participatory placemaking \u2014 or the collective reinvention of public spaces \u2014 and digital cultures may require more consideration. Urban spaces are changing and being changed by new ways and meanings of being connected through intersecting digital, political and socioeconomic networks. COVID-19 and its cures, such as social distancing measures, further spotlight a potential need to rethink hitherto density-focused urban management and remake public spaces in line with post-pandemic social norms. This, however, should be done without eliminating the connectivity and connections that make cities dynamic in the first place. Likewise, issues of data usage and sharing, as well as other digital rights could benefit from public discussion and deliberation alongside existing corporate lobbies such as the Asian Internet Coalition. The digital age raises several questions pertaining to, for instance, matters of authoritarian surveillance or surveillance capitalism, as well as agency to opt in or out of data collection via omnipresent technologies, whether during crises such as health pandemics or otherwise. Emphasising cybersecurity and cyber hygiene practices aside, ASEAN must move beyond a focus on technology availability to constructing digital institutions that address data fluency \u2014 i.e. the ability to collect, analyse, use and communicate data. Similarly, building a technology maintenance culture would provide stronger foundations for the emerging network of ASEAN Smart Cities and for transitions towards a more digitally reliant post-COVID-19 world. Without making these smart cities more navigable, convenient to use, and responsive in addressing on-the-ground needs, such projects may run the risk of turning into grey rhinos \u0336 or obvious but avoidable risks \u0336 and white elephants combined."

    "author(s)": "By Jose Ricardo Sto. Domingo",
    "date": "No. 039 \u2013 4 March 2021",
    "content": "IN DECEMBER 2020, Malaysia reported record-high COVID-19 cases in the thousands, prompting the government to announce the second Movement Control Order (MCO 2.0) within weeks, on 11 January 2021. A day later, the government declared a state of emergency. Malaysia had kept the pandemic relatively under control during its first two waves of COVID-19. It reached 2,552 active cases in April 2020, and gradually approached 200 by end June. Despite this, the third wave is Malaysia\u2019s fastest spreading and deadliest yet. The third wave comprised 96% of total reported cases since January 2020. Malaysia recorded an average of 2,913 daily cases for February 2021, and ranks third in total cases in ASEAN, behind Indonesia and the Philippines. The Sabah Factor While much has been discussed about the third wave being fuelled by the Sabah state election in September 2020, the state itself had already been struggling with cases within its immigrant detention centres. One of the largest clusters heading into the third wave was in a Lahad Datu detention centre (1,146 cases). Soon after, the virus found its way into foreign worker living quarters. The Teratai Cluster (7,189 cases) in Selangor is a group of dormitories under the Top Glove corporation. Notably, Selangor and Sabah have the largest number of documented migrants among the states of Malaysia. Based on data from the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM), Sabah was host to 1.1 million documented migrants and Selangor hosted 581,000 migrants. Sabah holds most of the country\u2019s oil palm plantations. while Selangor holds numerous factories and foreign worker dormitories for the manufacturing and construction sectors. What is difficult to capture are the undocumented migrants in Malaysia. A 2018 World Bank study estimated the range of undocumented migrants to be between 1.2 million and four million people, participating in vital Malaysian industries like manufacturing, construction, and agriculture. Export Economy, Foreign Labour & Vulnerable Migrants The government designed MCO 2.0 to allow for certain industries to continue operating. Despite this, domestic consumption, the main driver of the Malaysian economy, has been subdued under movement restrictions. Trade will be key for the economy for 2021, as stated by Bank Negara Malaysia, the central bank. Significantly, exports of palm oil were valued at RM72.8 billion (SGD23.9 billion) in 2020. Meanwhile, Malaysia\u2019s rubber gloves industry boomed during the pandemic due to rocketing demand for protective gear. Data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC) shows that between September 2019 to September 2020, Malaysia\u2019s rubber apparel exports grew by 159% and palm oil grew by 37%. Despite the imposition of SOPs meant to control the infection on permitted economic activities, many of the COVID-19 clusters reported were workplace-related, which included factories and plantations. On 20 February 2021, all 10 newly reported clusters were at workplaces. For foreign labourers who live in unsanitary dorms where social distancing is near impossible, the risk of infection is high. In December 2020, the Ministry of Human Resources revealed that 91% or 1.4 million foreign workers were not provided with housing compliant with minimum housing standards and amenities under Act 446. Rubber glove companies have gone under fire the past year for their alleged abusive working conditions and miserable housing. In the same month, a government raid closed a glove factory in Kuala Lumpur for housing 781 workers in stacks of shipping containers. Malaysia\u2019s immigration depots and prisons are also severely overcrowded. According to the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia, the country\u2019s prison system has a capacity of 53,830 people. By October 2020, total inmates were at 72,903. The Commission also estimated that immigration depots were at 20 percent over capacity. The living conditions and treatment of migrants reflect a common blind spot in national COVID-19 strategies. As of 23 February 2021, 37% (107,168 people) of Malaysia\u2019s reported positive cases are non-citizens. Early Warning Signs Early concerns were raised over Malaysia\u2019s immigrant population. Alarm bells had been sounded when countries like the United Arab Emirates, Thailand, and Singapore experienced infections among their own foreign worker populations. However, media reports suggest that the Malaysian government\u2019s actions then were primarily focused on detention and deportations and directed towards undocumented migrants. The government launched Ops Benteng (Ops Fortress) in May 2020 to secure the country\u2019s borders. It enhanced security along Malaysia\u2019s borders and increased arrests and detention of illegal immigrants, but government policies for managing arrested and documented migrants were mostly insufficient in preventing the spread of the virus during the third wave. More politicians have expressed concerns over the spread of the virus among migrants in recent months. The government launched an initiative to place foreign workers in hotels to provide better living conditions. Importantly, the government also announced the country\u2019s vaccine programme will include both documented and undocumented migrants. According to government estimates, the number of registered foreign workers in October 2020 was 1.6 million, or about 10% of the country\u2019s labour force. In 2019, the top sectors that hired workers were manufacturing (35.5% of foreign workers), construction (21.5%), and agriculture and plantations (21%). These industries contributed a combined 34.4% to Malaysian GDP in the fourth quarter of 2020. Long Term Issues Beyond COVID-19 Malaysia has long faced humanitarian, economic and security challenges when it comes to managing its migrants, but COVID-19 has amplified and exposed their direct effects for the whole society. As long as the country continues to rely on foreign labour, ensuring their safety and protection will be vital to securing Malaysia\u2019s society, public health and economy. More broadly, social responsibility and sustainability have recently become bigger issues in the global market. Malaysian rubber gloves from various producers have been placed under embargoes by the US Customs and Border Protection due to forced labour claims throughout the past year. Additionally, both Malaysian and Indonesian palm oil could potentially be phased out in the European Union due to sustainability issues. New practices that follow socially responsible and sustainable practices could become a focus for Malaysia to not only fix its domestic issues, but also adapt to the global economy. Over a month has passed since the imposition of MCO 2.0 and reported cases have begun to slowly decline. Some 18% fewer cases were reported in February versus January 2021, although asymptomatic contacts have stopped being tested since the end of January. Restrictions have been gradually eased in most states and Malaysia\u2019s vaccine roll-out also began on 24 February. As Malaysia and other countries begin to recover, their governments must also address the long-term issues that COVID-19 has highlighted."

    "author(s)": "By Nazneen Mohsina and Joseph Franco",
    "date": "No. 109 \u2013 3 June 2020",
    "content": "THE ASPERSION of Muslims in light of the COVID-19 pandemic plays into the majoritarian politics and anti-Muslim narrative that has been on the rise since the Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s (BJP) accession to power in 2014 and re-election in 2019. The \u2018othering\u2019 of Muslims \u2500 portraying them as different \u2500 is an integral part of the BJP\u2019s strategy to stay in power and push its agenda of creating a unitarian nation based on a religio-cultural identity. The current hate-campaign against Muslims could also be a tactic to deflect public anger from the government's failings in managing the COVID-19 crisis. Worsening Muslim Marginalisation The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pursued Hindu primacy and ultra-nationalism, shifting the country away from its founding ideals of secularism and equality. Since the re-emergence of Hindu nationalism, right-wing hardliners have become marginalisation of Indian Muslims. increasingly emboldened in promoting Hindu dominance and the Prior to the pandemic, communal tensions were already intense due to the recently enacted Citizenship Amendment Act of 2019 that discriminated against Muslims, generating nationwide protests. In February, India witnessed its worst violence between Hindus and Muslims in decades. Indian Muslims now appear to face an additional layer of marginalisation since government officials and various media outlets accredited an Islamic seminary by Tabligh Jamaat as the main transmitter of the coronavirus. This, along with multiple other fake news and conspiracy theories accusing Muslims of deliberately conducting a malevolent campaign to spread COVID-19 to the Hindu majority, has resulted in demonisation, denial of medical care, boycotts, and attacks on Muslims in the country. Tabligh Jamaat Congregation and its Effect The Tabligh Jamaat, an Islamic missionary group, held its annual meeting at its Delhi headquarters in early March before India declared a health emergency and called for a national lockdown. The event was attended by over 2,000 people, including foreign nationals from countries with active COVID-19 cases. There have been reports linking participants to over 1,000 coronavirus cases across India. While the meeting admittedly was ill-timed owing to the pandemic, anti-Muslim critics exploited the event for their own narrative. Muslims were painted as the sole culprits responsible for transmitting the coronavirus in India even though other political and religious functions were taking place with no restrictions imposed by the government until late March. Critics also pointed that Tabligh-linked positive cases were high because attendees were selectively tested. The subsequent dissemination of explicit content portraying Muslims as the key vector of the COVID-19 virus on television channels, social media and from members of the BJP, worsened Muslim demonisation and Islamophobia. Television debates created \u201cus-vs-them\u201d narratives, and called them \u201ccorona villains\u201d, \u201cenemies of the nation\u201d and \u201chuman bombs\u201d, among other prejudicial terms. Hashtags like #CoronaJihad, #BioJihad, #Coronaterrorism, #MuslimsSpreadingCorona began circulating online. The anti-Muslim drive was also endorsed by members of the BJP. The union minority affairs minister in Modi\u2019s cabinet took up the \u201cCorona jihad\u201d phrase, calling the gathering by the Tablighi Jamaat a \u201cTalibani crime\u201d. Numerous fake videos linking Indian Muslims with the spread of COVID-19, accusing them of purposely spitting, licking or sneezing on food, went viral on Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok. Islamophobia as a Tactic Crises can bring out new expressions of old prejudices. The spread of COVID-19- related hate speech has amplified existing biases, exacerbated Islamophobia and contributed to an upsurge in anti-Muslim hate crimes. For some governments, channelling public anger towards internal or external enemies is a way of diverting attention from their own failures. As it had not considered the virus a threat to India until much later, the government did not prepare any contingency plan to cope with it. Additionally, the sudden way in which it declared a nationwide lockdown added to the host of unanticipated problems, including the exodus of migrant labour. Human Rights Watch has expressed concern over rising Islamophobia in India. Correspondingly, India has also been attracting international criticism. Most recently, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom urged the State Department to designate India as a \"country of particular concern\" over \"severe violations\" of religious freedom \u2013 the worst India has fared since 2004. Similarly, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the Kuwait government, a royal princess of the United Arab Emirates, as well as a number of Arab activists, many of whom are India\u2019s strategic and trade partners, have expressed deep concern over Islamophobic hate speech by Indians that accused the country's Muslims of spreading the coronavirus. Numerous Indian expats in the Gulf region, Canada and New Zealand have consequently lost their jobs or have been charged for their Islamophobic social media posts. Implications of Vilification The vilification of Muslims propelled by media coverage and tacitly or directly endorsed by members of the ruling party could have far-reaching consequences. Firstly, it will threaten India\u2019s fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. If unchecked, it will also intensify religious discrimination and alienation of Muslim communities. That in turn will be problematic for India\u2019s national security as it will strengthen narratives of Islamist terrorist groups who may exploit sectarian and communal fault lines. Indeed, both Al-Qaeda and ISIS have intensified their propaganda campaign vis-\u00e0-vis India lately. Additionally, such vilification of Muslims will call into question India\u2019s vibrant, pluralistic heritage bound together by a Constitution that accords equal rights to all individuals and group \u2500 which has been the hallmark of the largest democracy in the world since independence. India cannot become a great power if its ruling party is an active participant in communal conflict within its borders. If India is to uphold its reputation, it is necessary to assure both its citizens and the international community that it is not retreating from its constitutional moorings by ensuring harmony and effective action against anyone who disturb it, irrespective of their political affiliations."

    "title": "Portugal: Stuck Between Two Giants",
    "author(s)": "By Loro Horta",
    "date": "No. 097 \u2013 22 June 2021",
    "content": "PORTUGAL PRIDES itself in being the first European nation to establish a permanent trading post in China when it founded Macau in 1557. Returning it to China only in 1999, the Portuguese proudly say that they are \u201cthe first in China and the last to leave\u201d. In the past decade or so, it is China that has come to Portugal, and in a big way. When the 2008 financial crisis caused the Portuguese economy to crash, Chinese investors began to invest in Portugal heavily. Lisbon was eager to attract foreign investment to save its state-owned companies in strategic sectors such as water, power and telecommunications and China was well-placed to provide it. Chinese Investment Flows into Portugal In 2011 China Three Gorges (CTG) bought a 21 percent stake in EDP, Portugal\u2019s state- owned power company for 2.7 billion euros. In 2012 CTG invested a further 359 million euros by acquiring 49 percent of EDP\u2019s subsidiary EDP Renewables. In the same year, China State Grid bought a 25 percent stake in REN, another Portuguese state-owned power company for 397 million euros. Chinese companies have also invested heavily in Portugal\u2019s struggling financial sector. Fosun International bought a 27 percent stake in Millennium Bank, Portugal\u2019s largest bank for 1.2 billion euros. In 2014 Fosun bought Fidelidade, the country\u2019s largest insurance company for one billion euros. In the same year Fosun invested a further 460 million euros when it bought Luz Saude, Portugal\u2019s largest health care provider. In 2018 China was the biggest investor in Portugal with over 10 billion euros in investment. Both nations seemed quite satisfied with the course of their relations which they hailed as mutually beneficial. Portugal was cash-strapped and desperate for investment while China had huge reserves of capital looking for new markets. American Eagle Looks On Warily Portugal is an old American ally, a founding member of NATO and has hosted a US air base for decades. Initially Washington did not pay much attention to Beijing\u2019s growing presence in Portugal. However, the election of Donald Trump in 2016 changed this. As tensions between the US and China degenerated into a full-fledged commercial war, Washington began to grow more critical of Lisbon\u2019s close ties with China. Matters came to a head when in 2020 Portugal accepted a Chinese proposal to modernise and expand the port of Sines, the country\u2019s most important harbour. Under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) China proposed a 640 million euro container terminal at Sines to transform it into a major shipping hub between Europe and the Americas. Unfortunately for small Portugal the Chinese proposal angered the Americans. In no uncertain terms, the US ambassador to Portugal George Glass, told the Portuguese government that Lisbon needed to rethink its relations with Beijing. In an interview with Expresso newspaper in September 2020, Ambassador Glass criticised in strategic sectors such as investment Portugal telecommunications and power. for allowing Chinese The US ambassador warned of serious consequences for the two countries\u2019 security relations if Huawei was allowed to enter the country\u2019s 5G market. Saving his toughest criticism for the possibility of Chinese investment in the Sines port, Glass warned: \u201cPortugal must choose between the United States or China\u201d. Portugal\u2019s Sines Port: Singapore of the West? In recent years the port of Sines has been growing in importance for the US. Sines is the closest point in Europe to the US east coast. The US plans to build a major natural gas terminal at Sines. The US is a major producer of natural gas and intends to use Sines to export it to its European Union allies. The liquefied natural gas (LNG) would be sold to the EU via pipelines linking various countries to Sines. This would open a large market for US LNG and diminish the dependence of EU members on Russian gas. Ambassador Glass said that the American alternative project would transform Portugal into the Singapore of the West. The Portuguese authorities pushed back at Glass\u2019 comments and denounce American meddling in the internal affairs of a sovereign country. Lisbon stated that it remained a firm ally of the US and that its ties with China are based on economic interests. Portugal would most certainly prefer to have both the American and Chinese projects at Sines. China does not seem to have any objections to such a possibility. However, Washington has made clear that Lisbon must choose. The new Biden administration, while having a more polite posture, is unlikely to change this stance. US Sticks Won\u2019t Work As tensions between China and the US escalate, small countries, even old American allies, will increasingly come under pressure to choose sides. While the US may have some legitimate concerns over Chinese investment in Portugal\u2019s 5G network, its criticism of other Chinese investments is controversial, if not dubious. China invested in Portugal at a time when no one was willing to do so. Unfortunately, Portugal has been caught between two giants. Whatever choice it makes will have profound consequences. The case of Portugal shows that when unable to compete with China on the economic front, the US would not hesitate to use threats. From Panama to Portugal this tactic is becoming more common. However, sticks alone are unlikely to work. Washington needs to offer more carrots."

    "title": "Western Isolation of Russia: Weakening?",
    "author(s)": "By Christopher Cheang",
    "date": "No. 101 \u2013 28 June 2021",
    "content": "OVER THE last few years, Germany and France, the European Union\u2019s two most powerful countries, have been consistently advocating for a dialogue with Russia, despite the Crimean annexation and Russia\u2019s support of Ukraine\u2019s separatist regions. Germany has its own reasons, partly historical going back to memories of last world war, but mainly economic. Germany is Russia\u2019s largest trade partner, after China. There are reportedly almost 4,000 German companies in Russia. France, on the other hand, views the rise of China in the context of geopolitics. The French prefer to keep EU relations with Russia on an even keel so as not to push it closer towards China. German and French Calculations Germany remains a keen and major consumer of Russian energy, as illustrated by Berlin\u2019s strong support of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, despite massive US pressure to stop the completion of its construction. Historically, the memory of Operation Barbarossa in 1941 and its brutal consequences on the USSR as well as Nazi Germany\u2019s defeat are etched into the consciousness of Berlin\u2019s leaders. Germany was split into two countries \u2014 the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) allied with the West and the German Democratic Republic (GDR) which was a member of the Soviet bloc. Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Vladimir Putin reportedly spoke to each other on the telephone on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of Operation Barbarossa. Russia\u2019s massive annual celebrations of Victory Day on 9 May 2021 also serves to unwittingly remind Germany of its responsibility in the conflict. France\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron, on the other hand, believes the rise of China is a challenge for the EU which the EU would find it difficult to master, if its relations with Russia remain strained. Hence, both Germany and France have not been too keen on granting Ukraine membership in NATO, which Russia has consistently warned against. In short, the EU\u2019s two most powerful members are keen to maintain a dialogue with Russia. EU Summit 24-25 June Last week\u2019s EU Summit in Brussels discussed its relations with Russia, among other issues. Reportedly, and not surprisingly, the Baltic states and Poland were not keen on Merkel/Macron\u2019s proposal to have a summit with the Russian president. Their suspicions and distrust of Russia remain entrenched, given their tortured history. There has not been a summit with Russia since the events of 2014 in Ukraine. Nevertheless, unanimity towards Russia was seen in the EU Summit\u2019s call on Russia \u201cto demonstrate a more constructive engagement and political commitment and stop actions against the EU and its member states, as well as against third countries\u201d. The EU member states also stressed the need \u201cfor a firm and coordinated response\u201d to \u201cany further malign, illegal and disruptive activity by Russia\u201d and \u201cfor additional restrictive measures, including economic sanctions\u201d to be considered. At the same time, they reiterated their \u201copenness to selective engagement with Russia in areas of EU interest\u201d; these included \u201cconcrete options on topics such as climate and the environment, health, as well as selected issues of foreign and security policy and multilateral issues\u201d. The Summit also criticised Russia\u2019s human rights situation. Intertwined Interests The unity displayed at the Summit towards Russia does not change the fact that the EU\u2019s two most powerful countries are not comfortable with the prevailing state of relations with Russia. If they persist, it might be a question of time before their views could prevail and eventually become EU policy. Russia has therefore shown more interest in developing bilateral relations with the EU member states, especially Germany and France. Merkel\u2019s departure from the political scene in September is not likely to change Germany\u2019s stance towards Russia; her successor, Armin Laschet, is believed to share her views on Russia and the need to maintain a dialogue with Moscow. Unlike the USSR, Russia is integrated into the global economic system and the EU economy. Geopolitically, its role has become more important to the West in balancing a rising China, which NATO recently declared a challenge that it had to address. Moreover, the EU cannot ignore the relatively large Russian market. Concern Over Open Conflict Global Issues of common interest like climate change, terrorism, the pandemic, and regional issues like Syria, Libya, Iran and Afghanistan (in the aftermath of the pending Western military pullout) cannot be fully or even partially resolved without Russia\u2019s cooperation. Perhaps concern about the possibility of an open conflict is another factor accounting for the German-French proposal, given the Russian military build-up on its border with Ukraine a few months ago and the recent incident between Russian naval forces and a Royal Navy vessel in the Black Sea. Finally, there is the realisation that President Putin\u2019s power has not and will not be adversely affected by the non-parliamentary opposition especially that of a movement led by Alexei Navalny. Of late, the authorities have moved to ban his movement. Moreover, in an effort to revive the political fortunes of the ruling United Russia (UR), President Putin suggested at its 19 June congress that Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov be added to the party\u2019s candidate list for the September parliamentary elections. He described \u201cpolitical heavyweights\u201d. them as Dialogue with Russia: Easing of Western Isolation? While UR is the country\u2019s dominant party, and is considered Putin\u2019s power base, recent polls suggest that its support is waning. Putin\u2019s support of UR and vice versa as well as its long affiliation with him also mean that UR\u2019s electoral performance in September will be interpreted as a reflection of his popularity. Both Shoigu and Lavrov are considered popular, the majority of Russians being supportive of a strong military and resolute foreign policy which these two men represent; therefore, UR stands to benefit from their candidatures. For good measure, Putin also announced spending on infrastructure, education and health, in the realisation that these popular candidates for UR are not an iron-clad guarantee for its electoral success. In any event, the EU is realistic enough to conclude that since Putin is likely to be in charge of Russia till possibly 2036, there might not be any other alternative but to conduct a pragmatic yet determined policy towards Russia. A crucial part of that policy includes maintaining a dialogue with the country\u2019s most powerful man."

    "title": "Digital Taxes: Multilateral Breakthrough or Falling Through?",
    "author(s)": "By Amalina Anuar",
    "date": "No. 193 \u2013 6 November 2020",
    "content": "COVID-19 IS catapulting the digital economy to the fore. Strained state finances, and a booming digital economy amidst social distancing and accelerating connectivity, spotlight the potential of taxing this growing pie. Negotiations for a multilateral tax treaty are ongoing in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s (OECD) even as the pandemic diverts political energy and provides pretext for delay. Can countries cobble together a consensus, and in what ways will agreement be meaningful? State of Play Originally slated for a December 2020 deadline, the OECD\u2019s Inclusive Framework now aims to lock in by mid-2021 global guidelines on taxing multinational enterprises (MNEs) that meet a tentative revenue floor of 750 million euros. Pillar One of the Framework would create rules for taxing digitally-enabled businesses that so far pay lower rates, despite a significant economic presence, because they do not have a permanent establishment in host economies. Pillar Two, meanwhile, would introduce a minimum tax on MNEs. The Framework\u2019s significance is manifold. First, it reflects a longstanding debate over tax sovereignty: states lose out on an estimated US$200 billion per year to tax havens, and have struggled with taxing digital businesses. Second, it would be an additional revenue stream in the digital economy, considering that the World Trade Organisation\u2019s e-commerce moratorium prohibits tariffs on electronic goods, and could contribute to domestic resource mobilisation (Sustainable Development Goal 17.1). In providing some relief to governments, it could ideally mitigate attempts to squeeze revenue from elsewhere, such as increased inspections further straining international trade. Third, sans consensus, the levying of potentially discriminatory unilateral taxes leaves the door open for disputes. This may prompt retaliatory weaponisation of economic relationships, such as trade, in a global economy already suffering from a short supply of stability and certainty. Breakthrough or Falling Through? With much riding on the line, can there be a global consensus? international Familiar challenges beset a resolution. COVID-19 is both fillip and obstacle. As with many informal conversations necessary for diplomacy. Multiple interests, moreover, are a hallmark of multilateral agreements. The Inclusive Framework is no different. fora, virtual summitry falls short facilitating in Disagreement arises over scope. It is unclear what MNEs are covered by the Framework. While originally designed to target digital giants, this mainly entailed taxing US MNEs besides a handful of Chinese and European firms \u2014 a move Washington decried as discriminatory, despite these MNEs being affected on grounds of being the main beneficiaries of the current rules-based economic system rather than citizenship. Since then, consumer-facing businesses have been added to the list. There is also debate over whether the Framework should be mandatory. In December 2019, the Trump administration advocated for a Safe Harbour proposal, which would allow firms to voluntarily opt-in for Pillar One. It is not, however, all doom and gloom. Businesses are willing to comply with a global framework in lieu of a regulatory noodle bowl. Much resistance is concentrated on Pillar One (taxing digitally-enabled businesses), but both the US and developing countries, which usually champion precautionary digital rule-making, have generally approved of implementing Pillar Two (introducing minimum taxes on MNEs) first. the OECD\u2019s recent economic Yet while that governments may accrue more fiscal revenue through Pillar Two, many states are pushing for a concurrent advance. Pillar Two alone will not reallocate taxing rights in a digital age. In this sense, it perhaps only partially reflects broader contestations over the spoils of the digital economy. impact assessment suggests Security Taxing Multilateralism To some extent, the digital economy is modifying the interests of different political- economic factions, but also historically like-minded countries such as the OECD membership. Digital taxes are a bone of contention in the US-European Union relations. Europe is now a source, rather than beneficiary, of rents or unearned profits. Just as Washington under Trump opposes the taxing of its MNEs, which might cut into R&D funding and hence its technological edge, it is in Europe\u2019s interest to impose them. Seen in this light, the Trump administration\u2019s decision to abandon negotiations in June is perhaps unsurprising. Some place high hopes for a reversal of fortunes following the US\u2019 November presidential election, which is still hanging in the balance at this time of writing. Yet bipartisan consensus and differences with like-minded allies on digital taxes harks back even to the Obama era. It remains to be seen whether a Biden White House augurs well for consensus, even if it could put greater multilateral involvement back on the cards. Moreover, how much reliability and certainty can a rules-based order proffer if members selectively follow the rules? Heightened national security concerns call into question the meaningfulness of any potential consensus, given a mindset shift in Washington over a fading liberal economic order and threatened American exceptionalism. This is on top of other security concerns which might blunt the Framework\u2019s implementation. For one, it is not clear how tax incentives will impact effective tax rates and hence revenues gained from the Framework; governments see them as a way of attracting investment and protecting economic security. For another, levying these taxes can depend on exchange of information between jurisdictions. Yet requests for data can be and are rejected on grounds of data insecurity or poor privacy and civil liberty laws. This lack of capacity could disproportionately affect less developed countries in greater need of tax justice. Way Forward: Reframe Global Negotiations? Overall, countries could go it alone in the event of talks breaking down. Digital value- added taxes toe legal lines, for instance. But this may be politically tone deaf in a post- COVID world where economic inequalities are front and centre \u2014 although corporate income taxes do not negate the odds of costs being passed on to smaller businesses and consumers regardless. Alternatively, agreement without the US would be defanged considering the market share of American firms and Washington\u2019s capacity for inflicting punitive measures. Forging a consensus will hence be no easy feat, but necessary. It may require treating digital taxes as part of a broader rather than standalone agreement, with compromises on this front being traded for concessions on digital trade. To that end, putting the national security genie back in the bottle to de-escalate tensions and reframe negotiations will be a critical first step. Still, only time will tell how other spectres of insecurity \u2014 whether economic or data-based \u2014 might hinder the realisation of a more sustainable global economic system, or a significant shift in power between states and markets overall."

    "title": "Biden as Host: US Politics of Climate Summitry",
    "author(s)": "By Adam Garfinkle",
    "date": "No. 080 \u2013 17 May 2021",
    "content": "is increasingly polarised between GLOBAL POLITICS forms of Caesarist authoritarianism and forms of liberal democracy, with many Asian countries stuck somewhere between the poles defined in common perception by China and America. Polarisation exists as well within the liberal-democratic world between forms of hyper- nationalist populism and traditional rule-of-law constitutionalism, especially in the United States. Moreover, a subtler form of polarisation exists within the US Democratic Party between centrists and \u201cwoke\u201d or \u201cprogressive\u201d Democrats who, in a European context, would be indistinguishable from democratic socialists. The interconnectedness of the three levels forces President Joe Biden to conduct a three-dimensional juggling act: US Domestic Politics & Biden\u2019s 3-D Juggling Act Biden\u2019s domestic political act juggles the following three fronts: On the global stage to manage relations among allies so to deal effectively with adversaries; on the national stage lest failure enable regression to a Trumpist America come 2022 and 2024; and within his own party, lest the opposition to his Left feed raw meat to the Republicans and complicate relations abroad. Policy and politics have never been entirely separate in America, but these days no blue sky separates the two. Politics is primary on both the domestic and international levels: lose these political games, both increasingly conceptualised as existential and zero-sum, and pondering fine points of policy becomes moot. Environmental policy is a key case in point, as preparations for and reactions to the US-led Climate Summit of April 22-23 illustrate. \u201cClimate change\u201d has become irremediably politicised within the United States in recent years, which is no surprise: After all, if mask-wearing in a pandemic can be politicised, anything can. The Democratic Party, fairly characterised since the mid-1990s as a coalition weighted towards culture-war activists, now ranks \u201cclimate change\u201d as the pre-eminent litmus test of ideological fidelity within the party. As part of the secular catechism of the Left, it inevitably elicits howls of derision and counter-mobilisation on the Right; the clickbait- oriented American commercial electronic media magnifies the clash to deafening levels, leaving the majority of centrist and sensible Americans bewildered, frustrated, and alienated from the political system. Biden the Consummate Politician Biden, the consummate political man, understands this. He must pay deference to the \u201cclimate change\u201d church in his own party or lose the ability to manage his Left flank. But he dare not lurch into apocalyptical language or his critical effort to win back working-class white support for the Democrats will be doomed. He judges that focusing the optic on environmental issues, but without going over-the-top rhetorically, will play well in national politics. And he knows that climate issues resonate loudly among most US allies, especially in Europe, and therefore become an adhesive to greater cooperation and restored US prestige as Washington works out how to lead the West against an increasingly leverage-rich and assertive China. That understanding explains how we ended up with a 40-nation \u201cvirtual-in-the-time-of- COVID\u201d Climate Summit within the Biden administration\u2019s first hundred days. Most relevant assistant secretaries and their deputies have yet to find their desks, substantive policy reviews can only barely have begun, and the sherpas could not possibly have readied actual deliverables for a major international summit \u2014 but it mattered not. In politically saturated circumstances, public relations optics overwhelm evolving policy substance. The performance had to be staged and staged soon, lest anyone think Biden\u2019s a \u201ccaretaker\u201d administration with no bandwidth for foreign policy. And so it was. The Climate Summit The Summit did the trick where it mattered most: domestically. Biden\u2019s dramatic, ante- upping Summit declaration that the US will halve its CO2 output by 2030 occasioned a politically ideal schizophrenic reaction. End-of-world type environmentalists now believe that Biden, his return to Paris, his Summit and his pledge, are the best things since the invention of tofu. Rightwing GOP loons have claimed it is part of the \u201csocialist\u201d globalist plot to destroy freedom and enslave non-\u201cethnic\u201d Americans, all perpetrated by a \u201cfake president\u201d who did not really win the election. They have said so to general embarrassment as far as most Americans are concerned. Neither skein of irrationalism seems to know or care that US emissions have been on a declining trajectory anyway because of relative de-industrialisation, the market- driven substitution of less-polluting energy sources, and demographic trends. Getting to \u201chalf\u201d by 2030 may or may not be achieved, but it is not that far-fetched a target. Out of range of Summit klieg lights, the administration actually has a real, substantive policy forming to deal with emissions and environment. It is called respectively ARPA- C, based on an organisation called ARPA-E created in 2007, which in turn was modelled on DARPA, the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency. If the US achieves Biden\u2019s 2030 goal, it will be because these plans for innovation get funded properly and work, not because of US re-accession to the Paris Treaty or late April\u2019s virtual-photo-op Summit. The International Fallout: Summit a Flop? On the global level, the Summit was a flop. No new pledges on carbon emissions came from Australia, India, Indonesia, Mexico, or Russia. If these and other countries intend new pledges they are saving them for the UN\u2019s November Glasgow climate meeting. Most developing something between disappointment and derision at the US financial assistance offered them, scored by experts as a tiny fraction of what agreed Paris targets require. countries, meanwhile, expressed But that was inevitable: Washington policymakers have known since the Kyoto Accords era that little of the US money turned over to poorer countries for emissions abatement would be spent as pledged. That disconnect was a political annoyance in the past; now it\u2019s downright toxic at a time of domestic economic uncertainty. Now nearly all seemingly foreign policy initiatives bearing a price tag are linked to US domestic policy preferences. That\u2019s how the Democrats would torque the Federal budget to do what they desire but draw less political drag against it. Here, however, lies opportunity for Singapore in the form of R&D fusion cells with the US on energy and climate innovation. Offices in Washington are brimming with new labels, but little substance: The first contributors who knock on the door with something practical in hand are almost guaranteed a warm and enriching welcome. Implications for Southeast Asia The broader regional implications of the Summit for Southeast Asia are close to nil \u2014 and that\u2019s because of China\u2019s reaction to it. Xi Jinping \u201cattended\u201d the Summit and, as is his wont with US presidents, made a series of doubtful statements. He admitted that China is still building new coal-fired plants but claimed that China\u2019s emissions will peak in 2030, and achieve net-zero emissions by 2060; this is a target so far away that merely stating it illustrates its propagandistic origin. Coal, he promised, will \u201cphase down\u201d after 2025 \u2014 even though the operational life of newly constructed plants will extend long after that. Even if China\u2019s emissions increase for only nine more years to 2030, it will dwarf the 50% reductions the US and the EU combined may achieve by then. Meanwhile, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi chided from the side, in Wolf Warrior cadence, the US return to Paris as a case of a returned \u201ctruant\u201d. He added linkage: Chinese cooperation over climate depended on the US attitude toward Beijing\u2019s policies toward Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Xinjiang. He did not mention the South China Sea; he did not have to. None of this bothered former Secretary of State John Kerry, now Biden\u2019s climate policy czar who used his stature and high-powered rolodex to arrange the Summit quickly, and took the lead in dizzying the media with post-Summit spin. The day after adjournment Kerry smiled and pronounced the Summit a good first step, toward more diplomacy. More important, the underwhelming achievement of the Summit did not seem to bother the powerful activiste environmental rump inside the Democratic Party. To the extent they even noticed the generally paltry international harvest, and particularly the acerbic Chinese response, it just made China a more deplorable \u201cbad guy\u201d. That\u2019s good politics, too. Nice juggling, Joe."

    "title": "Southeast Asia\u2019s Maritime Security Japan Sails Into New Territory",
    "author(s)": "By John Bradford",
    "date": "No. 209 \u2013 17 December 2020",
    "content": "JAPAN HAS quietly crossed into new policy territory in its support for Southeast Asia\u2019s maritime security. In 2020, Japan began engaging in the full range of peacetime security activities in Southeast Asia normally done by other nations. The most significant breakthrough involved the first-ever sale of a lethal defence system. The Japanese government will remain politically constrained by domestic anti- militaristic sentiments and can be expected to continue to show self-restraint as it carefully pursues a balanced strategy to support a free and open Indo-Pacific. However, Tokyo policymakers are no longer strictly limited by past interpretations of Japan\u2019s Post-World War II \u201cPeace Constitution\u201d nor the narrow definitions of \u2018defence\u2019 established by its leaders during the Cold War. Exporting Japan\u2019s New Defence System Today, the Japan Self-Defence Force (JSDF) regularly operates in Southeast Asian waters and engages with regional militaries in the full spectrum of cooperation. The key precedent was set in August 2020 when the Philippines purchased four Mitsubishi Electric Corporation air surveillance radars. The deal represents the first overseas transfer of a newly manufactured Japanese defence system. Prior to this, Japan\u2019s defence equipment exports had been limited to spare parts and non-lethal systems such as unarmed patrol boats and hand-me-down training aircraft. The new radars will be used to monitor the strategic airspace around the Philippines, including that above the South China Sea. With their fire control quality data, these systems will be an important element to the new \u201cfix\u2192 track\u2192 target\u2192 engage\u2192 assess\u201d kill-chain that the Philippines is establishing through its military modernisation efforts. Their capabilities are sufficiently advanced that similar systems also form critical components of Japan\u2019s national air defence system. More recently, readouts surrounding new prime minister Suga Yoshihide\u2019s visit to Indonesia highlighted advanced discussions towards the sale of new-build Japanese destroyers to the Indonesian Navy. Should this come to fruition, it will be a more obvious marker that Japan is engaged in all dimensions of Southeast Asia\u2019s maritime security. Regional Maritime Security: Japan\u2019s Support Japan\u2019s 1947 constitution famously declares that it will never maintain a war potential, yet policies almost immediately eroded the purity of that stance. In 1954, the JSDF was established. Still, Japan\u2019s posture was decidedly non-aggressive. For decades, Japan\u2019s de facto navy, the Japan Maritime Self Defence Force (JMSDF), limited its operations to the waters near Japan. Its activities in Southeast Asia were confined to navigation transits, goodwill visits, and logistics support for UN peacekeeping missions. This restrained stance did not prevent Japan from strongly supporting Southeast Asia\u2019s maritime safety and security. In the late 1960s, Japanese support began with the provision of large-scale funding of maritime infrastructure, navigation markers, traffic management technology, and dredging services. These projects were an important part of Japan\u2019s success in rebuilding its positive image and overcoming of negative war memories. In the wake of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis and the associated spike in Southeast Asian sea robberies, Japan enlarged its role to include capacity-building activities aimed at regional law enforcement agencies. The highly capable Japan Coast Guard (JCG) took a central role in these initiatives. It was only from around 2010 that the JSDF began to directly engage with Southeast Asian militaries through capacity-building activities and exercises, but limited its focus to non-warfighting missions such as anti-piracy, surveillance, military medicine, and disaster response. Abe's Southeast Asia Posture When Abe Shinzo returned as prime minister in 2012 (he previously served in the post in 2006-7), he surprised many by making his first overseas destinations Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia rather than the United States. Japan\u2019s support for Indo-Pacific maritime security would be a focus of his nearly eight years in office. The JCG and JMSDF assumed new roles and missions and Abe linked their activities into a cohesive strategy centrally driven from his office and the new National Security Council. Abe\u2019s Free and Open Indo-Pacific Vision placed Southeast Asia\u2019s maritime space at the nexus of Japan\u2019s foreign policy. Maritime capacity building was also the focus under the Vientiane Vision, a 2016 roadmap toward enhanced defence cooperation between Japan and Southeast Asian partners. Additionally, JSDF flatdeck helicopter carriers headlined annual deployments to Southeast Asia, maritime patrol aircraft frequented Philippine airfields, submarines docked in Subic Bay and Cam Ranh Bay, and a new amphibious unit stormed beaches alongside US and Philippine marines during exercise Balikatan. Abe\u2019s policy reforms also replaced long-standing prohibitions on weapons exports with a carefully crafted system allowing export of defence systems to partners meeting specific criteria. Five retired training aircraft delivered to the Philippines Navy became the first defence systems to be transferred from the Ministry of Defence to a foreign partner. Lacking military-grade sensors or weapons, these could not be considered full-fledged military equipment even though the Philippines pressed them into service for maritime patrol. Still, these represented an important capability for the Philippines to enhance its maritime domain awareness and a key precedent paving the way for the recent breakthrough. What to Expect from PM Suga In September, Abe handed over power to his policy \u2018right-hand man,\u2019 Suga Yoshihide. We can expect Suga to continue expanding cross-sector support for Southeast Asian maritime security. Indeed, Suga followed Abe\u2019s example by heading to Southeast Asia for his first overseas trip. Maritime security and defence cooperation featured at the centre of his regional diplomatic tour. We can also expect Japan\u2019s foreign security policy to follow the balanced low-profile approaches that keep their strategic significance generally under the radar. Suga is known for his even-keeled approach to policy implementation; we should not expect the diplomatic showmanship of Abe. Suga also understands that Japan\u2019s security contributions have been historically welcomed because they de-emphasised the military dimension in favour of assisting the region with other high-priority concerns. Thus, even as some regional states will increasingly welcome Japanese military contributions, Suga will emphasise economic assistance and capacity-building projects. When it comes to Southeast Asian maritime security, we can expect a greater presence from Japan, without it being seen as provocative. Its maritime forces will be increasingly available but postured to remain unassuming and sensitive to regional concerns."

    "title": "Global Health Security Military Response to COVID-19: Advantages and Constraints",
    "author(s)": "By Angelo Paolo Trias",
    "date": "No. 065 \u2013 7 April 2020",
    "content": "MILITARIES ARE increasingly deployed to respond to non-traditional security issues threatening the well-being of states and societies, despite the United Nations\u2019 guidance that they should only be used as a last resort. The growing utilisation of militaries in many parts of the world is often attributed to the widening gap between the needs of affected populations, resource demands, and capacity of civilian actors to fulfill both in rapid and large-scale emergencies and disasters. We are observing a similar case in today\u2019s global pandemic response. As health care, law enforcement, and social service systems are increasingly strained by the widespread effects of COVID-19, more and more militaries are being mobilised. While there are advantages in involving militaries in the fight against the coronavirus, there are also constraints and potential drawbacks for doing so. The Military Factor The organisational structure of militaries enable them to provide surge capacity, like mobilising additional resources to deal with extraordinary demands, at a speed and scale that no other parts of government can match. Military forces are made up of able-bodied personnel that are clearly organised in teams with a defined chain of command. This gives them the ability to efficiently form and reform units for a range of operations. Combined with access to major assets such as airlifts, sealifts, and heavy utility vehicles as well as the expertise to maintain and operate those, militaries have unique capabilities that governments can employ during national-level crises and calamities. Militaries can meaningfully contribute to a country\u2019s pandemic response. So far, we observe this in six key areas: (i) law enforcement support; (ii) health and medical assistance; (iii) logistics and engineering services; (iv) humanitarian assistance; (v) crisis management; and (vi) research. The Plus Side The presence of militaries commands authority and creates deterrence. This is particularly useful in maintaining peace and order in densely populated urban areas where police capacity is stretched out. Mobilising militaries can help reduce and prevent civil disobedience and opportunistic crime that may disrupt or lessen the effectiveness of pandemic responses. To \u2018flatten the curve\u2019, military forces like those from France, Italy, Malaysia, Panama, Philippines, Peru and Spain are supporting the police in controlling movement, enforcing curfews, restrictions, and closing non-essential establishments. imposing travel Military operations are designed to be self-sufficient. So military forces have the capacity to offer not only personnel and services, but also the assets and infrastructure needed without additional burden on civilians. This comes in handy when providing health and medical assistance, as well as logistics and engineering services. Soldiers from Spain are constructing makeshift hospitals, while those from France are transporting the sick. Most militaries, however, are assisting in conventional aid and relief-related activities such as packing goods, guarding shipments, and delivering supplies. There are also militaries undertaking unconventional roles including those that do not necessarily rely on brute force. Personnel from a South Korean military command formed to decontaminate areas following Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) attacks has been deployed on the streets sterilising infected facilities. The UK military drew on defence scientists to assist public health in suppressing the spread of the coronavirus. While Singapore is ingeniously employing its servicemen to enhance the nation\u2019s psychological defence, in Spain, the military has been deployed to deep-clean hospitals and manage dead bodies in care homes. The Downside Militaries are strikingly visible. Depending on the context, military response may be perceived as \u2018the government is taking action\u2019 \u2013 a way to project force and model good governance. Or it may be perceived as \u2018militarising the pandemic response\u2019 and cause unwanted fear and panic. Public sentiment should be considered and civilian leaders need to manage this carefully. Rules that are unclear and poorly communicated are highly prone to abuse by state forces. Germany presents a good example of how the right messaging can increase people\u2019s acceptance of extraordinary measures. Militaries, particularly those in direct contact with civilians, can do their part of allaying public concern by ridding themselves of weapons and tactical gears whenever reasonable. The primary function of militaries is to ensure national security which involves defending the state from internal and external attacks that threaten national sovereignty and territorial integrity. Militaries assisting in civilian affairs do so, first and foremost, to support this mission rather than the humanitarian imperative. Militaries on mission are wired to clearly distinguish \u2018friends\u2019 versus \u2018foes\u2019. If a military is party to an internal conflict such as separatist movements, struggles over community rights, local political and electoral violence, and urban crime, populations associated with or tagged as \u2018enemies\u2019 will lose access to aid and relief. Balancing Civil-Military Relationships To counterbalance this, civilian authorities need to assign a dedicated civil-military coordinator to proactively engage militaries in dialogue \u201cto protect and promote humanitarian principles, avoid competition, minimise inconsistency, and when appropriate, pursue common goals\u201d. Militaries are exceptionally adaptable. Although not everything they have and can do are applicable to the issue at hand. Militaries need to highlight their capability gaps to civilian counterparts early on. For instance, the US Department of Defence explicitly noted that their resources are designed for treating physical trauma \u2013 not for dealing with infectious diseases. As such their field hospitals do not necessarily have segregated spaces, and hospital ships can only treat patients suffering from noninfectious ailments and injuries. It is well-defined and as witnessed in New York City, the US military hospital ship anchored there is freeing civilian hospitals of non-infected cases so the latter can focus on patients with COVID-19. Military-led responses, however, face certain limitations in implementation. For example, military institutions are dominated by able-bodied males which means that special arrangements have to be made for them to take care of women, children, and other vulnerable segments of the population. In some cases, female military personnel have to be specifically deployed in helping the civilian authorities. Closing the Gap? Military response can fill in the civilian capacity gap or it can widen the gap. If employed prudently and judiciously, the military can contribute to a positive outcome. The military can help in many ways, but they cannot solve the government\u2019s response problems. Crises and calamities are also windows of opportunities because they reveal the strengths and dysfunctions of societies they hit. Several militaries, especially in Southeast Asia, are first responders and front-liners of governments in such times. They are experienced in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief work. Yet, COVID-19 is an extraordinary pandemic and the demand is different. It is not obvious how the militaries will come out of this particular crisis."

    "author(s)": "By Alexander R. Arifianto",
    "date": "No. 059 \u2013 2 April 2020",
    "content": "ON 31 MARCH 2020, Indonesian president Joko \u2019Jokowi\u2019 Widodo declared a national emergency to institute quarantine orders to limit the spread of COVID-19. The emergency will also see a temporary ban of all foreign visitors -- except diplomats and work permit holders -- from entering or transiting the country. The emergency authorises the Indonesian military (TNI) and the national police to close off roads in major Indonesian cities like Jakarta to prevent people from entering or leaving the cities, and as a last resort, public facilities as well. The emergency was imposed after the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Indonesia reached 1,528. No less than 136 patients have died from the disease, making Indonesia the country with the highest COVID-19 death toll in Southeast Asia. Unprepared for Pandemic The president\u2019s emergency declaration is welcome news for public health experts and medical professionals. They were increasingly frustrated over the alleged slow response of Indonesian government officials -- particularly those in the Health Ministry -- to prepare the country for the pandemic, to test more prospective cases, and institute strong social distancing measures, to prevent a further spread of the pandemic. Critics noted that preventive measures in Indonesia against COVID-19 were lackadaisical from the beginning of the pandemic, when it had not spread inside Indonesia. On 17 February, Terawan Agus Putranto, the country\u2019s minister of health, condemned a Harvard University study which estimated that Indonesia should have at least several cases of the virus by mid-February. He also stated Indonesia was immune from the virus thanks to the prayers of millions of Indonesians. The Jokowi administration was also criticised for its slow response in testing suspected COVID-19 carriers and in coordinating with regional governments to prepare for social distancing measures that might bring down the number of potential infections. Jokowi has resisted calls to institute a nationwide lockdown as a measure to curtail the pandemic spread, as he argues such measures would hurt some 55 percent of Indonesians who are working in the informal economy. More controversially, he initially vetoed the proposal by provincial governors to institute a lockdown of their regions, arguing that such an authority rests with the national government. The emergency decree seemed to be a compromise for the regional leaders. While they may proceed to institutionalise regional lockdown measures, they must adhere to the guidelines set up by the national government. Political Dimension of the COVD-19 Pandemic The slow response to the pandemic in Indonesia can also be attributed to its current political structure which revolves around power-sharing with party leaders and influence brokers so as to ensure that Jokowi\u2019s legislative agenda gets enacted by parliament. It also prioritises appointments based on political connections instead of professional capabilities. In his desire to seek political stability, Jokowi has given ministerial positions to former rivals like Prabowo Subianto -- leader of the Gerindra Party -- who is now minister of defence. He also has appointed former retired Indonesian military (TNI) generals and police generals to join his cabinet. Six out of 34 ministers of Jokowi\u2019s current cabinet are retired TNI or police generals, including Terawan -- the health minister. While the system works to stabilise the current administration, it means that often political considerations are given priority over technocratic expertise. Thus in a crisis like what Indonesia is experiencing, these ministries can be blindsided and lack inputs from professional experts -- thereby slowing their response once a crisis has become full-blown and more difficult to manage. To enact and implement policies promptly to respond to the health crisis and save more Indonesian lives, Jokowi needs to appoint advisers and experts from related medical backgrounds to be in charge of the national response to the pandemic. The government\u2019s newly announced special task force to counter the COVID-19 pandemic is a step in the right direction. However, the task force currently lacks members with expertise in epidemiology, virology, or public health. The government should consider appointing professionals like Dr Iqbal Ridzi Fahdri Elyazar from the Eijkman-Oxford Clinical Research Unit or Professor Soetjipto from the biochemistry faculty of Airlangga University as technical experts (staff ahli) who may advise the government on the steps it needs to take to control the virus\u2019 spread. Lack of Public Health Spending Finally, the Indonesian public health system is cash-strapped to handle the COVID-19 pandemic. The country\u2019s public spending on health in 2016 (most recent year available) is only 3.12 percent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP).  In contrast, Philippines and Vietnam -- two populous Southeast Asian countries other than Indonesia -- spend respectively 4.4 percent and 5.7 percent of their GDP for public health expenditures. The relatively low public spending on health care translates into the lack of \u2018critical care\u2019 facilities for the worst affected patients. Most of the 132 public hospitals designated to treat COVID-19 patients lack ventilators, medications, and other necessities required to help treat patients effectively. Due to the chronic underfunding of the Indonesian health system and the shortage of medical facilities and supplies necessary to mitigate the pandemic, the international community needs to step in to provide assistance to the Indonesian government through both financial and in-kind assistance. These especially should include ventilators, protective equipment for health workers, and medicine so that millions of Indonesians who are vulnerable to the pandemic impacts can be saved. Without this assistance, a new study by the National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas) and University of Indonesia estimates that up to 2.5 million Indonesians could be infected by COVID-19 by the end of April 2020, with up to 240,000 estimated fatalities. This will leave the Indonesian health system fully incapacitated to handle the growing toll."

    "title": "AI and Technology Convergence: Catalyst or Irritant of Change?",
    "author(s)": "By Zoe Stanley-Lockman",
    "date": "No. 057 \u2013 1 April 2020",
    "content": "GOVERNMENTS HAVE lost their status as engines of innovation in the 20th century, but that does not mean they do not have a role to play today. Through investments, policy incentives, and regulation, governments wield important tools to shape the way that technological innovation intersects with social structures. This exact intersection, especially in relation to the term \u201ctechnology convergence,\u201d is worth exploring, Scientists Mihael Roco and William Bainbridge describe technology convergence as a fusion between disciplines with shared methodologies, theories, and goals. What is Technology Convergence Technology convergence also means considering the impact on people and power structures \u2013 be it at the individual, organisational, community, societal, or global scale. To this end, the shared goals are important for governments so that a greater purpose, not just the technology, drives decisions. After providing an example of this type of convergence, the trend is examined in light of the governmental responsibilities that Roco and Bainbridge have described. These responsibilities are to set long-term research priorities and facilitate conditions to invent and deploy beneficial technologies. At the same time, they are to respect the ethical and social implications of potential uses of the technologies. The example of neuroscience converging with high-tech inventions makes the concept of technology convergence more concrete. Although decades old in ideation, hardware like neuromorphic chips and artificial intelligence (AI) systems called neural nets have recently become cutting-edge. These technologies allow computers to work quickly and learn relatively complex tasks. They derive their names from the fact that they mimic qualities of the human brain, like its structure and energy efficiency. In this example, neuroscience is not merely an inspiration, but has actually become part of the baseline for pushing forward the boundaries of high-tech inventions. Advances in neuroscience may have amplifying effects when they become integrated into the design of these cutting-edge technologies, including in AI or even brain- computer interfaces. To see the true impact of these technologies means understanding how humans interact with them, as can be learned about in social sciences and humanities. Introducing these social elements is important because technology often plays a role irritating or alleviating existing problems. Just as technology does not cause problems alone, it should not be seen as a solution itself. Responsible Innovation Technological innovation is becoming increasingly complex, particularly because it relies on the convergence between different fields. It also means that the pace of innovation may be increasingly difficult for decision-makers to anticipate. This is not because governments are no longer the primary innovation drivers, but rather because the ingredients are too numerous and fast-evolving to monitor. Governments\u2019 roles in managing technology instead relies on steering development in a way that benefits their societies \u2013 or even humanity more broadly. One moniker for this, championed by the public and private sectors alike, is responsible innovation. Responsible innovation can be carried out in accordance with the three governmental responsibilities of setting long-term research priorities, creating the favourable conditions for invention and deployment, and managing ethical and social aspects including potential abuses of technology. Instead of seeing these as separate questions, the ways they inform each other provide governments with a more robust role. Setting long-term research priorities is difficult because it involves protracted investment and the right environment to enable creativity to grow into innovation. Often this takes the form of nostalgia to replicate a \u201cSputnik\u201d or \u201cmoonshot\u201d style of innovation. Because this mission-driven, exorbitant investment may not be feasible or sustainable, it becomes more important to create the conditions for broader ecosystems to flourish beyond the grasp of government. This still includes public investment in basic research \u2013 without which many advances in computing, AI, energy storage technologies, and autonomous vehicles would not be seen today. It also includes raising the profile of technology mediators and experts in areas such as history, anthropology, the sociology of science, and ethics. The governmental role in baking the ethical and societal implications of potential technology into earlier stages of the innovation lifecycle is perhaps the most urgent one. Aligning with Human Values As inventions and societies become increasingly interconnected, more and more industries have to consider how their products and services become accelerants or irritants of societal change. To this end, the governmental role includes facilitating convergence. This means encouraging more interdisciplinary efforts and more explicit recognition of the socio- technical nexus that many innovations epitomise. Today, these conversations converge around AI ethics and governance. It is important to get these preliminary questions right because AI is a general-purpose technology, like electricity or the steam engine, that will affect all sectors. These questions become even more important when designing the governance of other emerging technologies \u2013 and AI as such can be seen as the groundwork for governance of future technology convergence, when questions of human augmentation become more mainstream. For governments, steering these developments can mean aligning technological development with human values to the benefit of society \u2013 as well as asserting their role in relation to evolving conceptions of power that increasingly involve technology."

    "title": "Global Health Security COVID-19 & Its Impacts Vaccine Politics: Compulsory Licensing in SE Asia?",
    "author(s)": "By Hannah Elyse Sworn",
    "date": "No. 067 \u2013 23 April 2021",
    "content": "ACCESS TO COVID-19 vaccines has become highly politicised, creating diplomatic spats such as that between the European Union and Britain and triggering a wave of export controls on medical products. Developed states have snapped up the lion\u2019s share of high-efficacy patented vaccines produced by Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna while their less-developed counterparts struggle to secure sufficient supplies for their populations. As developing countries lose out in the race to secure COVID-19 vaccinations, conflict over patent protection as a barrier to access to essential medicines has reared its ugly head. What policy options are available for governments in the region to secure sufficient supplies of expensive patented vaccines that have thus far been snapped up by developed states? Intellectual Property in the COVID-19 Era As of March 2021, 76% of all vaccine doses had been administered in ten \u2014 mostly high-income \u2014 countries where younger, less at-risk populations are being inoculated before vulnerable groups in developing countries. This vaccination gap increases the risk of extending the pandemic through additional waves, new strains and global economic fallout originating from countries with low vaccine coverage. Like many other drugs, COVID-19 vaccines are protected by patents, which \u2014 to incentivise innovation \u2014 stop an invention from being produced without permission from the patent holder for a certain period of time. However, the enforcement of property rights for essential drugs during global health crises has been a longstanding controversy, from the HIV/AIDS pandemic of the 1980s and 90s to the 2006 swine flu pandemic and now COVID-19. High IP protections of drugs can prevent the production of cheap but equally effective generic versions and impede access to medications in countries that cannot afford expensive branded drugs. Yet, pharmaceutical companies argue that patents are necessary to encourage invention of life-saving drugs in the first place. Moderna has announced that it will not enforce the patent on its vaccine in the short term. However, in the WTO, developed countries have blocked a request from over 80 developing states for an IP waiver on all COVID-19 vaccines, presumably to protect their economic interests. Similarly, the WHO\u2019s COVID-19 technology access pool \u2014 which provides countries with access to patent-free drug technology and data \u2014 has thus far had zero contributions from pharmaceutical companies. The Politics of Southeast Asia\u2019s Vaccine Dilemma In the midst of vaccine protectionism, China has emerged as a champion of global public goods in health, donating vaccines to 53 developing countries around the world, including millions to ASEAN members. Beijing is also partnering with Indonesian drug firm PT Bio Farma, who will manufacture enough Sinovac for 40% of Indonesia\u2019s vaccine needs and eventually serve as a regional vaccine production hub. Yet, there are fears that over-reliance on Chinese vaccines will increase Beijing\u2019s leverage to secure favourable compromises on its regional security interests, such as those in the South China Sea. This concern is amplified by the declining trust between the region\u2019s governments and China, illustrated by the recent increase in Chinese fishing boats in waters claimed by the Philippines and a new law that authorises the Chinese Coast Guard to fire on foreign vessels in disputed waters. Alternative vaccines from the US and its partners may not come fast enough, putting Southeast Asian governments in a difficult position. In March the Quad \u2014 a security dialogue platform comprising the United States, Australia, Japan and India \u2014 pledged to supply one billion vaccines to Southeast Asia by the end of 2022. However, these states have a much more immediate need to vaccinate their populations to prevent further fatalities and bolster economic recovery. Responses to Compulsory Licensing The 1994 WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) drew intense criticism for impeding access to medicines by increasing the minimum IP standards for all WTO members. The ensuing 2001 Doha Declaration and 2003 WTO Ministerial decision gave developing countries the right to use TRIPS \u2018flexibilities\u2019 to bypass IP protections for public health and national emergencies. One of these flexibilities is compulsory licensing, which allows a country to produce, export and import a patented drug without permission from the patent holder. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, compulsory licensing has drawn attention as a useful tool for speeding up access to vaccines through more efficient regional production. Although pharmaceutical companies and developed states view compulsory licensing as expropriation,  Canada, Chile, Ecuador, France, Germany and Israel have all taken steps to make compulsory licensing easier since the start of the pandemic, although Israel is the only country to have issued a compulsory licence (for an early and ultimately ineffective virus treatment). Although compulsory licensing carries the risk of backlash from pharmaceutical companies and its administrative requirements are burdensome, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia have a long history with compulsory licensing. These countries have previously used compulsory licences to produce and import drugs to treat HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, cancer and cardiovascular disease. Compulsory Licensing in Southeast Asia? In 2003, Malaysia became the first Asian country to issue compulsory licenses post- TRIPS, paving the way for Thailand and Indonesia to do the same on numerous occasions between 2004 and 2012. Their experience is valuable given ASEAN\u2019s commitment to information sharing on using TRIPS flexibilities to facilitate access to essential medications. These three countries in addition to the Philippines and Vietnam also have well-established domestic drugs industries with the capacity to manufacture pharmaceuticals for domestic consumption and export. Compulsory licensing could be a useful way for Southeast Asian states to secure vaccine access without the political consequences of reliance on China or the economic and health consequences of waiting for slow vaccine donations from the US and its partners. Governments can continue using Chinese vaccines in the short term while working towards producing a variety of vaccines under compulsory licenses to reduce their dependence on external parties. Whether they choose to employ this flexibility will ultimately depend on how each perceives the severity of the virus and the risks of relying on the US or China."

    "title": "The Medan Suicide Attack: Enablers of Radicalism",
    "author(s)": "By Unaesah Rahmah",
    "date": "No. 015 \u2013 22 January 2020",
    "content": "THE MEDAN suicide attack in North Sumatra on 13 November 2019 was perpetrated by Rabial Muslim Nasution (RMN) alias Dedek; it killed him and wounded six others, including four police officers and two civilians. Investigations later revealed RMN had regularly attended an exclusive religious study session connected to Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), a local pro-IS group. His wife had also played a key role in radicalising RMN into terrorism. The case illustrates the role of religious study sessions and kinship networks as enablers of participation in terrorist activity in Indonesia. Religious Study Sessions Pengajian \u2013 both public and closed-door \u2013 is a common method in Indonesia to disseminate Islamic teachings. It has been a popular form of gathering for Muslims in their search for religious knowledge. Militant groups, exploiting this platform, organise their own versions of public pengajian. This exposes the community to the former's ideology and, in doing so, identifies potential recruits. Pengajian itself is not a source of terrorism, although some extremist groups resort to the pengajian approach for recruitment. The next step \u2013 or done concurrently \u2013 is organising exclusive study sessions with a few attendees who have shown commitment to the group's ideology. The close-knit study session usually has a physical training (i\u2019dad) component as preparation for hijrah (migration) or amaliyah (operation). An example is the exclusive pengajian run by Dita Oeprianto, the mastermind of the Surabaya church bombings in May 2018. He had organised study sessions in his house, attended by three families, including his own, to foster the attendees\u2019 commitment to IS ideology that manifested eventually in the attacks.  The sessions also acted as a vehicle for Dita to recruit, plan, and coordinate members to make bombs, raise funds, and conduct surveillance for the Surabaya attacks. Similarly, in the case of the Medan bombing, RMN had attended a regular closed-door pengajian in Belawan, Medan, since April 2018. Allegedly led by pro-IS preachers, pengajian members comprised at least seven other persons \u2013 two couples (including RMN and his wife) and three brothers. The two cases show that the offline study session remains a typical way to transmit extremist ideology despite the prevalence of online radicalisation among Indonesian radical supporters. Online radicalisation works as an echo-chamber for supporters to find other like-minded individuals. It could contribute to a person\u2019s radicalisation pathway but it will not necessarily lead him to take violent action.  Offline religious study sessions remain an essential component for a person to reach the apex of the radicalisation stairway \u2013 committing violence. Kinship: Recruitment and Fostering Commitment According to Muhammed Hafez, a US-based terrorism expert, recruitment through kinship relations is possible and more natural because the ideological transmission takes place in a non-threatening environment, and the ideas are infused with emotional commitment. There appears some difference in the pattern of kinship-based indoctrination or recruitment in the IS as opposed to that of Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) in the past. The latter was said to be dominated by men or male superiors within the JI circle. IS cases of recent years highlight the role of women as influencers within the family. In RMN\u2019s case, it was reportedly his wife who introduced him to radical ideology. Nothing much is known at this stage about the wife, but she was reportedly in close contact with radical female inmates in the Medan prison. She was not the first woman known to have influenced the husband into terror acts. Previously, Anggi Indah Kusuma, who was deported from Hong Kong in April 2017, was believed to have introduced the concept of violent jihad to her husband. The traditional notion of children being influenced by their parents into radicalism has been matched by cases in which children have been the significant radical influence in the family. The case of Dwi Djoko Wiwoho\u2019s family is an example. In 2015, Dwi\u2019s younger daughter, Nurshadrina Khaira Dhania, was the one who played a critical role in convincing him, his wife and her older sister to hijrah to Syria and live under the rule of IS. Kinship relations is also a way to foster the individual\u2019s commitment and courage to abide with the terrorist group. One example is Ummu Shabrina, a woman who left with her family to Syria in 2014. Highly supportive of her husband\u2019s role as an IS fighter in Syria, she was very proud when her husband was killed in battle and shared the story of her husband\u2019s \u201cmartyrdom\u201d. The supportive gesture from a family member can entrap an individual to staunchly believe in the \u201crightness\u201d of violent jihad, beyond his/her ideological beliefs. New Regulation on Religious Study Sessions: Limits The Indonesian government does recognise the problems associated with religious study sessions.  The new regulation issued by the Ministry of Religious Affairs on Majelis Taklim (Islamic Religious Study Session) in November 2019 aims to detect and identify pengajian that are organised by extremist and terrorist networks. The regulation requires pengajian administrators to register the preachers, members, source of funding, and session venue. They also need to report their activities to the local religious affairs office annually and renew the pengajian certificate every five years. However, the government may face difficulties enforcing this rule effectively as registering religious study sessions does not appear mandatory. The Deputy Minister of Religious Affairs, in response to public backlash against the regulation, indicated that it was \u201charus\u201d (encouraged), rather than \u201cwajib\u201d (mandatory). His response suggests that those who fail to register may not face sanctions. Tightening the regulation further is unlikely given the pushback from society \u2013 i.e. perceptions of government interference in the private domain \u2013 on this new regulation. This gap in monitoring and control over pengajian, therefore, remains an opportunity for radical teachings to continue flourishing."

    "title": "Pakistan Stock Exchange Attack: New Wave of Ethno-separatist Violence?",
    "author(s)": "By Abdul Basit",
    "date": "No. 145 \u2013 17 July 2020",
    "content": "ON 29 JUNE 2020, four militants of a Baloch insurgent group, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), stormed the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSE), the financial nerve centre of the country. However, the attackers were neutralised by the security guards stationed outside the PSE building's main gate. The attack left seven people, including four militants and three security personnel, dead and as many injured. Before this, a series of attacks on the security forces in Balochistan and Sindh provinces as well as the re-emergence of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement London (MQM-L)'s militant wing in Karachi point to the revival of ethno-separatist groups in Pakistan. Though Pakistan's top political and military leadership have hinted at alleged Indian involvement in the PSE attack, there is a troubled history of mistrust and ethnic grievances in Balochistan and Sindh fueling recruitment and driving ethnic violence. The Baloch and Sindhi separatist groups have forged a new tactical alliance against Chinese economic interests in Pakistan. Ethno-Separatist Groups in Pakistan This new wave of violence in Pakistan should be seen in the broader context of shifting geopolitical sands in South Asia, which have thrown up new opportunities to several militant groups. The expected US withdrawal from Afghanistan, the intra-Afghan peace process and the growing Chinese economic footprint under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) are leading to geopolitical realignments in the region. Given its pivotal position at the crossroads of South and Central Asian regions, Pakistan finds itself in the crosshairs of these geopolitical developments. Of the 73 militant groups banned by the National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA), Pakistan's central counter-terrorism agency, 13 are ethno-separatists. The lack of an inclusive development model and ham-fisted policies of the state lie at the heart of political alienation and socio-economic grievances in Sindh and Balochistan. The onset of the US$62 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the flagship project of the Chinese BRI, in Balochistan has further disenfranchised the Baloch groups. CPEC, which originates from China's Xinjiang province and culminates at Balochistan's Gwadar port, is a series of infrastructure projects involving highways, rail tracks, ports and electric grid stations, among others. Baloch Separatist Groups Balochistan is rich in minerals and due to its lucrative location, has the potential to be developed into a vibrant economic hub in the future. For instance, Balochistan's Reko Diq copper and gold mine has an estimated $5.9 billion in copper reserves and $4.5 million in gold reserves. The Baloch fear that they will be turned into a minority in their province and robbed of their rich mineral resources. The Baloch separatist groups view China as a coloniser and aggressor. Claiming responsibility for the PSE attack, BLA's spokesperson maintained \"it was intended to target the Pakistani economy and Chinese economic interests, in response to China's exploitative plans in Balochistan,\" an apparent reference to China's 40 per cent ownership of the PSE. In 2016, a Chinese conglomerate, consisting of China Financial Futures Exchange Company Limited, Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange, combined with Pak-China Investment Company Limited and Habib Bank Limited to purchase 40 per cent PSE shares. BLA also carried out the 2018 Chinese consulate attack in Karachi and the 2019 Pearl Continental Gwadar attack. BLA's Majid Brigade has been specially created to target Chinese interests and projects in Pakistan. In September last year, four Baloch militant groups \u0336 BLA, the Balochistan Liberation Front, the Baloch Republican Guard and the Baloch Republican Army \u0336  formed a new alliance, the Baloch Raji Ajoi Sangar (BRAS). The BRAS has been established to pool together human and financial resources to extend these groups\u2019 geographical outreach, improve operational coordination and diversify attack targets in Pakistan. Sindhi Separatist Groups Two types of separatist groups operate in Sindh, the MQM-L affiliated militant wing, the Mohajir Resistance Force, operating in Karachi and the Sindhi separatist groups such as the Sindhudesh Revolutionary Army (SRA) and Sindhudesh Liberation Army (SLA) \u0336 active in the interior parts of the province. On 19 June, SRA targeted Sindh Rangers in three separate attacks in Ghotki, Karachi and Larkana. The reactivation of MQM-L's militant wing in Karachi also fits into the broader pattern of the revival of ethno-separatist groups in Pakistan. On June 26, the Sindh Rangers and Karachi police arrested three terrorists belonging to the MQM-L's militant wing who were planning low-intensity attacks in different parts of the port city. The post-arrest investigations also revealed that MQM-L is re-organising several small cells to carry out terrorist attacks in Karachi. Revision of Internal Security Framework In light of the evolving security environment, Pakistan's internal security framework enshrined in the National Action Plan (NAP), a 20-point counter-terrorism and extremism roadmap, formed in January 2015 needs to be revised. Critical points of the NAP included eliminating terrorist infrastructure, madrassa reforms and the ban on hate speech, among others. NAP's lopsided focus on hard measures and less than ideal implementation on soft measures make Pakistan's counter-terrorism gains fragile and reversible. The structural factors of violence such as religious intolerance, poor socio-economic conditions and ethno-nationalist grievances remain unaddressed in Pakistan. As long as structural factors are not addressed, violence, whether religiously inspired or ethnically motivated, would likely continue to re-erupt in Pakistan."

    "title": "Sino-Indian Himalayan Misadventures: What Now for Regional Geopolitics?",
    "author(s)": "By Nazia Hussain",
    "date": "No. 172 \u2013 18 September 2020",
    "content": "TENSIONS ALONG the disputed Sino-Indian border have flared yet again, following a brief hiatus after one of the deadliest border clashes earlier this year in the Galwan Valley \u2014 an area between Indian-controlled Ladakh and Chinese-controlled Aksai Chin. At least 20 Indian soldiers were killed while Beijing has declined to confirm casualties on its side. Despite five rounds of Corps Commander-level talks since the Galwan Valley clashes in June to discuss disengagement between the two armies along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), both Beijing and New Delhi have instead sent reinforcements to the area. With a high-altitude volatile and increasingly militarised border, it therefore came as no surprise when recent reports emerged of a fresh row between the nuclear-armed neighbours accusing each other of trying to seize territory across the disputed Himalayan border. Fresh Spate of High-altitude Tension The latest stand-off took place in the south bank of the Pangong Tso \u2014 a glacier lake that stretches from Tibet to Ladakh. An Indian army statement alleged that China had carried out \u201cprovocative military movements\u201d in the border area and Indian troops pre- empted PLA activity on the Pangong Tso Lake. Rejecting the accusations, China's PLA regional command alleged that India was \u201cseriously violating China's territorial sovereignty\u201d. Relations further deteriorated as the two countries contended that shots had been fired by the other side along the disputed border for the first time in 45 years, violating a 1996 no-fire agreement. Although talks between defence ministers of the two countries proved inconclusive, their foreign ministers meeting struck a different note. The joint statement called for de-escalation and disengagement of troops along the disputed LAC and urged for new Confidence Building Measures. There was however no mention of restoration of status quo ante and no signs of disengagement has been reported as yet. Impact on Bilateral Economic Relations Bilateral relations sink to a low as Chinese state media accused the Modi government of stoking nationalist fervour and trying to decouple economically from China. India banned 118 Chinese apps citing national security risks. Furthermore, New Delhi has also announced stringent rules on Chinese investments \u2014 around 50 investment proposals involving Chinese companies are being reviewed under a new screening policy. The state of Bihar has cancelled a contract for a $390 million bridge over the Ganges River due to the involvement of Chinese companies while Maharashtra has frozen three Chinese investments, including the planned purchase of a General Motors plant there by privately run Great Wall Motor. Coupled with tougher scrutiny of shipments from China, reports suggest the apparent goal is to freeze Chinese companies out of India's public sector entirely. Economic considerations aside, a sore point for China was the Indian Army\u2019s deployment of a predominantly ethnic Tibetan Special Frontier Force, which prompted Chinese state media to accuse India of playing the Tibet card. Wider Geopolitical Implications As Sino-Indian tensions escalate, smaller South Asian countries have displayed a muted response. Their reluctance to choose sides is not unexpected as India has been the traditional power in South Asia while China has increasingly made its presence felt in the region through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Beijing has poured an estimated US$100 billion into infrastructure projects in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, the Maldives, Pakistan, Nepal and Sri Lanka. What concerns New Delhi is the fact that the heightened border tensions and China\u2019s rapid inroads into South Asia comes at a time when the Modi government\u2019s Neighbourhood First policy is not going as hoped despite starting out on a good note back in 2014. A series of policy choices has strained India\u2019s relations with its neighbours. Nepal has condemned India\u2019s unilateral act of building a Himalayan link road in a disputed territory which falls at a strategic three-way junction with Tibet and China. Relations with Bangladesh turned frosty over the Modi government\u2019s decision to set in motion the National Register of Citizens \u2014 an exercise aimed at weeding out illegal immigration from Bangladesh. New Delhi\u2019s already strained relations with Islamabad deteriorated with the decision to revoke the special status of the disputed state of Jammu and Kashmir. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka and Maldives are involved in China\u2019s BRI. India\u2019s best bet to reclaim the neighbourhood narrative would be to engage with its neighbours in a way that does not reek of \u2018big brother\u2019 arrogance if New Delhi is to hope for some show of support from its neighbours in a confrontation with China. The COVID-19 pandemic provides India an opportunity to salvage its Neighbourhood First policy. Prime Minister Modi reactivated the defunct South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and announced a COVID-19 Emergency Fund. While New Delhi\u2019s active role in composing a regional response to the pandemic had been lauded by regional leaders, this is likely issue-based cooperation and does not necessarily mean South Asian states are coalescing around India\u2019s sphere of influence. Expanding the Quad? Bolstering sub-regional cooperation would provide New Delhi an opportunity to effectively engage with its neighbours and deliver on the promises of regional infrastructure projects. India should work towards ensuring that sub-regional groupings like the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) and the Bangladesh-Bhutan-India-Nepal (BBIN) initiative can maintain their recently gained momentum. For instance, the BBIN Motor Vehicles Agreement for extensive multi- in addressing COVID-induced economic modal connectivity will be crucial vulnerabilities in the BBIN sub-region. Moreover, as far as neighbourhood relations go, New Delhi should stop pursuing a reactionary foreign policy based on China\u2019s regional manoeuvres and be more pro- active in engaging its neighbours. India rushed its foreign secretary to Dhaka following an announcement that Bangladesh will soon be receiving nearly US$1 billion from China for a management and restoration project on the Teesta river. Sharing of the Teesta waters has been a contentious issue between Bangladesh and India. The border clashes will likely strengthen New Delhi\u2019s resolve to overhaul its commitment to the Quad which is seen as a balancing tool vis-\u00e0-vis Chinese assertiveness. Signalling a change in Indian strategic calculus, New Delhi is reportedly planning to invite Australia to join the other Quad members \u2013 Japan and the United States \u2013 for its annual Malabar exercises after initially refusing to do so despite Canberra\u2019s willingness. The Sino-India border dispute may be raging on in the remote Himalayan frontiers, but its spillover into the wider geopolitics of the Indo-Pacific region is only just emerging."

    "author(s)": "By Jean-Marc Rickli",
    "date": "No. 208 \u2013 7 December 2020",
    "content": "LAST AUGUST, Elon Musk delivered a presentation about his latest company Neuralink and showcased a small implant that could read and transmit the neural activity of a pig. While his presentation attracted a lukewarm reception on behalf of neuroscientists, because the technology presented was already known, Neuralink\u2019s demonstration showcased the growing interest in neurotechnologies from both the private and military sectors. Neurotechnology can be defined as devices and procedures that are used to access, monitor, investigate, assess, manipulate, and emulate the structure and function of neural systems. Neurotechnology devices interface with biological nervous systems in order to monitor, assist or enhance the cognitive processes executed by those systems. Unlike artificial intelligence systems that seek to emulate or simulate functional aspects of the human brain, neurotechnologies are designed to record, monitor, functionally understand, and modulate processes in the brain. Military Applications of Neurotechnologies Three categories of military applications of neurotechnology can be identified. The first category relates to the enhancement of the warfighters\u2019 capabilities through various forms of transcranial electric stimulation technology. For instance, there is a wide range of possible military applications dealing with soldiers\u2019 mood disorder and with increasing resilience to stress and other emotions that impact their behaviour on the battlefield. The US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is also conducting research to treat soldiers and veterans with depression and post-traumatic stress disorders. Also being researched is mapping brain activity related to concentration and empathy so as to develop algorithms to stimulate these specific conditions. DARPA has also been conducting research on targeted neuroplasticity training to speed up learning processes for service members and other defence officials. The second category comprises neurotechnological systems for deception detection and interrogation capable of accessing concealed information in response to a stimulus. Medical diagnostics techniques such as functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) can here also be used as surveillance and interrogation tools. In these cases, brain-based lie detection technologies associate the truth-values of an uttered sentence or a mental state with specific patterns of brain activity. The third category, which also offers the widest range of military applications encompasses systems that establish a direct connection between the brain and an external device through brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). A BCI is a system that measures the activity of the central nervous system (CNS) and converts it into an artificial output that replaces, restores, enhances, supplements, or improves natural CNS output, and thereby changes the ongoing interactions between the CNS and its external or internal environment. In other words, a BCI enables interaction between the human brain and a machine, enabling the user to interact with a computer/machine with only the power of thought. BCIs can be used in various ways. Prosthetic systems, for example, can be used for cognitive and memory enhancement. Synthetic Telepathy & \u2018Brain Hacking\u2019 In November 2017, the University of Southern California conducted an experiment, in which for the first time a brain implant effectively improved human memory by increasing the working memory by 25% and the short-term memory by 15%. DARPA has also been testing memory-enhancing implants as part of the BRAIN Initiative, reaching significant improvements of short-term memory as far as 35%. Other DARPA memory enhancement-related projects include Restoring Active Memory an implant that would facilitate the formation of new memories and the retrieval of existing ones. BCIs can also extract information from the brain and communicate directly through interfaces, also known as synthetic telepathy. Experiments have shown that intended and covert speech could both be detected and subsequently translated by BCI software. Cross-species experiments have shown the possibility of synthetic telepathy, or mind-control, from the human brain to an animal tail. While brain to brain communication is still in its earliest stages, further developments could lead to the reality of mind control for various purposes and its intentional military use to control and extract information from the brains of soldiers or adversaries. Another frightening development could see the emergence of \u201cmalicious brain- hacking\u201d. This refers to the possibility of co-opting brain-computer interfaces and other neural engineering devices to access or manipulate neural information from the brain of users. Future Warfare: Human-Machine Teaming In the immediate future, one of the most likely competitive advantage of BCIs in warfare will be in the area of human-machine teaming. In 2015, DARPA enabled a quadriplegic woman to control an F-35 fighter jet in a simulator, using only brain receptors. In 2018, the experiment was extended to combine advancements in AI, swarm technology and BCI. In a simulation, DARPA\u2019s research indeed enabled the control of three aircraft simultaneously through a brain chip. In a significant development, DARPA improved the interaction between pilots and drones by not only allowing the pilot to send but also receive signals from the controlled crafts. These developments support the research of swarm of drones and the emerging operational concept of \u201cloyal wingman\u201d which connects piloted aircraft with AI-driven drones in air combat operations. For example, the US Air Force Skyborg programme, which seeks to develop an AI- based brain for its \u201cloyal wingman\u201d drones, is particularly interested in this technology. This research is, however, not limited to the United States, as Australia, China and Russia are also investing in human-machine teaming and \u201cloyal wingman\u201d concepts. Going forward, these potentially game-changing technologies alter the character of future warfare. Accordingly, the international community should lose no time in coming up with a governance system of brain data \u2500 to prevent the malicious uses of neurotechnologies and regulate their military applications."

    "author(s)": "By Angelo Paolo L. Trias",
    "date": "No. 004 \u2013 6 January 2020",
    "content": "ALBERT EINSTEIN once said: \u201cWe can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.\u201d Conventional disaster risk management (DRM) approaches often fall into this trap. While we are getting to know more about natural disasters, the ways in which we identify and analyse risks seem to be lagging behind. This limits our capacity to manage them more effectively. There is greater awareness that disasters are becoming more systemic, reinforcing vicious cycles of inequity and poverty. There is also broader recognition that its impacts largely depend on the choices we make about how we live and relate to our environment \u2013 both natural and man-made. Yet we still overfocus our DRM efforts on external threats rather than dangers lurking within. And we continue to prepare our responses to future catastrophic scenarios based on past events. Seeing the Links: Disasters and Networks Such approaches allow us to make analytical distinctions and to learn from experience. However, their usefulness is getting limited in an interconnected world. Network science and foresight methods can enable us to make sense of complexity in a world where everything seems to be increasingly linked including drivers of disaster risks. Experience and research taught us that disasters do not simply occur because people are in harm\u2019s way. They also result from people\u2019s vulnerability and lack of capacity to withstand and pull through after a disruptive and damaging event. Knowing about this human dimension of disasters made us more aware of the role of our behaviour in shaping risks. However, years of focusing on natural hazards have conditioned us to look at risks coming from the outside instead of those emerging from the inside \u2013 those driven by our decisions and actions. A practical way to grasp today\u2019s disaster risks is to visualise it as a web of networks. Network science is an emerging discipline and academic field concerned with the study of complex networks behind interacting systems that modern societies rely on \u2013 whether environmental, social, political, economic, and technological. Using networks can enhance DRM efforts because it provides the lens to describe, analyse, and interpret the world in terms of relationships. Locating the Disaster Risks It can help us locate where disaster risks intersect and the different means to address them. For instance, examining interconnections of risks shed light on the how global trends interact to create or worsen natural disasters. Such network studies allow us to explore how socio-economic inequalities, the destruction of ecosystems, and misuse of emerging technologies can make people become more susceptible to disasters. A wider understanding of their links could be useful in crafting holistic risk-informed policies that cuts across sectors. It can also assist us in figuring out how mutually dependent systems we are embedded in are structured and the ways they relate with each other. For instance, studying the governance of DRM projects via networks reveal how imbalanced structures of power relations between donor governments, implementing organisations, and recipient countries can limit localisation efforts. DRM can be seen as an ecosystem that is jointly governed by various actors interacting with each other to direct, coordinate, and implement DRM activities. A deeper knowledge of the nature of relationships \u2013 where interests may converge and diverge \u2013 could be useful in identifying more efficient means for achieving shared objectives and use of available resources. The use of networks to study DRM is not new. But it is yet to gain more traction in practice. Stretching the Imagination Conventional DRM approaches are preferred even if they are struggling to cope with the increasing intensity and uncertainty of disasters in a new climate reality for two reasons. First, the best time to get action on disaster risk is usually right after a disaster. This is when citizen engagement, pressure on government, and media attention are quite high. It offers a \u2018window of opportunity\u2019 to implement changes in both policy and practice. Second, disaster risks are often analysed in a linear manner. A hazard is identified and assessed. Then, the likelihood of it turning into a disaster and potential impacts are analysed. Finally, steps are taken to mitigate, prepare for, respond to, and recover when it strikes. Both are problematic because they anticipate disasters based on past and known risks \u2013 which time and again turn out differently than expected. We have to stretch our imagination and actively seek what lies ahead and start making changes today, not after a tragedy. One way to do this is to utilise consequence-driven analysis as promoted by the Disaster Analytics for Society Lab which involves imagining disastrous outcomes, tracing back the series of events leading to it, and asking: why didn\u2019t this happen before? Simply put, it is a way to proactively think about how things could go wrong before it happens to catch DRM issues before they become bigger problems instead of learning after the fact \u2013 a pre-mortem. Futures Thinking Another is futures thinking advocated by the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) through the IFRC\u2019s Solferino Academy. It involves scanning the horizon, spotting trends, and developing scenarios to challenge notions of what is an appropriate DRM response in the future. The Forecast-based Financing project is a good example of how to apply this thinking into action. This approach is useful for revisiting how we develop DRM strategies because it raises the critical question: should we create plans by assessing what risks we face now and taking steps to a desired state, or should we start with a clear DRM goal and reflect back on steps needed to manage future risks? A report of the UN's Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) points out that, \u201cunderstanding risk is at the heart of building resilience to disasters\u201d. We are arguably getting better at this task. Although not complete and perfect, we are slowly amassing knowledge and tools to make sense of our interconnected world. The biggest challenge of DRM is grasping complexity and anticipating what lies ahead. We need to invest and do more, here and now, for uncertain disastrous events that could happen in the future."

    "title": "Afghanistan: Why the West Lost",
    "author(s)": "By Greg Mills",
    "date": "No. 105 \u2013 8 July 2021",
    "content": "As NATO troops prepare to leave Afghanistan by 11 September 2021 in the face of a Taliban surge, a question remains unanswered: Why did the international intervenors fail in their mission to bring stability to Afghanistan? The Western withdrawal from Afghanistan has gone hand in hand with a narrative of defeat, repeated so often it\u2019s in danger of becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Five reasons stand out to explain why the West has failed in its mission: West's Best Not Good Enough The West\u2019s best wasn\u2019t good enough: The lives of 3500 international troops plus an estimated 200,000 Afghans has not been sufficient to turn the tide against a highly motivated Taliban. This should not obscure the failure to accept from the outset that this was a strategic undertaking involving more than the toppling of the Taliban as the host of Al-Qaeda, leading to the failure to resource the mission accordingly. The usual excuse given is that the United States got distracted by Iraq. To an extent this is true, but this does not explain why Afghanistan did not stabilise even when greater resources were available. The West\u2019s political leadership have simply lacked the strategy and patience necessary to execute a longer war. There was no plan: The West\u2019s plan evolved by iteration, subject to changes in personalities \u2013 of ambassadors, commanders and politicians. Strikingly strategy was eclipsed by the operational art of the military as it morphed from regime change to nation-building, constantly reverse-engineered from facts on the ground. By doing so, the West became just another localised warlord, albeit a large and powerful \u2013 if temporary \u2013 one, to be managed, fought with, allied to, and even co- operated with, both for resources and in the realisation that it would eventually leave. Whatever the military failures, those of politicians, diplomats and aid agencies were spectacular by their relative invisibility. The last 20 years has been about the failure of politics, internationally and regionally, and internally by the Afghans. In particular, there has been little energy put into making regional peace until very late in the day, or peace for that matter with the Taliban in Afghanistan itself. Misguided solutions: Not only did the West overestimate the value of its agency, but the bureaucratic powerhouse of NATO exacerbated this dynamic, supercharging the detachment, jargon and militarisation in its self-interest. The chosen metrics suited the mission until that mission no longer suited the politics of NATO and of its only real enabler, the US. Geography trumped goodwill: Not only did the Taliban prove to be a formidable and resourceful foe, but it has also received assistance from outside. Most of the neighbourhood has had reason to resent and ultimately reject the Western presence. Pakistan\u2019s perception of the West\u2019s role was, from the outset, shaped by what Islamabad saw as its betrayal after the Soviet retreat in 1989, leaving it with a civil war on its borders and more than three million Afghan refugees within them. Thereafter the US retreated, only to return as an ally after 9/11. Afghanistan increasingly became a casualty of greater strategic interests, including the complex relationship between the West with Pakistan, complicated by the Pakistani-Indian relationship, and, overall, Islamic sentiments towards a Western presence. Iran and the \u2018stans \u2013 Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan \u2013 initially wanted an end to instability and to maintain their own spheres of interest in Afghanistan; this changed as the West became mired in the struggle and the direction of US-Iran and US-Russia relations continued to sour. The strategic sophistication of the current Taliban offensive, which appears designed to pressure Kabul by closing off access to its northern trading \u2018ports\u2019 into the Stans and forcing dependence on its southern routes via Pakistan, perfectly illustrates the pattern and extent of regional influences. Failure of development assistance: With a few exceptions, the metrics of aid became about the volumes of expenditure rather than effect, fuelling vast corruption. Since the vast majority of jobs in developing countries are in the private sector, there is a need to work out exactly what this sector needs to succeed. Between 2001 and 2019, two million men and women served from abroad in Afghanistan, and more than $2 trillion was expended, an extraordinary, once-in-a- generation commitment of resources to a poor country. It also represents a staggering opportunity cost. This does not mean that all is lost. The struggle of the last 20 years has not failed. It is instead incomplete. Rather than reverting to tired stereotypes about the war returning to an old Northern Alliance versus Taliban struggle, or the hopeful idea that the Islamists have somehow reformed in the last 20 years to a more moderate variant, this should be called for what it is: A war between a modernising republic and an obscurantist Taliban. Much has changed in the last 20 years, not least the embedding of modernity and government within communities. The failure of this modernising project, as President Ashraf Ghani notes, \u201cwould condemn the next six generations of Afghans to their fate\u201d. Afghanistan Should Find Its Own Way The West should not kid itself. If the Taliban took over, their method of governance in Afghanistan is unlikely to differ from that of 20 years ago, nor their international links more benign. It is moreover not 1996, when the Taliban was welcomed by many as a stabilising force freeing the country from the violent and costly anarchy of the feuding mujahideen warlords. Afghanistan will now have to find its own way, some of which may be uncomfortable to Western norms and sensitivities, from arming militia to cutting deals with tribal elders. Lots of powerful people have invested a lot of money in Afghanistan. Even if they might have externalised some, a collapse would cost them a great deal. And it will require implementing a different regional vision \u2013 more win-win than the current zero-sum \u2013 in which there are potentially rich rewards. The Western withdrawal from Afghanistan has gone hand in hand with a narrative of defeat, one damaging to Western moral authority and the value of its alliance. Need for New Directions With the current insurgency, a there is a need for new directions. Yet the West should back those wanting to modernise in the sober realisation that it lacked the imagination, diplomacy and staying power to do the job. Its best was simply not good enough. Instead three Western actions could stiffen an Afghan-led strategy, and achieve the things NATO was unable to get done. First, to provide the cash to pay soldiers (and pay off others). There is other assistance, including intelligence sharing and weapons maintenance, that would also be useful. The Afghan National Army is the \u201c\u2018backbone\u201d of the Afghan state, as Ahmad Massoud, son of the late Northern Alliance leader, has put it, and \u201c\u2018its biggest achievement\u201d. Second, to back a diplomatic solution that helps the modernisers come out on top, including helping \u2013 and stopping to assist \u2013 regional spoilers while encouraging Afghan unity against the Taliban. And third, while weaning Afghanistan off the aid fountain, and recognising its corrupting effect, to not cut it off completely in key areas, particularly regional infrastructure connectivity. Before peace is possible, war is going to be necessary, since without it, the Taliban has no incentive to stop fighting. Having the West in Afghanistan did not deliver a victory. The question now is: Can its departure allow for one?"

    "title": "Global Health Security: COVID-19 & Its Impacts Pandemic: The Idea of Social Resilience",
    "author(s)": "By Norman Vasu",
    "date": "No. 112 \u2013 5 June 2020",
    "content": "IT IS almost three months since the spread of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO). There are many lenses with which the scale of this cataclysmic event may be understood. For example, its impact may be understood through sobering metrics such as the current global death toll of 368,100; its negative impact on global economics; its destroying of social trust; and its impact on deteriorating mental health and increasing domestic violence to name a few. Given the scale of the political, economic, and social impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, this may be an opportune time to think through the manner in which social resilience has been conceived as a guiding principle through which society can respond to crises positively. Social Resilience Defined The concept of resilience has been employed in varied fields of research in the physical sciences. Understood broadly, resilience refers to an entity\u2019s ability return to its original state after exposure to external shocks. There are multiple examples of the term\u2019s applicability to the material world. For example, it is applied to describe a motorcycle\u2019s helmet ability to store and return energy without experiencing permanent distortion as well as the capacity of critical infrastructure to remain functioning after a cyberattack. Beyond the material world, over the past decade and a half, a growing research has emerged that applies the adjective \u2018social\u2019 to resilience. By doing so, the desire here is to conceive social resilience as a guiding principle for how society is to be organised to respond positively to a crisis. In the research, a positive response to crisis is to return to \u2018the way things were\u2019 post haste or a rapid adaptation to the crisis where society, in modern parlance, arrives at a \u2018new normal\u2019. COVID-19 and Social Resilience: Three Issues The ongoing experience of the outbreak has exposed three significant issues to be thought through for social resilience to continue to offer utility as a guiding principle to overcome crises. Returning to normal or a new normal? The challenge of COVID-19 has perhaps resolved the paradox within the concept of social resilience. The paradox in social resilience lies in its equal end states of striving for a return to normalcy while also being accepting of adaptation and change. In the sense of the former, it signifies toughness and resistance. In the sense of the latter, it also represents suppleness and flexibility. Hence, social resilience encourages, on the one hand, society's strive to overcome challenges with its tenets and institutions \u2013 the \u2018normal\u2019 \u2013 remaining intact. On the other hand, social resilience also promotes society's ability to cope with a demanding situation by modifying in innovative and novel ways. The virus has shown resistance to change demanding for a return to normalcy is doubtful at best. Instead, if social resilience is to continue to be a guiding principle of worth, societies should accept change as inevitable. At the risk of committing the predictive fallacy of assuming how things should be will become the norm, it can be stated it is highly likely that behavioural changes such as social distancing, the wearing of face masks, and the different degrees of monitoring of movement instituted owing to the virus will become the \u2018new normal\u2019. Unlike Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz, heels cannot be clicked to return to the comfort of an unchanged past. Different elements of resilience do not work together The reaction of members of society have shown that there is a possible friction between individual resilience and social resilience. For example, the hoarding of food and toilet paper in the early months of the pandemic was, as distasteful as it may be to state, a sign of individual resilience. Individuals who conducted such actions were performing somewhat reasonable mimetic isomorphism \u2013 the mimicking of behaviour at times of uncertainty. They were aping the action of others as they viewed such action essential for survival in a crisis. However, their action impacted negatively upon society as a whole, especially the vulnerable. Hence, while intuitively, the resilient individual and the resilience of society appear interrelated in a positive manner, it should be appreciated that the relationship is not one of linear addition. An increase in the number of resilient individuals may not lead to a corresponding increase in social resilience. Instead, there is a need to balance an individual\u2019s ability to be resourceful and adaptable to challenging circumstances with a community\u2019s ability to do the same. Social resilience is exhausting With the idea of bouncing back to normalcy promptly or adapting to a new state quickly, time has always been an important element of the principle of social resilience. Indeed, the length of lockdowns to halt the spread of the virus has brought to the fore how social resilience is intimately linked with time. With a growing frustration of lockdowns and its debilitating effects around the world emerging, the epidemic has uncovered how social resilience is a finite behavioural and attitudinal well that cannot be drawn from indefinitely. While most have accepted the positive benefits of an adherence to lockdowns, these lockdowns have brought to light the limits of collective endurance. Lockdown fatigue has emerged as an issue in society and this fatigue suggests effective measures to a crisis have to adjust to the level of compliance society at large is willing to endure. Moving Forward Does the concept of social resilience as a bulwark against crises weather the COVID- 19 storm? Arguably, it does. At its crux, social resilience offers hope in the form expressed by Albert Camus in The Fall, \u201csometimes, carrying on, just carrying on, is the superhuman achievement.\u201d While society undoubtedly has to carry on, what is required is a reconsideration of how the principle of resilience should be understood. The principle does not offer a panacea to all issues as change cannot be resisted, resilience is multidimensional, and the ability to conform to the demands of being resilient is finite."

In April 2021, Opposition Leader Anwar Ibrahim claimed that Selangor and Sarawak were being stonewalled by the federal government. Khairy Jamaluddin, Coordinating Minister for the National COVID-19 Immunisation Programme, countered that he had positively responded to state governments, which were free to acquire their own vaccines in coordination with the federal government. The Penang government in May 2021 took issue with the federal government denying its request to accept a vaccine offer from a private donor. Khairy claimed the offer was \u201ca scam\u201d. Vaccine Rollout Asian countries are confronting rising cases of more contagious and virulent COVID- 19 strains. But Malaysia\u2019s Perikatan Nasional (PN) government also has to contend with mounting political pressures from within its allies and the Opposition, which are magnified in federal-state tensions over COVID-19. It was reported that, in May alone, over 1,200 people died from COVID-19, accounting for nearly half the deaths since the beginning of the pandemic. Health Director-General Noor Hisham Abdullah has warned  that the situation is dire in Penang and Klang Valley \u2013 Selangor, Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya, where COVID-19 ICU beds are at overcapacity. The vaccine programme was launched three months earlier, on 24 February, with a target of 80% of the population vaccinated for immunity by 2021. Only 3.5% of the Malaysian population have been fully vaccinated as of 31 May. Khairy has attributed the slow pace to high costs and insufficient supplies of vaccines, with rich countries cornering the market. But the federal government was late in securing and approving vaccines. Malaysia secured its first vaccine deal in November 2020; in contrast, Vietnam had secured a deal by August. As of 30 May 2021, Malaysia has only administered a little over three million doses, slower than Thailand, Cambodia, and the Philippines. Earlier vaccine hesitancy has been replaced by demand surging past supply, heightening public frustration. Khairy has since announced that Malaysia will receive close to 16 million doses by July. Federal-State Disconnect As of 1 June, Selangor accounts for nearly 40% of the total cases in the country. The state has announced plans to procure 2.5 million doses of vaccines, while the other hard-hit states of Sarawak and Penang have announced their own vaccination programme plans. These states have the fiscal space to begin their own vaccine drives, while others are more dependent on the federal government. There have been several instances where states have gone against or ignored federal directives. The Johor state assembly, on the orders of the Sultan, was reportedly planning to convene to discuss efforts to improve measures against COVID-19, despite the suspension of the state\u2019s legislative powers under the country\u2019s current Emergency Ordinance. In late May, the Sultan also joined others, including Dr Mahathir Mohamad, pressing for a full lockdown. Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin had publicly rejected calls to do so, citing its massive economic cost. When the third Movement Control Order (MCO 3.0) was announced on 12 May, both Sabah and Sarawak opted to continue with their ongoing conditional movement control orders. Both states continue to impose varying rules under the new lockdown, adding to public confusion. Even data-sharing and transparency between Selangor and the federal government has been an issue. Selangor COVID-19 Task Force Chair and former health minister Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad has voiced his frustrations with the federal government. Political recrimination has severely undermined public confidence and cooperation and worsened the crisis, creating a vicious cycle. Malaysia has struggled with mass movement of people despite restrictions imposed, and has only been able to register around half of its target population for vaccination. New Political Dynamics The federal government has rightly sought to lead and coordinate national efforts to combat COVID-19 and secure vaccine supply. However, it must also identify when it should be flexible and contend with new political dynamics. The Selangor and Penang state governments are under the Opposition, which are keen to inoculate themselves from public unhappiness. Sarawak is under Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS), which is allied to but not part of the ruling PN coalition and is girding for an impending state election. PN has adopted a more targeted approach, but there is room for more state autonomy.  For instance, Sarawak MP Kelvin Yii has suggested that logistics for bringing vaccines to parts of rural Sarawak would be difficult, and thus, administering vaccines that only require one dose would be preferable. Different policies across states in other federations are not uncommon, such as in Germany and the United States where the central governments have mostly served to complement and support, rather than dictate, state laws and policies, including for COVID-19. Federal-State Relations Under Strain Malaysia\u2019s constitution heavily favours the federal government through unbalanced responsibilities given to the federal government, uneven revenue splits with state governments, and its ability to overrule state policies in the name of national interests. Some responsibilities are shared, including public health. States have sought to assert power in the past. The East Malaysian states (Sabah and Sarawak) have a long history of trying to regain their political autonomy. Resource and revenue sharing, specifically oil-production, has been a contentious issue for both, and Kelantan and Terengganu. With the rise and fall of the Pakatan Harapan government from 2018-2020, and the controversial succession of the PN coalition, federal-state relations and policy implementation have come under increased stress. Despite the PN government\u2019s firm handling of the first COVID-19 wave in 2020, it faced increased political challenge and eventually responded with the declaration of emergency and suspension of Parliament. This has allowed the PN administration to avoid being challenged but also removed a legitimising forum where political and public frustrations and feedback could be absorbed and used to forge consensus on COVID-19 measures. Malaysia\u2019s emergency allows the federal government to amend and create laws at the state level. The PN is leery of inflicting more pain to curb the virus decisively but a total lockdown was eventually imposed this week. The government now has to dramatically ramp up vaccination and push down COVID-19 cases, or face increasing challenges from allies and rivals, as well as influential states at the frontlines of combatting COVID-19."

    "title": "Rise of e-RMB: Geopolitics of China\u2019s Digital Currency",
    "author(s)": "By Dylan MH Loh",
    "date": "No. 117 \u2013 11 June 2020",
    "content": "AMIDST THE pandemic in late April 2020, China quietly trialled a digital currency, a sort of state-backed cryptocurrency, in four Chinese cities: Shenzhen, Suzhou, Chengdu and Xiong'an. Backed by yuan on a 1-to-1 basis, some public servants will receive a portion of their salaries in the e-renminbi (RMB), and participants will be able to spend it at selected retailers \u0336 with McDonald\u2019s and Subway some of the biggest names reportedly involved in the trial. A brainchild of the Digital Currency Research Institute, established within the People\u2019s Bank of China in 2017, this digital sovereign currency is formally called \u201cdigital currency and electronic payment\u201d or DCEP. What is Behind China\u2019s e-RMB One of the key impetus behind this digital currency was Facebook\u2019s own Libra cryptocurrency project \u2013 which is pegged to an as-yet undetermined basket of currencies. Fears that the RMB could be cut out from Libra\u2019s basket of currency set China\u2019s bankers thinking of a Chinese version. Li Lihui, the former president of the Bank of China and a key figure in China\u2019s digital yuan efforts, was surprisingly effusive in praising the Libra project. That notwithstanding, the contrast between the two could not be clearer. While the Libra coin sought to challenge governments\u2019 control and authority over legal tender, China\u2019s digital RMB sought to reinforce state control. As the Facebook-led Libra cryptocurrency project falters under the weight of regulatory oversight, China has moved decisively and quickly to trial and launch the digital RMB. There are at least three principal motivations behind China\u2019s drive to tokenise the RMB. First, by developing a sovereign digital currency, China is able to better track, monitor and ultimately prevent capital flows outwards. Beijing is well aware of the risks posed by sudden and large monetary outflows. In 2015, for instance, capital outflows amounted to an estimated US$1 trillion. More recently, there was a noticeable increase in capital flight, with the initiation of the trade war between the United States and China. Even with extensive capital controls (including bans on cryptocurrency trading), it is difficult to prevent capital leakage if one was determined enough. Because the digital RMB is administered centrally by the People Bank of China (PBOC), this ensures a robust supervisory architecture. In theory, this would mean that every single transaction and the data therein are available to the authorities, in real time. e-RMB as a Response to Bitcoin Second, the digital RMB is a response to Bitcoin\u2019s popularity in China. Indeed, Chinese nationals turned increasingly to cryptocurrencies (in particular, Bitcoin) for speculation but also to dodge capital controls. The liquidity, security, anonymity and decentralised nature of Bitcoin was perfect for moving vast sums of money, undetected and relatively quickly, outside Chinese borders. Most alarmingly to Beijing\u2019s eyes, is the potential of cryptocurrencies to usurp the money-printing capabilities (and relatedly, its financial legitimacy) that only states, hitherto, possessed. The \u2018trustless\u2019, decentralised nature of (most) cryptocurrencies now meant that central banks around the world, had to live with and manage a parallel financial universe developing right before their noses, but without their oversight. The Chinese response was to ban the trading of cryptocurrencies completely. Yet, Beijing was savvy enough to convert the best aspects of cryptocurrencies to serve state goals. This includes potentially banking the millions of unbanked Chinese citizens; reducing transaction costs for businesses; reducing friction in peer-to-peer payment; easier cross-border payments; and allowing a more hygienic option to pay. In any event, it is important to remember that these considerations are ultimately beholden to Beijing\u2019s demands for greater supervision over its currency and its financial system. Digital Yuan and Regionalisation of RMB Third, the advent of a digital yuan (if widely adopted and implemented), could compete with the US-denominated settlement system. It would also make attacks and speculation of the renminbi much harder. In the words of the PBOC governor, Yi Gang, China\u2019s digital yuan \u201cprovides a functional alternative to the dollar settlement system and blunts the impact of any sanctions or threats of exclusion both at a country and company level\u201d. Moreover, one of the stated ambitions of the digital RMB is to regionalise the currency and tie it into China\u2019s expansive BRI project. While the RMB global appeal may be limited for now, it is not improbable to countenance the eventual widespread acceptance of Chinese digital sovereign currency in the region. South Korea, for one, has already indicated that it may accept digital RMB from Chinese tourists. Given that Chinese payment platforms such as Alipay and WeChat are already closely integrated into payment systems across Asia, it seems like a matter of time before the regionalisation of the digital RMB takes off. What Does This Mean for Regional Norms? Locally, the digital yuan (because of the instantaneity and magnitude of data collected) would allow authorities to better construct individuals\u2019 and businesses\u2019 credit and social scores. This would accelerate ongoing efforts to quantify and evaluate people\u2019s trustworthiness on a much broader and deeper way. It will give a booster shot to China\u2019s ability to monitor economic cycles more accurately, but critics will decry the potential intrusiveness and power of the e-RMB to surveil and monitor its citizens. China is the first major power to test a digital currency. It has the competence, will, resources and political capital to rapidly scale it nationally and, eventually, regionally. Seen in tandem with its moves in the BRI, the political and diplomatic implications of the digital RMB cannot be missed. For instance, could Beijing make it a requirement for recipient countries needing investments or loans to accept the digital RMB? Will this spur states to expedite their own versions of digital sovereign currencies? Will the e-RMB be used to spread influence and shape regional norms of financial governance? Will China leverage on this to gain political and diplomatic leverage in other domains? How will this help innovate and disrupt cross-border transactions? These are questions that countries in the region will need to seriously grapple with."

    "author(s)": "By Jefferson Ng and Quah Say Jye",
    "date": "No. 032 \u2013 19 February 2021",
    "content": "INDONESIA\u2019S RECENTLY passed omnibus law contains sweeping deregulation measures aimed at spurring economic growth and job creation. However, these deregulation measures are expected to accelerate the loss of forest cover, make the country more vulnerable to climate change, and could lead to significant economic losses. Indonesia is one of the world\u2019s largest emitters of greenhouse gases. Carbon emissions have risen by more than 300% since 1990, largely a result of massive deforestation and coal burning. Deforestation has been fuelled by the plantation economy, especially palm oil production and peat burning, with loss of forest cover estimated at six to eight per cent of global emissions. In addition, Indonesia has vast coal reserves, and with installed coal-fired capacity set to double in the next decade. Furthermore, Indonesia is extremely vulnerable to climate change. Climate Change Impacts Average temperatures in Indonesia are expected to increase 0.8\u00b0C by 2030. More extreme weather, in combination with deforestation, will increase the risk of drought, forest fires, and flooding. In mid-January, heavy floods struck South Kalimantan, leading to the evacuation of more than 48,000 people. This unfortunate event was a combination of abnormally high rainfall and the degradation of the Barito river watershed due to plantation and mining activities. Besides the socio-ecological costs, climate change extract significant economic costs. Part of the reason for the expensive plans to relocate the capital from Jakarta to East Kalimantan (estimated at US$33 billion) is due to predictions that large parts of the city could be submerged by 2050. Jakarta alone accounts for around 30% of national GDP. Many Indonesians also base their entire livelihoods on agriculture and fishing, both of which would be severely affected by the unpredictable weather patterns. If left unmitigated, Indonesia could face losses of 132 trillion rupiah (US$9.4 billion) by the year 2050 due to the reduction of agricultural production, public health costs, and impacts of sea level rise. Omnibus Bill on Job Creation and Environmental Degradation President Joko Widodo has stated that the top priority for his second term is boosting economic growth. As a result, while he claims they are important, he has put environmental issues on the back seat. The Omnibus Bill on Job Creation, the Jokowi administration\u2019s signature national development strategy, is meant to stimulate job creation and Indonesia\u2019s \u2018ease of doing business\u2019. In short, it is a set of deregulation measures meant to attract investments from abroad, by simplifying the business permit process, centralising regulatory authority in the hands of the national government, and modifying laws deemed to hamper foreign investments. Some of these measures have the potential to increase environmental degradation in Indonesia. For instance, the bill erases a statutory safeguard that requires 30% of the forest area in all watersheds and islands to be preserved. It also allows certain businesses to simply submit a statement declaring compliance to environmental standards, removes the involvement of community representatives and experts on the environmental assessment committee, and removes the legal avenues for objecting and challenging environment assessments and approvals. These amendments are highly controversial. When set against the government\u2019s biodiesel policy, which does not require palm oil producers for biofuel production to adhere to international certification standards, the weakening of environmental safeguards and community participation is likely to contribute to an increase in deforestation and environmental degradation. Untapped Renewable Energy Potential Indonesia\u2019s physical geography provides it with options to pursue more sustainable forms of growth. The government needs to accelerate efforts to utilise its considerable wind, geothermal, hydropower, and solar energy reserves for sustainable long-term growth. Indonesia hosts over 130 volcanoes and stores around 40% of the world\u2019s total geothermal reserves - most of it untapped. Analysts also point out that the Indonesian government has vastly underestimated its capacity to develop solar power. Lying on the equator, Indonesia receives abundant sunlight compared to most other countries. To develop renewable energy sources, the national government needs to facilitate private sector investments into projects by developing a financing regime and legal framework that is attractive to investors. According to a draft presidential regulation prepared last September 2020, the government plans to help investors of renewable energy to recoup their capital through a feed-in tariff scheme to be phased over 30 years. A draft law on New and Renewable Energy is also on the National Priority Legislation Program for 2021. Accelerating the adoption of such policies can allow Indonesia to change course. Examples from neighbouring countries demonstrate that with adequate political will to direct investments, a swift transition to a lower carbon economy is possible. Vietnam managed to jump from generating 0.134 GW to 4.5 GW of solar energy in just 12 months. There are also significant economic benefits. Studies have also shown how government spending on renewables can create three times as many jobs compared to investments into coal and gas. Leapfrogging Old Developmental Models The effect of climate change and environmental degradation can intersect and magnify the environmental and economic costs. Mitigating and adapting to these challenges require Indonesia to establish and implement a holistic environmental policy that recognises these interactive effects. Furthermore, it is easier to make course corrections earlier than later. Based on Indonesia\u2019s current trajectory, it is unlikely to achieve its pledge of reducing its carbon emissions by 29-41% under the Paris Accords by 2030 to address the longer-term threat of climate change. Rather, it is doubling down on a statist growth strategy that is likely to be environmentally damaging and difficult to reverse. While Indonesia faces huge environmental and climate change challenges, it also has an opportunity to leapfrog old developmental models. An important component of this solution is to accelerate the adoption of new and renewable technologies. There should also be a periodic review of the Omnibus bill and the national development strategy to account for its environmental impact."

    "title": "EU Indo-Pacific Strategy: More than Meets the Eye",
    "author(s)": "By Frederick Kliem",
    "date": "No. 074 \u2013 3 May 2021",
    "content": "THE RISE of the \u201cIndo-Pacific\u201d is a reflection of geo-economic and geo-strategic change, similar to the emergence of the \u201cAsia-Pacific\u201d in the 1990s. It also pressures all stakeholders to adopt a strategy accounting for new geo-political circumstances, the latest of which, on 19 April 2021, is the Council of the European Union\u2019s draft guidelines for an EU Strategy for Cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. This is to be finalised by the Commission later this year. The strategy foresees a stronger strategic EU presence and greater contribution to stability, security and sustainable socio-economic development of the Indo-Pacific. As can be expected from a self-identified normative power, EU norms and values take centre-stage, as does its envisioned role as a cooperative partner to all regional powers to jointly work towards upholding international law and \u201csoft\u201d objectives subsumed under the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. A Paper Tiger? The easiest \u2014 not entirely unjustified \u2014 criticism one can level against EU foreign and security policy (CFSP) in general and this strategy is that it is a paper tiger. Ever since the United States officially identified the Indo-Pacific as its main strategic theatre, endorsed a very robust Indo-Pacific strategy, and upgraded the so-called Quad to a quasi-alliance, the battle-lines were drawn around China as the problem. Naturally, the comparatively mild EU strategy has been \u2014 not incorrectly \u2014 criticised by observers for its ambivalence and soft stance on China, potentially disappointing its key partners in the region, who take a much stronger position. Instead, Europe was appeasing China, or at least evading the problematic China question. Instead, rather than a shortcoming, EU strategic ambivalence is a strength. A more appropriate comparison is ASEAN\u2019s Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP). Despite being very different organisations, in terms of foreign policy and the China question, the EU faces challenges similar to ASEAN, resulting in a vast expectation-capability gap. In terms of foreign policy, the EU is not an actor but a platform for coordination of its members\u2019 national interests and policies. And just like Southeast Asia, Europe contains a wide range of national interests, threat perceptions and dependencies. Consequentially, one should not expect a united strategic reorientation beyond what has long been EU\u2019s Asia policy anyway. Likewise, one might criticise that the EU strategy does not address China. In fact, it even regresses from once calling China a \u201csystemic rival\u201d. But while many members are concerned about both the strategic and normative challenges China poses, for most this is symbolism rather than a political priority. Europe\u2019s Priorities The largest member, Germany, is generally normatively conscious, but that its economy is doing reasonably well despite COVID-19 is predominantly a function of a large manufacturing sector capitalising on a continuously strong Chinese market. One should not expect that the Council would suddenly \u201cget tough\u201d on China \u2014 especially in a document as strategically loaded as an Indo-Pacific strategy. Likewise, as important as non-traditional security is, security status is measured in \u201chard-power\u201d currency. Despite a justified anticipation of greater EU presence following this strategy, a dose of realism and expectation management is in order. Brussels bureaucrats are not going to become security-relevant actors in the Indo- Pacific theatre. While some may point to the deployment of national (French and German) military assets, this does not demonstrate EU but national power. Lastly, although the German foreign minister recently repeated the common clich\u00e9 that \u2018the future lies in Asia\u2019, from a European perspective this is misleading. Economically, Asia is the present, and has been for a long while \u2014 nothing has changed here. In strategic terms, this is grossly misrepresenting Europe\u2019s priorities, which are not shifting to East Asia but firmly remain where they have been for centuries: Russia and the Near East. China and the Indo-Pacific are at most in the top-four strategic concerns. EU-ASEAN: Making a Difference But similar challenges also offer similar opportunities. Kissinger once remarked that a purely military definition of balance in Asia will eventually shade into conflict. This is where such reputable actors as ASEAN and the EU can make a difference. They can conceive of a concept of partnership and cooperation, potentially offsetting the worst consequences of hard-power balancing. Just like AOIP, the EU strategy provides a second way to conceive of the Indo-Pacific, seeing it as distinctly inclusive not exclusive of China. By proposing to focus on common challenges and capacity building, AOIP presented a real alternative to the Quad members\u2019 hard power focus. It also invited all stakeholders to make better use of the existing multilateral architecture in order to manage their differences and mediate great power estrangement. The EU is now unambiguously lending ASEAN its support in precisely these areas. EU A Relevant Global Actor Additionally, notwithstanding the obvious lack of military capabilities, the EU is a relevant global actor. This is predominantly a function of its weighty, indeed supranationally organised, common market and trade policy. But the EU is also heavily invested in the Indo-Pacific in terms of diplomacy, non-traditional security questions, and regional multilateralism. The EU is the largest contributor to ASEAN integration \u2014 larger than ASEAN members themselves \u2014 and a living example of the benefits of regional multilateralism. The EU can at times serve as a valuable reference point, and Brussels has the power to meaningfully influence the future of trade rules and standards in the region. Europeans also have great expertise in and experience with ecologically and financially sustainable infrastructure development; something the region is in dire need. It is very promising to note the prominent role of infrastructure development in the EU Indo-Pacific strategy, coupled with an emphasis on partnerships and multilateralism. There is great potential in synergising with AOIP. But expectations ought to be managed and the EU must focus on what it is good at."

    "title": "Global Health Security Nuclear Technology & Disease Prevention: What ASEAN Can Do",
    "author(s)": "By Julius Cesar Trajano",
    "date": "No. 049 \u2013 25 March 2020",
    "content": "MANY COUNTRIES, including several ASEAN member states, are struggling to test more people for the COVID-19 while facing a shortage of detection kits. In March 2020, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) announced that it will provide diagnostic kits, equipment and training in nuclear-derived detection technique for any member states requesting support as they grapple with the spread of COVID-19. To move this forward, the US Government has recently provided the IAEA with US$6 million voluntary contribution, which will be used by the IAEA to provide requesting member states with COVID-19 testing kits and training. The IAEA has now received requests from around 60 member states and is ready to train their scientists. Plugging the Gap: Lack of Testing Kits The nuclear-derived diagnostic technique, known as Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), can help detect the novel coronavirus accurately within hours in humans, as well as in animals that may also host it. This may be a promising method for testing. It has been used in the rapid detection and identification of viruses that are causing some of the world\u2019s most dangerous diseases in the recent past, such as Avian Flu, Ebola and Zika. Whether it would be effective in detecting COVID-19 once it is widely used by states should be further investigated. For over 50 years, the use of nuclear techniques in medicine and nutrition has become one of the most extensive peaceful applications of nuclear technology. The development of nuclear-derived detection kits by the IAEA exemplifies the crucial role of other international organisations (an example is the Food and Agriculture Organisation or FAO), apart from the World Health Organisation (WHO), in times of global health crisis. The IAEA cooperates with the WHO and other key partners to assess the current level of knowledge about COVID-19, identify gaps and work, where it can contribute, in the multilateral approach to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Plugging the Diagnostic Gap There is also a large diagnostic gap in the global health response owing to the global shortage of testing kits. RT-PCR can help address this. While it will not totally solve the global shortage, the nuclear-derived technique may help countries increase their supply of coronavirus testing kits and equip many other countries which currently do not have their own detection technique and capability. The WHO has urged all countries to test every suspected case and ramp up their respective detection capabilities. From 30 March - 9 April 2020, scientists and veterinary experts from the countries concerned will be trained by the joint IAEA-FAO team to use the RT-PCR with the needed testing kits. This effort is aimed at improving their surveillance and response capabilities to the outbreak and their preparedness for future ones. The focus is on early detection of viruses. The prevalence and global implications of pandemics compel other international organisations to contribute to the efforts of the WHO. While the IAEA is a specialist body with expertise in nuclear technology for peace and development, it does not have a broad mandate on health. It does, however, have the mandate and capability to transfer technology to help save lives. For instance, the IAEA responded quickly to the Ebola crisis in West Africa in 2014 through providing nuclear-derived diagnostic kits and laboratory supplies for use in the field. In 2016, the IAEA, in partnership with the FAO, assisted member states to deploy sterile insect technique, a mosquito control system, that uses radiation to help stem the Zika outbreak. This latter technique is also used now to combat other mosquito- borne diseases. The collaborative initiatives of the IAEA and FAO underscore the key role of other international organisations, apart from the WHO, in stemming the spread of COVID- 19 and other diseases that can lead to epidemics or pandemics. The participation of other international organisations fits into the multifaceted nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications. Undeniably, they all must not work in silos as they address a global pandemic, while fulfilling their respective mandates. What Can Southeast Asia Do? The region\u2019s expertise in nuclear applications in public health is not lacking. Local expertise, as a result of decades of research and training, has grown steadily as demonstrated recently by the Vietnamese authorities controlling the spread of African Swine Fever using nuclear-assisted technique in 2019. Higher education plays an essential role in nuclear capacity building that includes nuclear applications in disease surveillance and prevention. Despite the absence of nuclear power plants in Southeast Asia, several universities and knowledge centres in the region continue to offer institutionalised academic programmes and research activities in nuclear sciences and engineering. Indeed, the role of nuclear technology in public health, especially in producing testing kits in times of disease outbreaks and pandemics, reflects the importance of maintaining and even investing more in the region\u2019s nuclear education programmes. ASEAN member states, especially those that have very limited testing coverage and capability, could tap into the assistance offered by the IAEA so as to benefit from nuclear technology applications in disease surveillance and prevention. Way Forward Currently, the Philippines, Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand will receive training assistance on the utilisation of RT-PCR. The ASEAN-IAEA Practical Arrangements on the peaceful uses of nuclear technology, signed in 2019, would be a useful framework for knowledge and technology transfer to Southeast Asian nations. Furthermore, ASEAN member states can maximise the burgeoning cooperation among their nuclear regulatory bodies through the ASEAN Network of Regulatory Bodies on Atomic Energy (ASEANTOM). Another area of growing cooperation is by the regional centres of excellence on nuclear security and safety. The applications of nuclear technology in disease surveillance ought to be regularly included in training programmes/courses, workshops and other modalities of knowledge sharing amongst these regional institutions. Regional states have to decide whether and how to utilise the nuclear-derived detection technique and seek the IAEA\u2019s support. They also have to determine how this technique can strengthen the detection and response measures of countries once it is rolled out globally. This is not only for the COVID-19, but also in dealing with other communicable diseases that may break out in the future."

    "date": "No. 009 \u2013 13 January 2020",
    "content": "THE POLITICAL earthquake in Malaysia that brought Pakatan Harapan (PH) into power on 9 May 2018 also shattered the glass ceiling for women in government. PH outperformed its predecessor, Barisan Nasional (BN), in appointing more female politicians in the cabinet and across key institutions. Malaysia saw its first female chief justice, Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat; first female deputy prime minister (DPM), Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail; and first female anti- corruption chief commissioner, Latheefa Koya. Including the deputy premier, PH has five female ministers (Zuraida Kamaruddin, Teresa Kok, Yeo Bee Yin, and Rina Harun) and four female deputy ministers (Hannah Yeoh, Teoh Nie Ching, Fuziah Salleh, and Isnaraissah Munirah Majilis), who hail from the Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR), Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (PPBM), the Democratic Action Party (DAP), and the Sabah Heritage Party (Warisan). Advancing on Gender Equality? This is certainly significant progress for gender equality, especially in an Asian society that remains largely conservative. Notwithstanding, this progress is insufficient, going by the Inter-Parliamentary Union. As of 2019, Malaysia ranks 143rd out of 190 countries on women\u2019s representation in national parliament, according to IPU. In ASEAN, Malaysia stands third from the bottom, above Myanmar and Brunei. Notably, Malaysia has been one of the longest stable democracies with regular parliamentary elections in ASEAN. In the 2018 general election, both PH and BN did not disregard the importance of women in politics. Their manifestos pledged to uphold a 30 percent quota of female representation in federal and state governments. However, this stands as yet another unfulfilled promise of Pakatan Harapan. Women\u2019s political representation is crucial for Malaysia\u2019s aspirations to become a high-income nation that is inclusive and democratic. As a signatory of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), Malaysia is also obliged to accelerate the increase of its low female representation in politics. Political Leadership & Gender Balance in Malaysia Women\u2019s political leadership is critical for gender equality and social justice, as they more often voice and address issues relating to women and families. The benefits extend to broader society. Studies illustrate that a gender balance in the political domain promotes gender balance in the workforce, which increases GDP growth. Female political leaders are also likely to place higher budget allocations for health and education. Additionally, research by the UN Women has demonstrated that women at negotiation tables tend to increase cooperation across ethnic lines and political parties, champion social issues, and resolve national crises without resorting to violence. In Malaysia, there has been a positive trend in the fielding of women candidates, albeit a slight one. The proportion of women candidates nominated in the 2013 general election was at 10.7 percent. This figure rose to 14.4 percent in the 2018 general election \u2500 BN fielded 92 female candidates out of the total 727 contested, PH fielded 85 out of the total 660, and PAS fielded 36 out of the total 548. In February 2017, then deputy prime minister, Zahid Hamidi, suggested that the push for women\u2019s representation had been rhetorical all along, stating: \u201cI will find a way so that this 30 percent request is achieved. Enough of talking rhetorically.\u201d But the transition from rhetoric to implementation continues to be a complex process. Challenges for Female Political Progression Voluntarily adopting the 30 percent quota would mean all political parties have to nominate sufficient female candidates. However, the current overwhelming majority of male incumbents are expectedly reluctant to yield their seats to women. Since the nomination process is opaque and predominantly controlled by male gatekeepers, the mechanisms of how candidates are selected within parties pose challenges for women. Women politicians have observed that it is not rare for male politicians to curb the nomination of women. In most cases of women parliamentarians, such as those in UMNO, PAS, PBB, PKR, and DAP, they have indeed been sifted by these male gatekeepers. It is not unusual for these women to be beholden to their male patrons. In fact, a number of these women have echoed disapproval of the 30 percent quota. According to them, such quotas are undemocratic. They believe that women who appeal to be fielded on the grounds of their sex are not incentivised to legitimately compete on their merit. Some female political elites, on the other hand, have adopted the practice of women-centric clientelism to disrupt the monopoly of male gatekeepers. Senior female politicians allocate positions and resources to their female prot\u00e9g\u00e9s in exchange for their political loyalty. However, there are only a few women in state and federal cabinets, thus few have access to the patronage networks and can engage in clientelism. In any case, patronage politics is inherently problematic and does not comprehensively tackle the issue. As reported by several women MPs, the electoral system is another impediment to raising the number of female political leaders. Elections in Malaysia follow the first- past-the-post (FPTP) electoral system. Constituencies are divided among members of a coalition. These component parties can only contest a limited number of constituencies. Hence, as limited candidates can be fielded, parties tend to favour experienced incumbents to win the seats, who are usually male. This promotes the status quo of male dominance. Feasible Solutions? To promote inclusive representation, PH called for electoral reform during the 2018 general election; there are also debates to replace the FPTP electoral system with proportional representation (PR). The PR system enables a party to field multiple candidates in multi-member constituencies. Research shows that PR is effective in increasing the likelihood of more elected women. However, this reform is an ambitious long-term goal at best. In the short term, the measure of a \u201cwomen-only-additional-seats\u201d (WOAS) within the FPTP system is the least contentious and arguably the most politically viable route of accelerating women\u2019s political representation. WOAS provides non-constituency seats and proportionally allocates them after elections to all parties, based on their share of votes. Appointed female members each receive a seat at the state assembly. This does not threaten the seats of male incumbents. The constitutions of certain states in Malaysia allow for this special provision. Such allocations hold potential for upholding representation from minority groups. For states that do not have these provisions, amendments can be debated and passed at state assemblies, without the need for these bills to be tabled in the federal parliament. 30 Percent Quota? This is unlike enforcing the legislation of a minimum 30 percent quota of female candidates for federal and state elections that requires a constitutional amendment in the federal parliament, and a two-thirds majority to pass. The WOAS was implemented in Terengganu in November 2018, with the appointment of the state\u2019s first woman assemblyman, Zuraida Noor, who was secretary of the women\u2019s wing of PAS. Before this, the state executive committee was consistently an all men\u2019s line-up. The WOAS measure can help to highlight the value and capability of female leaders. However, it should only be explored as a temporary measure, rather than a substitute for equal representation. Women\u2019s political representation will likely increase in the next election, but political leaders, both men and women, and the government need to take more proactive steps to enhance the size and quality of this representation."

    "author(s)": "By Alexander R Arifanto and Jonathan Chen",
    "date": "No. 047 \u2013 17 March 2021",
    "content": "ONE OF the main trends in Indonesian politics in the past few years is a resurgence in the number of retired military and police officers running as candidates for local governments upon retirement from their uniformed positions. The influence of both security institutions in the civilian realm has increased since President Joko Widodo (known popularly as Jokowi) assumed office in 2014. Jokowi deployed the Indonesian Armed Forces (TNI) frequently to assist his administration in various duties. Having won another mandate in 2019, Jokowi delegated more duties to the TNI, including mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic that had affected Indonesia the past year. More Officers Going Into Politics Meanwhile, the National Police (POLRI) had been entrusted by the president to handle internal security challenges faced by the administration, such as counter-terrorism and mass protests sponsored by hard-line Islamist groups such as the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), which has renamed itself as the Islamic Brotherhood Front (FPI). (The Jokowi administration formally prohibited FPI on 30 December 2020). A growing number of retired TNI and POLRI officers had also delved into national politics, and in greater capacities, competing as candidates for regional executive elections. According to a new study by RSIS\u2019 Indonesia Programme, 55 retired former TNI and POLRI officers ran as regional candidates in local elections held between 2015 and 2020. A total of 21 former officers sought office during the last round of regional elections held in December 2020. However, as highlighted in the following case studies of retired police officers running in the mayoral elections in Surabaya and gubernatorial elections in North Kalimantan province, getting elected as regional government officials in Indonesia is not a straightforward affair even among candidates who were formerly senior POLRI or TNI officers. So how did the former officers perform as candidates for regional politics? The Surabaya Mayoral Election Out of four police generals who participated in the 2020 regional elections, only one (Zainal Arifin Paliwang of North Kalimantan) won. In our case studies of Surabaya and North Kalimantan province, factors that account for electoral success at the local level were often at odds with national level perceptions. Retired Inspector General (two star) Machfud Arifin, although a native of Surabaya and a decorated police chief who served in three provinces, lost the mayoral election to Ery Cahyadi, who was formerly the head of the city\u2019s Budget Planning Bureau. While Machfud managed to obtain support from eight political parties represented in the city\u2019s legislative council, Ery won the support of the Indonesian Democratic Party Struggle (PDI-P) \u2013 the largest political party in the council. Ery was also endorsed by Tri Rismaharini, the city\u2019s popular outgoing mayor. His running mate and now deputy mayor is Armuji, a veteran PDI-P politician who was the speaker of Surabaya\u2019s legislative council for 17 years. Ery\u2019s mayoral campaign is also helped by the informal alliance between the PDI-P and Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), Indonesian\u2019s largest Islamic organisation. Both organisations command a sizable support from the city\u2019s population, with approximately 60 percent of the city\u2019s Muslims affiliating themselves with NU. Ery\u2019s wife is the daughter of a cleric who runs the Tegalsari pesantren (Islamic boarding school) \u2013 the largest NU- affiliated pesantren in the city. Machfud was not able to overcome the PDI-P/NU alliance which backed Ery and was able to turn out more voters at the polling booth on 9 December 2020. Ery managed to win the mayoral election, with a margin of 57.5 percent versus 42.5 percent. The North Kalimantan Gubernatorial Election In North Kalimantan province, a different scenario elapsed. Retired Police Brigadier (one-star) General Zainal Arifin Paliwang, was elected as the province\u2019s new governor during the December 2020 election. He won 45.5 percent of the vote, defeating the incumbent governor Irianto Lambrie, and incumbent deputy governor Udin Haggio in a three-way contest. Zainal, an ethnic Bugis from Makassar, had a career trajectory that was almost similar to Machfud Arifin \u2013 having held positions as police chief and director in Sulawesi, Yogyakarta, West Java, West Nusa Tenggara, Bali and Riau before becoming deputy police chief of North Kalimantan province prior to his retirement. Zainal had paired up with Yansen Tipa Padan, an ethnic Dayak and ex-regent of Malinau district. The Zainal-Yansen pair was supported by eight political parties including big-wig parties PDI-P and Gerindra. The candidate pair tapped into the discontent of residents over the lacklustre development of the district since the province\u2019s inception in 2012. They promised greater infrastructural development including a connecting bridge to the provincial mainland. In addition, Yansen\u2019s association as a native-born Dayak and Zainal\u2019s affinity as ethnic Bugis amongst the majority South Sulawesi pendatang or migrants, played in their favour. Local Politics Matter Other retired police generals who became candidates during the 2020 Simultaneous Regional Elections (Pilkada Serentak) also suffered electoral losses. Retired Inspector General (two star) Syafril Nursal, a native of Jambi and ex-police chief of Central Sulawesi province, lost to Ratu Munawaroh \u2013 wife of the ex-governor of Jambi \u2013 in a three-way contest. Retired Inspector General (two star) Fakhrizal, a native of Bukittinggi and ex-police chief of West Sumatra province, courted controversy when he was accused of utilising his privileges as police chief for his own gubernatorial campaign. As a result, he came in third in a four-way contest. While a candidate\u2019s standing and background matter in any electoral contest, what stands out in the electoral failures of these retired ex-police chiefs is a lack of a keen sense of the context and habitus of local politics. Knowledge of political dynamics, a dedication towards the cultivation of local elite networks, the ability to win support from prospective voters and even the strategic pairing of running mates are crucial factors for electoral success. Thus, the refrain \u201call politics is local\u201d could not be more relevant than ever at the sub-national level in Indonesia."

    "title": "BRI's 'Debt Trap Diplomacy': Reality or Myth?",
    "author(s)": "By Pradumna B Rana and Ji Xianbai",
    "date": "No. 191 \u2013 4 November 2020",
    "content": "THE GEOSTRATEGIST from India, Brahma Chellaney, is frequently credited with having coined the term \u201cDebt Trap Diplomacy (DTD)\u201d in 2017. Chellaney opined that the aim of China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) was to saddle small nations with debt that they could not hope to repay \u201cleaving them even more firmly under China\u2019s thumb\u201d. Since then, based on a review of a limited number of cases and projects, many other commentators and analysts have come up with similar views on the BRI. The DTD thesis has, therefore, morphed into something approaching conventional wisdom. World Leaders\u2019 Use of DTD Thesis The DTD thesis has also been widely used by world leaders. For example, in 2018, United States Vice President, Mike Pence, referred to the imperative to provide \"foreign nations a just and transparent alternative to China\u2019s debt-trap diplomacy\". A bipartisan group of 16 US senators in August 2018 also expressed apprehensions about the BRI by citing \u201cthe dangers of China\u2019s debt-trap diplomacy\u201d. They noted that it was imperative that the US counters China\u2019s attempts to hold other countries financially hostage and force ransoms that further its geopolitical goals. Leaders in Japan and Australia which together with the United States and India comprise the Quad (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue forum), also frequently use the term. A recent research paper authored by Lee Jones and Shahar Hameiri from Chatham House, a London-based international affairs think tank, offers a robust challenge to the DTD thesis. Jones and Hameiri argue that the BRI portrays a reality that is both messier and more nuanced. They find that oftentimes controversial BRI projects were initiated by recipient governments, and the perceived debt problems arose mainly because of the misconduct of the local elites. However, their focus is on the experience of only two countries, Sri Lanka and Malaysia, a very small subset of over 165 countries and international organisations that have signed the BRI memorandum of understanding (MOU) or other cooperation agreements with China. DTD a Myth? In our recent book, China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative: Impacts on Asia and Policy Agenda, we conducted an online perception survey of opinion leaders (defined as policymakers, academics, and representatives of businesses and media) from a wide range of stakeholder countries, 26 Asian countries that have signed the BRI MOU with China. Stakeholder participation and perception are important for the success of a BRI project. Also, it is the stakeholder country that is ultimately responsible for repaying BRI loans to China. Opinion leaders from Japan, Australia, and India were excluded from our survey as they have not yet signed the BRI MOU. China was also excluded for obvious reasons. Over 1200 opinion leaders responded to our survey questionnaire. We also simulated a computable general equilibrium model, and conducted regional case studies to assess other economic impacts of the BRI. The key findings of our book challenge the DTD thesis on three grounds: \u2022 First, after having considered both the benefits and costs of the BRI, on balance, 41.6% of the respondents to our survey of stakeholders believed that the BRI represented a net benefit for their countries, while only 14.8% said that it was a net cost. 40.6% noted that it was too early to tell. The strongest endorsements for the BRI came from Bangladesh (64.5%), Pakistan (59.7%), and Nepal (58.8%), while the opinion leaders from the Philippines were the least receptive to the BRI. The Korean, Myanmar, and Vietnamese opinion leaders took a more neutral stance saying that it was too early to ascertain whether the BRI was a net opportunity or cost to their respective countries. \u2022 Second, on the DTD thesis itself, more than 42% of the respondents to our stakeholder survey rejected the narrative as \u201calarmist\u201d, although it is important to bear in mind that 30.6% felt otherwise. More than a quarter (27.3%) of the respondents had not made up their minds as yet. Echoing the conclusions of the Chatham House report, some respondents noted that domestic factors which were in the purview of host governments (such as corruption and reckless propensity to borrow) were responsible for rising debt levels rather than Chinese BRI financing. For instance, one opinion leader remarked that \u201cDTD happens when weak governance is married with international borrowing\u201d. Like the Chatham House report, yet others felt that China\u2019s financial system was too fragmented and poorly coordinated for it to pursue detailed strategic objectives such as ensnaring countries in debt traps. \u2022 Third, using the methodology developed by the Center for Global Development in Washington DC, which focuses on the level of public and publicly-guaranteed debt to GDP ratio, we found that three out of the five South Asian countries for which data are available are presently facing debt distress. These are Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Maldives. However, Sri Lanka owes more to Japan than to China (only 3%). The country also borrows extensively from international capital markets (54%). Similarly, Pakistan owes more to multilateral development banks and Islamic creditors (34%) than to China (only 6%). Maldives appears to be an exception, but the country has been at a high risk of distress for at least a decade, with or without the BRI. COVID-19 and BRI\u2019s Future Summing up, in contrast to the views of many commentators and analysts, our recent book finds that although there are a large number of implementation issues confronting the BRI, the DTD thesis is more a myth rather than a reality. Presently, because of the ongoing pandemic, many BRI projects are on hold and a number of BRI countries are facing difficulties in servicing their debt obligations to China. China is helping these countries to restructure their debt including through partial debt forgiveness. China will not let the BRI collapse as this project, labelled as the \u201cproject of the century\u201d by President Xi Jinping, marks the country\u2019s re-emergence in the global scene and its eventual ascent to be the number one economy in the world. The success of the BRI could also spell good news for Asia as a whole. The BRI has the potential to convert \u201cMaritime Asia\u201d into \u201cContinental Asia\u201d which will herald the \u201cRenaissance of Asia\u201d as the global centre of economic and political gravity."

    "title": "Global Health Security: COVID-19 and Its Impacts Migrant Workers: Wake-Up Call for Malaysia",
    "author(s)": "By Khor Yu Leng and Johan Saravanamuttu",
    "date": "No. 081 \u2013 30 April 2020",
    "content": "THE SPIKE in new infections of COVID-19 in Singapore, due to the large presence of foreign workers living in dormitories in the city state, is a wake-up call to other countries with a large migrant labour force. Singapore's frank reporting of the virus spread among its foreign worker community has alerted neighbouring countries. In Malaysia, possibly even more reliant on foreign workers (legal or documented and illegal or undocumented) to do its manual and unpopular jobs, the situation can be precarious. Warning Bells Having kept the spread of COVID-19 under control, the world was awakened by Singapore\u2019s announcements within a couple of days (around 8 April 2020) that a quarter of its key purpose-built dormitories for the foreign labour force would be put under quarantine. The virus had been spreading with clusters at construction sites and the popular Mustafa 24-hour department store in Little India. Singapore has moved aggressively on mass testing of foreign workers and this has pushed up its case count which put it at the top of infection tables in East and Southeast Asia. As at end of April 2020, Singapore registered 16,169 cases, mostly among foreign workers accommodated in dormitories. Three countries in Southeast Asia \u0336  Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand \u0336  have the lion\u2019s share of migrant workers in the region, housing among them some 96 percent of the total. Singapore has slightly more than a million semi-skilled and unskilled foreign workers (excluding domestic helpers), 323,000 of whom are housed in 43 dormitories. Malaysia has the highest number of the three countries, with 2.2 million documented workers and possibly another three million who are undocumented according to industry talk. Now, officialdom in Kuala Lumpur openly talks of an all-in total of six million. Thailand has about three million migrant workers coming from neighbouring Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. The foreign workers of Singapore and Malaysia come from Southeast Asia and South Asia. While the Singapore foreign worker situation is predominantly an urban phenomenon, those in Malaysia are dispersed in the urban economy and the plantation sectors of the economy. The Singapore situation points to some crucial lessons to contain the COVID-19 pandemic among migrant workers for Malaysia and Thailand. Lessons from Singapore Migrant workers basically serve the larger community, the elite and middle-class consumers of their host countries by taking up jobs in construction, essential services and plantations which locals avoid; especially at the prevailing wages. Ironically, it is the middle-class travellers and globe-trotting elites of their host countries who may have brought the virus into their ranks. Herein lies the core problem; while social distancing is more easily implemented in middle-class communities, such social distancing and even basic hygiene may not be so easily practised in the crammed dormitories, low-cost apartments and other poor facilities which house migrant workers. Singapore\u2019s containment strategy will likely yield results soon because of the island\u2019s tight governance and its efficiency in controlling social behaviour; especially its ability to segregate affected communities. Deaths per million from COVID-19 at only two in Singapore is among the lowest in the world and the overall number of cases, while still spiking, looks likely to come down. Singapore\u2019s measures to contain the virus is premised on social distancing in worker dormitories. Those working in essential sectors have been separated from their (mostly) construction sector brethren into disused army camps and public housing flats earmarked for redevelopment. For those in construction, they are housed in different locations through arrangements with their respective employers. News media reported two hostel ships, used by offshore workers in the oil and gas sector, were also deployed. The use of additional accommodation areas is apparently aimed at rapidly reducing the residential density of foreign worker dormitories. Situation in Malaysia and Thailand How have Malaysia and Thailand dealt with its migrant workers, which currently have not appeared much in statistics on the virus? If the problem is not properly contained the presence of large migrant worker communities in both these countries could be a time bomb for the virus to explode exponentially. The poor living conditions of migrant workers would be the very circumstances that will prove to be the grim prelude to the third wave of COVID-19 infections in Southeast Asia. Or did Malaysia lock down in the nick of time, from 18 March 2020? Malaysia\u2019s Ministry of Health has announced a mass testing plan for higher risk populations in high risk zones. The closure of areas near the Selayang wholesale market in Kuala Lumpur is notable; and results seem benign so far with 74 positive cases found among 15,000 tests (for 18,000 locked down as of last week, with foreigners making up 90 percent of the count). South Korean test kits are reportedly arriving in Malaysia. Malaysia has millions of migrant workers in the urban sector living in informal dormitories, including in low cost flats. The foreign diplomatic missions from where the workers originated were told to provide meals for the affected workers since the lockdown. Malaysian authorities and NGOs have provided additional support. Malaysia also has hundreds of thousands of foreign workers in the plantation and agriculture sectors. Industry sources often cite their high, 80-90 percent reliance on foreign workers. It is notable that for developed countries the level of reliance averages 16 percent, and in the likes of Germany 30 percent of agricultural workers are seasonal migrants. No Clear Plan of Action on Migrant Workers So far both Malaysia and Thailand have yet to reveal any clear plan of action regarding migrant workers. Merely going by the number of tests, both countries lag well behind Singapore at 20,815 per million. To date Malaysia has conducted 4,701 per million and Thailand has recorded 2,551 per million (29 April). Some Malaysian businesses have reported that the instinct of their foreign workers is to leave for home as they expect no support from their host countries following the economic shutdown. The Indonesian Foreign Ministry reported that over 34,000 of about two million Indonesian migrant workers in various sectors returned home after Malaysia set travel restrictions. Those in the rural sector may be better off as agrifood is an essential sector with ongoing operations, and residential densities are expected to be lower. For those sectors at a halt, a number of companies are delivering food supplies, and they are now eyeing the back-to-work rules including virus screening by the Social Security Organisation or SOCSO (an agency under the Ministry of Human Resources). But what about the millions of illegal/undocumented workers? As warned by Glorene Das, executive director of the Tenaganita women and labour rights organisation, a fresh wave of COVID-19 infections among migrant workers was \"of grave concern\u201d because there has been inadequate testing among Malaysia\u2019s widely dispersed millions of migrant workers in urban and rural settings. An exodus of tens of thousands of migrant workers back to Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar when Thailand announced its lockdown in late March created alarm and concern about the poor protection accorded to such workers. The question still arises as to what the situation is of the millions still locked down within Thailand\u2019s borders and how widespread the incidence of coronavirus is among them."

    "title": "Pro-IS Home-Based Schooling in Indonesia",
    "author(s)": "By V. Arianti and Ahmad Saiful Rijal",
    "date": "No. 164 \u2013 28 August 2020",
    "content": "IS SUPPORTERS have administered tens of home-based schools, mostly in Java, according to estimates by PAKAR, an Indonesian NGO that studies radicalism in Indonesia. They name the schools Rumah Qur\u2019an (RQ), which literally means Qur\u2019anic House. It is technically a \u201cboarding school\u201d run in a house where the students live and study in a cramped environment. Depending on the capacity of the house, a pro-IS RQ can accommodate eight to two dozen students, either single or mixed genders (segregated) in one compound. How are the schools grooming the potential \u201ccubs\u201d of IS, also known as ISIS? Assessing the School\u2019s Curriculum Based on the publicly available social media accounts of some pro-IS schools, they offer tahfidz (memorising the Qur\u2019an) programmes. However, their curriculum appears to be beyond merely memorising the verses. In essence, the schools offer religious classes with a Salafi curriculum. Two subjects highlighted as core subjects are Arabic language and Tawhid (Islamic Monotheism). According to the posts, Arabic language is important in order to understand the Holy Quran as well as the Prophetic Tradition while Tawhid is central to a Muslim\u2019s faith. While both subjects are traditionally important for all Muslims, the Salafi doctrinal orientation emphasises a rigid understanding of Tawhid that requires the abolition of all manifestations of shirk (polytheism), bara\u2019 (disassociation) as well as takfir (excommunication) of so-called polytheists. It is important to note that Salafism is not the root cause of terrorism; however for IS, it is pivotal for them to plant the seeds of antagonism towards the \u2018enemies\u2019 of Islam by exploiting certain religious concepts such as the Salafi doctrine of takfir. The latter has been used to legitimise the IS\u2019 killing of Muslims as well as others. As a result, IS supporters who run the RQs in Indonesia have co-opted Salafi principles as their correct theological approach to Islam. \u201cNullifiers of Islam\u201d Much has been discussed about the idea of Caliphate espoused by IS and how it has managed to attract fighters across the world, but the concept of \u2018nullifiers\u2019 of Islam legitimises the atrocities that IS has committed against Muslims. This idea forms the basis for IS to isolate and excommunicate Muslims for supposedly not adhering to the \u2018true\u2019 teachings of Islam. Pro-IS schools have adopted the book titled \u201cPembatalan Islam\u201d as the core reference for the study of Tawhid, the fundamental principle of monotheism in Islam. The book is a translated treatise known as \u201cThe Nullifiers of Islam\u201d written by Muhammad ibn \u2018Abd al-Wahhab, the founder of the Islamic doctrine known as Wahhabism. According to \u2018Abd al-Wahhab, as explained by the scholar Shaikh Abdullah an-Najmi, this set of ten nullifiers can invalidate one\u2019s religion and good deeds. If a person commits any one of these nullifiers and his good deeds become void, he will be relegated to the rank of unbelievers. One of the nullifiers notes that \u201cWhoever does not excommunicate the polytheists, or is doubtful about their unbelief, or affirms the validity of their doctrine \u2013 he is an unbeliever by consensus\u201d. Among the posts by the home-based pro IS schools, one argues that parents who love their children should let them study Tawhid instead of Mathematics, English and National Civic Education. This is because they are the next generation of Muwahhid (monotheist). This term Muwahhid has been used by IS in its propaganda videos as well as publications. It refers to those who not just profess God\u2019s unity but also those who perform jihad against the enemies. In another post, a screenshot of a related WhatsApp group highlighted the achievement of some students who have completed several topics on Tawhid based on a booklet called \u201cAlwaajibat\u201d (the obligatory upon Muslims), also written by ibn \u2018Abd al-Wahhab. The post mentioned that it is imperative to educate the young against the polytheistic peril of modern times \u2500 such as democracy and other forms of political systems which do not recognise Sharia law. Such posts have garnered a lot of \u2018likes\u2019 and \u2018comments\u2019 among its followers. Slowing Growth of Militant \u2018Cubs\u2019 The number of pro-IS home-based schools will likely grow as the administrators aim to establish more such schools across the country. Law enforcement agencies are not able to arrest such growth as the administrators of the schools are not technically involved in terror acts. The home-based pro-IS schools have attracted both parents who are supporters of IS and parents in the local neighbourhood who are not IS supporters. Just as parents involved in Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), the largest jihadi group in Indonesia, enrol their children to study at JI schools, IS parents and supporters would see such schools as important institutions to instil IS values in their children. Moreover, children of the pro-IS followers who are detained and slain pro-IS militants are sponsored by pro-IS charity groups when they go to such schools. For the unsuspecting non-IS parents, who live in the vicinity of a pro-IS school, they may be enticed by the school\u2019s claim that it offers the \u201ctrue\u201d teachings of Islam. To slow the creation of a new generation of militant \u2018cubs\u2019, more needs to be done to stem the growth of such schools if they purvey values that are antithetical to the security of the country. The Indonesian government and civil society organisations could mitigate it by first, ensuring that the children of radical inmates and slain militants do not study at those schools. This would help to stop the cycle of radicalism within IS families. Second, there should be general education within the community about such schools, especially among unsuspecting parents who merely want a religious education for their children."

Lander is a mathematician and geneticist who helped map the human genome as well as president and founding director of the Broad Institute jointly run by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. At the same time Biden elevated this dual-hatted position to cabinet level. Biden also appointed a Princeton social scientist Alondra Nelson as the deputy chief science advisor. To co-chair the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology, Biden nominated Frances Arnold and Maria Zuber. Arnold is California Institute of Technology\u2019s chemical engineer, an expert in protein engineering and the first US woman to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Zuber is MIT's geophysicist and the first woman to lead a NASA spacecraft mission. She has also chaired the National Science Board. Biden is keeping Francis S. Collins, current director of the National Institutes of Health as a member of the Science Advisor Team. Significance of the Elevation By elevating the chief science advisor and director of the OSTP to the president\u2019s cabinet, the new administration is clearly planning to give science and technology a much bigger role in strategy and policy development. This is timely given the myriad challenges facing the United States. Biden has already tasked the Science Advisor Team to focus on five key areas: combat public health threats; mitigate the impact of climate change; keep the country a world leader in innovation; use science to improve social equity; and strengthen the US research enterprise. The OSTP director leads interagency science and technology policy coordination efforts to advise the president on the scientific, engineering, and technological aspects of the economy, national security, homeland security, health, foreign relations, the environment, and the technological recovery and use of resources, and other areas. As the position of presidential science advisor/director of OSTP is elevated to the cabinet rank, Lander needs to be confirmed by the Senate. This dual-hatted position did not have to go through Congress confirmation in the past. U-turn from Trump\u2019s Science Policy The elevation of the science advisor and director of OSTP to cabinet-level marked a U-turn from the science policy of the former president Donald Trump who spent much of his term downplaying scientific data and evidence. His unilateral pullouts from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Paris Climate Accord have damaged international scientific cooperation and the health and safety of the human race. He also pushed for the promotion of coal and fossil fuels and the elimination of environmental regulations. He downplayed the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic by telling the country not to worry about the coronavirus because it was \u201cmild\u201d and \u201clike a flu\u201d. He regularly rejected public health guidance. Trump\u2019s repeated public dismissals of scientific expertise, and his disdain for evidence have prompted the US National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine to issue a joint statement in October 2020 that \u201cPolicymaking must be informed by the best available evidence without it being distorted, concealed, or otherwise deliberately miscommunicated\u201d. Even though the joint statement did not name Trump, it was clearly aimed at the then president. In contrast, Biden signed executive orders to rejoin the Paris Climate Accord and re- engage the WHO on his first day in office. He plans to re-direct an unspent fund in the Department of Energy for clean energy, followed by trillions of dollars to achieve net- zero emissions on the power grid by 2035 and economy-wide by 2050. For the COVID-19 pandemic, Biden vowed that \u201cour administration will lead with science and scientists from the Centre for Disease Control, National Institutes of Health and Food and Drug Administration, totally free from political influence whose decisions are based on science and science alone\u201d. The new administration also plans to apply science to helping fix America\u2019s appalling inequalities of income and race. The level of expectations for the US returning to its former prominent role on global climate policy, healthcare research, environmental protection has risen around the globe. Long Lasting Impacts? Whether future administrations keep the presidential science advisor and director of OSTP a Cabinet rank remains to be seen but the Biden administration is the first one in US history to do so; it is determined to make science and technology its main theme to re-energise the science, technology and innovation in the US. The first science advisor, Vannevar Bush, served Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman from 1941 to 1951. Bush essentially expanded the role for government in research and pressed for the creation of the National Science Foundation. Prior to that, research was largely a philanthropic activity that existed in parallel with education. There was not really a large government role in scientific research. During the postwar period, a number of federal research organisations were created including Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Defence Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). These organisations have laid the foundation for space exploration, integrated circuits, computers, Internet, global positioning systems, and other science-related breakthroughs that we all enjoy the benefits of today."

    "author(s)": "By Zi Yang",
    "date": "No. 014 \u2013 22 January 2020",
    "content": "WUHAN, A municipality of 11 million in Central China, reported its first case of viral pneumonia on 12 December 2019. Later confirmed to be caused by a novel coronavirus with 89 percent similarity to the SARS coronavirus, those with the illness show symptoms such as lung lesions, fever, fatigue, dry cough, and difficulty in breathing. According to most recent official Chinese statements, a total of 319 people have been infected with the novel coronavirus and six fatalities have been reported. On 19 and 20 January 2020, Chinese officials announced that Beijing and Guangdong have confirmed novel coronavirus cases have spread beyond Wuhan to 17 regions across China. The actual source of infection remains unknown. Human-to-human Transmission? An earlier World Health Organisation (WHO) announcement, based on information coming out of China, underlined that the disease did not appear to be spreading and there was no sustained human-to-human transmission. On 21 January, China officially confirmed the deadly coronavirus can spread from human to human. A 17 January report by the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London showed an estimate of up to 1,700 infected individuals in China, indicating possible underreporting by local governments. So far, six confirmed novel coronavirus cases have been detected outside of China. Two in Thailand and one each in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the US.In Singapore, seven travellers have been quarantined. All have tested negative. From 22 January onwards, Singapore will isolate all travellers from China with pneumonia. China\u2019s Response to the Outbreak The Chinese government\u2019s response to the outbreak has been swift. Chinese state media publicised information regarding the unexplained pneumonia on 31 December, two and a half weeks after the first case was reported. On 1 January, a Wuhan seafood market, said to have sold wildmeat linked to the outbreak was shut down for clean-up and disinfection. 922 people who had close contacts with affected individuals are being closely monitored. On 9 January, Chinese state media announced that scientists have generated a full genetic sequence of a novel coronavirus through samples from infected individuals. The genetic sequence of the coronavirus was publicly released two days later. In mid-January, foreign specialists were invited to Wuhan to exchange information on the situation. Yet despite the quick response, transparency remains a serious issue. As mentioned previously, there is a severe underreporting regarding the number of infected persons. Information control has been tight. Chinese authorities issued warnings to those spreading online \u201crumours\u201d regarding the disease and police have questioned individuals about this issue. In total, China\u2019s containment effort has been proactive but opaque. International partners are kept informed, but the quality of information is dubious. Although the release of a trove of information in recent days indicate a possible turn towards transparency, legacy of the SARS outbreak 18 years ago still shadows responses of today. Responding to SARS 2002\u20132003 The first case of what later became known as SARS was reported in mid-November 2002. However, news of the case was quickly silenced. In the meantime, the disjointed Chinese bureaucracy spent enormous amount of time figuring out what to do. Bureaucratic differences led to slow and ineffective response, while the disease spread. Information about the outbreak was hidden from the world until the following February, 2003 when the Chinese government reported the outbreak to WHO and its own citizenry for the first time.However,WHO specialists were not allowed to visit the site of the initial outbreak until early April 2003. As growing outside pressure and insider revelations forced the government to act, it finally agreed to full cooperation with WHO in April 2003, and a concerted nationwide effort went underway to contain the spread of SARS. Although the outbreak came to a close in August 2003, SARS eventually spread to 26 countries, infecting a total of 8,437 people, and led to 813 deaths. China and Hong Kong suffered the most deaths, respectively 348 and 298 victims. ASEAN nations suffered as well. There were 206 confirmed SARS cases and 32 deaths in Singapore, 63 cases and five deaths in Vietnam, five cases and two deaths in Malaysia, nine cases and two deaths in Thailand, and 14 cases and two deaths in the Philippines. The Chinese government\u2019s handling of SARS was roundly criticised as clumsy and irresponsible. In the years following the crisis, the government invested heavily in public health infrastructure, a modern disease reporting mechanism, and promised greater transparency regarding contagious diseases. Implications for ASEAN In sum, China\u2019s approach to the outbreak has been different from its response to SARS, but transparency remains a major issue that could undermine international containment effort. In recent days, the Chinese government has released more information regarding the disease, perhaps responding to pressure from the MRC Centre report and domestic critics who fear a SARS redux. ASEAN nations, taking a cue from the past, are upping the monitoring of travellers coming from Wuhan, China. With the approaching Lunar New Year holiday season, a large influx of Chinese visitors to Southeast Asia is expected. The confirmation of human-to-human transmission means greater precaution is needed. Besides strengthening health checkpoints at border entries, ASEAN states must urge China to be more transparent in its response to the coronavirus outbreak. To protect their citizens, ASEAN states should do the following. First and foremost, clearly communicate to the Chinese government the need to regularly share outbreak information. Specifically, the Chinese government must provide truthful information on the number of infected individuals and cities in China where outbreaks have been reported, so ASEAN states can properly prepare countermeasures. Second, seek cooperation with Chinese health counterparts through existing channels in containing the disease. There are several established public health cooperation mechanisms between China and ASEAN that can be utilised for this purpose. Finally, work closely with international organisations on the issue and draw upon their expertise.Such cooperation between ASEAN, China, and international organisations are very much needed, given that the transnational flow of Chinese visitors to Southeast Asia will soon increase dramatically in the coming days."

    "title": "Rise of Violent Christian Extremism: Whither Inter-Religious Ties?",
    "author(s)": "By Paul Hedges",
    "date": "No. 027 \u2013 11 February 2021",
    "content": "THE 16-YEAR old youth recently detained under the Internal Security Act (ISA) is the first far-right Christian extremist detained in Singapore. The planned attack on a mosque and self-radicalisation of a Christian are not entirely unexpected. The threat of what is often loosely termed the \u201cfar-right\u201d is a global one, and this Singapore example of an ethnic Indian Protestant Christian shows that it extends beyond what might be seen as a \u201cwhite\u201d agenda. As Singapore (and ASEAN) considers its CVE (countering violent extremism) strategy, it needs to be aware that this goes beyond the threat posed by militant jihadism. While the inspiration for this youth seems to have been the Christchurch attack of 2019, with the catalyst being an attack in France last year, there are multiple sources of far-right anti-Muslim sentiment within the South and Southeast Asian context. As such, \u201cwhite\u201d far-right extremism, including claimed Christian identity, is just one factor in the potential for such violence. While diffuse, \u201cfar-right\u201d as a marker is often used widely to refer to diverse groups, ranging from White supremacists to the ethno- religious Buddhist, Hindu and also violent Christian extremists. Anti-Muslim Resentment To mention some examples, the ISIS-inspired attack in Sri Lanka in 2019 has further stirred existing Buddhist animosity towards Muslims \u2013 who have been scapegoated by militant Buddhist extremists in the aftermath of the civil war against the Tamil minority. This in turn created distrust amongst Christians too, who previously often found common ground with Muslims. In Myanmar and Thailand, particular vectors have seen prejudice stoked against Muslims. Again, in India, far-right militant Hindu extremists have come to view Muslims as their most potent enemy. Different far-right Islamophobic groups are also working together. The Hindu militant far-right, for instance, has been developing ties to far-right networks in Europe and America, and has a heritage in Italian fascism. In media representations, Muslims tend to be portrayed, often sweepingly and unthinkingly, as those most likely to be involved in terrorism and violence. In truth, many innocent Muslims are the victims of attacks both by militant jihadis and far-right violent extremist groups from the other faith communities, be they Buddhist (as seen in Myanmar and Sri Lanka), Hindu (in India) and Christian in Europe, the United States, and New Zealand. Examples of such violence extends from direct killings such as the Christchurch attack to violence against individual Muslims in terms of beatings and assault, and prejudicial policies such as then US President Donald Trump\u2019s ban of travel from predominantly Muslim countries. Therefore, some argue, Muslims are the group who suffer most from global terror attacks. The Far-Right Threat and Global Terrorism Far too often, CVE has been disproportionately aimed at Muslims, with the threat of the far-right ignored. In what we may broadly term Western nations, various events \u2013 from the Christchurch attack, to the storming of the US Capitol, and the murder of a British parliamentarian \u2013 have made the threat of far-right violent extremism more obvious and part of both the media, political, and security services agenda. That Singapore picked up this individual at the planning stage is fully to its credit. It recognised that an Indian Protestant Christian inspired by the far-right could be just as much a threat as somebody profiled as a \u201cMuslim\u201d. Gearing CVE policing to more directly focus on the far-right needs to happen, and globally this does seem to be the direction of such policies which is good. The threat is global. The media also play a key role in how they speak. While there are dangers of stoking fear, an acknowledgement of use of the term \u201cterrorism\u201d to describe attacks committed by the far-right is needed. Social media and Internet companies, as well as traditional media, also play a key role in what is allowed on their sites and in the level of vetting of content that takes place. Looking Ahead: Role of Religious Communities Singapore\u2019s Home Affairs & Law Minister K. Shanmugam is right to suggest that religious buildings should not become \u201cfortresses\u201d. To some extent, the securitisation of buildings and societies means terrorists have succeeded in instilling fear. Religious communities must also speak together, and in Singapore Muslims and Christians were side-by-side condemning the action of the 16-year-old Christian youth. This display of unity is important in countering enmity narratives. In a UK case study, a 2010 planned march through the London borough of Tower Hamlets by the English Defence League left many Muslim youths afraid that \u201cthe Christians are coming to get us\u201d. But an interfaith counter response that saw local Christian priests on stage with Muslim leaders speaking against this march helped local Muslims realise that this was not the case. Symbolic displays of unity can be key, more so than statements or speeches from one side. Plans for joint action by religious communities to tackle online radicalisation and extremism is also to be welcomed. Singapore is also to be commended for subjecting the individual detained to counselling, both religious and psychological. In many places radicalisation in jail is a problem, with examples of radicalised inmates influencing others and even hunkering down further into such worldviews. Moreover, the only long-term solution is through rehabilitation, which will involve in such cases religious narratives. While Singapore has got much right in its response to this case, it has made very real the long-posited global threat \u2013 including in this part of the world \u2013 from far-right terrorist actors, including those of the ethno-religious kind. While the Christian youth is a lone wolf, and caught before acting, the possibility for inspiring copycat acts must not be overlooked. Moreover, both mainstream populist political actors and extremist ideologues continue to see traction in spreading prejudiced Islamophobic narratives. The very real possibility that this is not a one-off event must therefore be taken seriously."

    "content": "THE PHILIPPINE government declared on 16 March 2020 the entire Luzon island to be under \u201cenhanced community quarantine\u201d \u0336 a subtle term for a total lockdown \u0336 to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. Terrorist activities in Mindanao of the Southern Philippines, however, remained unabated. Though local governments extended quarantine measures, the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), continued their kidnap-for- ransom operations, ambuscades, bomb-making, and other militant offensives. On 17 April 2020, the ASG killed eleven and wounded 14 soldiers of the Philippine Army in a firefight in Patikul, Sulu. The ASG ambushed the Philippine soldiers while they were conducting their hot pursuit operations against followers of Radullan Sahiron and Hatib Sawadjaan, two top ASG leaders in Sulu. Most Devastating Attack The incident on 17 April in Sulu was the deadliest attack of the ASG since the Jolo Cathedral suicide bombings in January 2018. The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) said that the attack was \u201cthe most devastating encounter for the military in a long while\u201d. The encounter occurred a month after Mindanao was placed under quarantine due to COVID-19 threats. The Office of the President of the Philippines released a statement exclaiming: \u201cWe condemn in the strongest possible terms the latest incident in Patikul, Sulu, where members of the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) believed to be under ASG leader Radullan Sahiron and Hatib Hadjan Sawadjaan attacked government troops resulting in a firefight, which left 11 soldiers killed and 14 wounded.\u201d The following day, on 18 April 2020, the Philippine military resumed its operations against the ASG. The operations resulted in a firefight with the ASG in Talipao, Sulu where a certain Vikram, the grandson of Sahiron, was killed. Vikram, who was on the military\u2019s wanted list because of his involvement in the Jolo Cathedral suicide bombings, was an expert on the manufacture of improvised explosive devices (IEDs). On 23 April, another clash took place between the ASG and the Philippine Army in Patikul. Six ASG members died during the encounter but only three ASG members were identified namely Guro Khalid, Udal Muhamadar Said, and a certain \"Budah\". Eight soldiers suffered wounds in this incident. Sabah on Security Alert While implementing security measures against COVID-19, the Eastern Sabah Security Command (Esscom) placed the Malaysian state nearest to Sulu on high alert by beefing up its land and sea patrols to prevent the spillover of recent violent activities from Sulu. In fact, amidst the outbreak of COVID-19 in March 2020, the ASG in Sulu planned to conduct kidnapping operations in Sabah. On 30 March, Malaysian intelligence had alerted the International Maritime Bureau (IMB) Piracy Reporting Centre about the intention of the ASG to carry out kidnapping activities in Felda Sahabat and Tambisan areas. Need for Rethinking of Strategies As demonstrated by its past and recent activities, the ASG is operating not only in the Philippines but also in the tri-border areas of Southeast Asia covering the Sulu Sea, Sabah and Sulawesi Sea. There is currently the Trilateral Cooperation Arrangement among the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia on patrolling their shared maritime borders against piracy, terrorism and kidnapping. There is, however, a need to level up the existing arrangement as it is not fully deterring the ASG from conducting its usual illegal activities even during the pandemic. With the combined threats of terrorism and the COVID-19 pandemic in the Southern Philippines and Sabah, the Philippines and Malaysia need a rethinking of their existing strategies to combat security threats. Terrorists worldwide are now exploiting the COVID-19 situation to further justify their violent extremist activities. They have adapted to the pandemic to persist in propagating violent extremism. Thus, the world is bound to face multiple virulent threats. With this new situation, it is paramount for the Philippines and Malaysia to lead other members of ASEAN to formulate a coordinated regional response to combat multiple threats posed by terrorism, the pandemic, and others associated with them. Without a coordinated regional response, Southeast Asian countries will find it difficult to combat these threats not only in the region but most importantly at home."

    "author(s)": "By Chris Cheang",
    "date": "No. 137 \u2013 3 July 2020",
    "content": "this week overwhelmingly voted for major constitutional A REFERENDUM amendments that would, among other things, allow President Vladimir Putin to run again for re-election after he steps down in 2024. If he wins, he can remain in power till 2030; should he run again and succeed in the 2030 elections, he will be in power until 2036, when he must step down. Most of the amendments revolved around increasing the power of the State Duma in approving the candidacy of the prime minister and his cabinet, as well as making the Russian constitution take precedence over international law. The most significant clause, however, relates to Putin\u2019s political future; it removes the \u201cin-a-row\u201d provision, discounts previous terms in office as president, and nullifies the number of terms served by the incumbent president. Surprise Clause, Expected Outcome Almost 78% supported the amendment package while a little over 21% voted against it; turnout was 65%. The outcome was expected. If one compares it with his 2018 presidential election victory (68% turnout, 77% of the vote), it shows his widespread popularity has not been as dented as observers had believed. The clause relating to Putin\u2019s political future was proposed by Valentina Tereshkova, the well-known first woman cosmonaut in space, in an apparent unexpected move in March 2020. When Putin supported her proposal before the State Duma, it laid to rest long-held speculation about his plans for his own political future. Other noteworthy clauses relate to social welfare: the minimum wage cannot be lower than the subsistence minimum and there is to be regular indexation of pensions. Another significant change is the clause defining marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman. Indeed, these social welfare clauses are targeted at the majority of Russian voters, given the social protection and guarantees these clauses offer to the majority working class. Moreover, the clause on recognising traditional marriage satisfies the conservative moral values of most voters as well as the powerful Russian Orthodox Church. Predictably, the State Duma, Federation Council and Constitutional Court approved all the proposed amendments. The whole package of constitutional amendments was to be have been decided upon by a referendum on 22 April 2020; however, it was postponed to 1 July 2020 due to the outbreak of COVID-19 in Russia. Clearer Succession? The referendum\u2019s outcome was unlikely to have been manipulated or falsified. Despite the deleterious impact of COVID-19 on the Russian economy, voters are aware of the absence of a real alternative to President Putin in 2024. The clauses relating to social welfare and traditional marriage were key to ensuring that the constitutional amendments would be supported by the majority of voters. The referendum\u2019s outcome allows President Putin to theoretically run for office again in 2024, for another two terms \u2500 till 2036. Of late, he has not ruled out running for re- election. A TASS news agency report dated 21 June 2020 quoted him as saying that \"I have not made any decision so far. I'm not ruling out that I will stand for [election] if this emerges in the Constitution. We'll see.\" The report added that he cautioned Russian officials against searching for a successor to him now. \"They need to work rather than search for successors,\" Putin was quoted as saying. His purpose in putting forward the constitutional amendments appears therefore not so much to prolong his political future to 2036 but to ensure that he will not be reduced to a lame-duck president, as his comments above show. He has also recently remarked that it was not healthy for Russia to have a system like the Soviet era when leaders died in office. He has taken this unprecedented step to ensure that he could turn over the reins of power to a hand-picked successor without too much worry, perhaps after re-running and winning the presidency in 2024. Mikhail Mishustin: Putin\u2019s Likely Successor At this point in time, his likely successor remains Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin. Mishustin has the technocratic credentials to fully and successfully implement the important National Projects to raise GDP. COVID-19\u2019s negative impact on the economy has placed an additional obstacle on Mishustin but he and his technocratic team are more than competent to handle the challenge. They have enough resources to manage the adverse impact of COVID-19 on the economy. Russia\u2019s international reserves currently total US$566 billion. It has relatively low foreign debt (about 15% of GDP), and can afford to borrow, if necessary. Economic growth into the future is modest but encouraging. The government\u2019s latest projection is that GDP would contract by 4.8% in 2020, and then grow by 3.2% in 2021, 2.9% in 2022 and 3.1% in 2023. (The IMF, however, has estimated a decline of 6.6 % for 2020). Mishutin does not have any known links to Russia\u2019s powerful interest groups such as the siloviki or top security establishment officials and heads of powerful state corporations. President Putin need not balance the interests of these groups; were he a member of either of them, he would have to spend political capital and time on such a task. Mishutin would not be seen as \u201cold wine in a new bottle\u201d by the electorate. In this regard, he fits the bill of having new faces at the helm of power. A political unknown, he is not considered a threat by either President Putin or the powerful interest groups. Putin would be more at ease handing over power to Mishutin who would be expected to protect him from any political retribution. (On assuming power, President Putin granted his predecessor total immunity from prosecution. Putin would expect the same treatment from his successor). But Will President Putin Run Yet Again? Ultimately, whether Putin runs again for office in 2024 depends on the following factors. Much would revolve around how the economy develops, and in the immediate term, how Russia manages the COVID-19 crisis and the effects of the oil price fall on its economy. Should the non-systemic opposition leaders (outside the loyal opposition in the State Duma) become a real alternative to him, then President Putin might be forced to seek re-election. At this stage however, it is unlikely that his political opponents could mount a real challenge. They are not united, lack a coherent policy programme, weakened by official pressure, and do not enjoy widespread popular support. The state of his health is also a factor; at 67, he is still in fine fettle and can be expected to remain so, given his spartan habits and love for sports. The rise of competent leaders, other than Mishustin, who might prove capable and whom he can trust and elevate, cannot be totally ruled out. Finally, the state of relations with the European Union and the United States as well as China will be an important consideration. Should these ties enter into a crisis, President Putin would run for re-election. Only time will tell if he would seek to remain in power till his eighties. He has a keen sense of destiny and would not relinquish power, if doing so would endanger his legacy and Russia\u2019s well-being."

    "date": "No. 192 \u2013 5 November 2020",
    "content": "IN 2015, China and Pakistan forged strategic links with the signing of the China- Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) agreement. This major tie-up provides Beijing with vital access to the Arabian Sea, while adding an extension to China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Pakistan, on its part, benefits economically from the CPEC as it connects to about 58 projects worth about US$62 billion: eight projects to develop Pakistan\u2019s Gwadar port, city and airport in Baluchistan, 21 coal, hydro and solar power plants, power transmission lines, highways, railways and a fibre optic cable project. China saw an economically prosperous and stable Pakistan as politically advantageous and wanted to create a geostrategic connectivity corridor from its resource-rich Muslim Xinjiang province to Pakistan\u2019s Gwadar city and port. CPEC 2.0 Gwadar is strategically important because of its closeness to the Strait of Hormuz, the junction of vital international sea shipping routes. For China, the construction and administration of coal-fired power plants within CPEC were good alternative business opportunities for its state-owned enterprises abroad at a time when coal-fired power in China plant projects are being scaled down because of President Xi Jinping\u2019s stronger focus on sustainable power supply. The previous Nawaz Sharif government and Imran Khan-led administration hoped that projects with Chinese technological know-how and money would help upgrade Pakistan\u2019s industrial infrastructure and revitalise its economic development. Pakistan\u2019s perennial power shortages and power transmission losses have been major challenges for every Pakistani government. the present CPEC power plants were to provide a fast remedy. At Pakistan\u2019s request China\u2019s investments were predominantly in coal power plants. A tax-free Gwadar deep sea port was expected to turn it into a trade and transport hub. Before his election in 2018, Prime Minister Khan pledged to renegotiate CPEC projects. However, the majority of projects was continued. PM Khan recently pledged \u201cto complete CPEC at any cost\u201d when he launched the second phase of the megaproject dubbed CPEC 2.0 in mid-2020. He also increased the military\u2019s role in the CPEC governance when he appointed retired army general Asim Bajwa as chairman of the newly created CPEC Authority. Bajwa was tasked to push ahead with stalled CPEC projects. Even though Pakistan managed the COVID-19 pandemic comparatively well, its economy suffered. Work on CPEC has resumed since June 2020. In spite of Pakistan\u2019s problematic fiscal situation, new contracts were recently signed for two hydropower and the Mainline1 railway projects worth $11 billion. In July, a controversial CPEC Authority Bill was introduced, granting the military comprehensive powers and reducing the role of civilian government. In spite of recent corruption allegations against Gen. Bajwa, PM Khan retained him as CPEC chairman. Progress and Problems Information on the progress of CPEC projects is opaque. Some projects have been subdivided into different stages, some shelved or are still without financial closure. PM Khan claims \u201csubstantial progress\u201d. Observers guess that a quarter of the projects have been completed, among them nine power projects (worth $7.9 billion). Nine projects (worth $9.5 billion) are being constructed (four coal power, four renewable energy plants and a coal mine). The Gwadar projects are advancing, the Lahore Metro line and part of the Peshawar-Karachi Motorway have been completed. Pakistan faces a vicious cycle of high debt liabilities. Its total debt and liabilities surged to 106% of GDP in 2020 since PM Khan took office. Domestic debt has risen by 35% to about $135 billion. Its foreign reserves have been falling to a low of $13 billion. Its GDP contracted by 2.8 per cent in 2019/20. In 2019 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a $6 billion loan but demanded \u201cdecisive fiscal consolidation to reduce public debt\u201d. In March 2020, PM Khan asked China for a moratorium on its loans to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic. China announced on 7 June 2020, a suspension of debt repayment for 77 developing countries, including Pakistan, under the G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative until December 2020. Pakistan also borrowed $1 billion in 2020 from China to refinance a $6.2 billion loan it had secured from Saudi Arabia in 2018. \\ Pakistan received $4.2 billion from the IMF, ADB, World Bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to tie it over the COVID-19 situation. It is estimated that Pakistan owes China between $22 and $30 billion, constituting the largest portion of its external debt it owes to one country. A dangerous debt spiral is looming. Shifting from Oil to Coal The Sharif government\u2019s decision to switch from oil to coal was problematic. Some 70% of all the CPEC power plant projects are coal-based. Coal usage is projected to rise from five million tonnes in 2015 to 15 million in 2020, and imports will also rise. Pakistan\u2019s commitment to reduce greenhouse gases under the Paris Agreement will be difficult to achieve. This coal focus contrasts with China\u2019s newly proclaimed sustainability policy at home. China continues to be involved in coal power plants in its neighbourhood. Most CPEC power plants are based on the Chinese BOOT \u201cbuild, own, operate, transfer\u201d model. Chinese ownership will be transferred to the Government of Pakistan after 30 years of operation. This raises transparency and accountability questions. Following recent electricity price hikes, a government committee, set up in August 2019, reviewed the role of Independent Power Producers (IPP). It recently found serious \u201cmalpractices\u201d by IPPs like inflated operating costs and high annual profits. Pressure is mounting on Pakistan\u2019s PM Khan by the newly founded opposition \u201cPakistan Democratic Movement\u201d to ensure efficacy of CPEC projects. For years, Baluchistan separatists and insurgents have been fighting the government. CPEC projects have become targets and are increasingly unpopular among the Baluchistan population. The Pakistani Army launched major security operations but seems to have been rather heavy-handed in its approach. Alleged extrajudicial arrests by the military have resulted in a loss of confidence in the government. Five years after the start of CPEC, Pakistanis demand greater transparency and accountability. It is in the mutual interests of both governments to ensure that tangible benefits reach the Pakistani population soon and that greater transparency is achieved. Pakistan\u2019s fiscal and economic woes, compounded by the effects of the pandemic, do not leave much room for manoeuvre."

    "title": "Biden\u2019s Corporate Dilemma: The Political Dimension",
    "author(s)": "By Adam Garfinkle",
    "date": "No. 116 \u2013 30 July 2021",
    "content": "ON FRIDAY 9 July 2021, President Joe Biden announced a major Executive Order (EO) on Promoting Competition in the American Economy. Speaking in the White House with the director of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the acting assistant secretary of Justice for Antitrust silent at his side, Biden proclaimed: \u201cThe heart of American capitalism is a simple idea: open and fair competition\u2026 Competition keeps the economy moving and keeps it growing. Fair competition is why capitalism has been the world\u2019s greatest force for prosperity and growth.\u201d He later added by way of careful counterpoint that capitalism without fair competition is \u201cexploitation\u201d. Connecting the Dots Rumours of a forthcoming EO had circulated in June, but the broad scope and girth of the result took most observers of US domestic policy unawares. The EO took on anti- competitive market distortions in big-tech, healthcare and health insurance, agriculture, telecommunications, transportation, and more. It included 72 separate initiatives spelled out by more than 6,300 words, accompanied a White House Fact Sheet in excess of 3,800 words. Partly as a result of the EO\u2019s scope and complexity, and its summertime Friday rollout, media coverage of the announcement was sparse. Even the predictable criticism from corporate lobbyists was notably unimaginative, failing even to take the full measure of the challenge to business-as-usual the EO really portends. But the 9 July EO is far too important to remain a victim of the media\u2019s attention deficit disorder. True, major parts of it are less than meets the eye, as is typical of what was a political performance as a well as a policy pronouncement. Some plaints are just for show, and many of the EO\u2019s desiderata are not the president\u2019s alone to bring about: For some he needs independent agencies to concur and for others he needs Congress. But other aspects of the EO presage much more than meets the eye, notably its implications for the entire domain of antitrust regulation going forward. To properly understand what happened on 9 July requires connecting the dots between America\u2019s fraught contemporary politics, which requires President Biden to juggle optics left and right as he looks toward elections next year and in 2024, and a recent shift in the intellectual evolution of legal thought concerning antitrust regulation. Growing Anti-Corporate Left-Wing First things first. As to the politics, Biden has within his own party a growing left-wing that is generically anti-corporate, anti-big tech to the point of being para-Luddite, and is at its further extremes avowedly anti-capitalist. With the Senate evenly divided and the Democrats with but a slim four-seat majority in the House. Biden must keep this wing of the party content enough to ensure its support for his major legislative initiatives. This is because, having so far spurned in all but the case of the recently passed infrastructure bill a \u201ctriangulation\u201d deal with the rump of sane Senate Republicans, he needs perfect party unity to achieve anything in Congress. Besides, anti-corporate rhetoric plays well to an electorally significant populist Left, particularly among younger voters who are, whether they realise it or not, the inheritors of the Occupy Wall Street movement. On the other hand, right-wing populism has also grown increasingly anti-big corporation in timbre, giving the Democrats a chance to recoup support from the corporate world at Republican expense if they can stake out a credible claim to the political centre. That is a tricky proposition when, at the same time, the main thrust of Democratic to disaffected blue-collar workers \u2500 a.k.a. somewhat is political outreach disingenuously termed \u201cthe middle class\u201d. But both can be done so long as the optic of the corporate critique is impassionedly based on facts about the impact of corporate consolidation on wages and jobs in a post-industrial economy, and lacks sanctimonious \u201ceat the rich\u201d rhetorical threats to tax corporations and wealthy individuals as moralistic punishment for their successes, which the left defines solely as \u201cexploitation\u201d. Fumbling the Juggling Lately, Biden has fumbled trying to keep his juggling balls aloft. The pro-capitalism language of the 9 July EO was perfect \u2500 kudos to the speechwriter. But somehow the desired spin on the event failed to take in the media. Most headlines next day transformed the positive connotation of the EO\u2019s title about promoting competition into the negative tense: Saturday\u2019s Washington Post front-page headline read \u201cBiden targets corporate power\u201d. The same spin caromed abroad, even into the Straits Times\u2019 brief story, probably taking its cue from a Reuters dispatch. Worse, soon afterwards Biden got into a public shouting match with Facebook about anti-vaccination memes on social media. Facebook did not back down. How that has played politically is open to interpretation, but Biden\u2019s tone came across as petulant. Worse still, media coverage of the administration\u2019s plans to spend US$3.5 trillion over and above the stimulus and infrastructure bills \u2500 the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Budget puts the real price tag nearer to $5.5 trillion \u2500 is regularly accompanied by a statement that Biden plans to pay for all this by sharply raising taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals. The recent US-supported framework agreement on a Minimum Corporate Tax signed by 130 countries is taken to be a part of the broader effort, and most US corporations don\u2019t like it one bit. Finding a Better Balance Biden has at times beclouded the presumed determination to raise corporate taxes; like any experienced politician knows how to do, he has fudged his intentions with clouds of temporising ambiguity. But at the same time he has allowed administration spokesmen and congressional allies to pre-justify a tax hike by pointing out that the current corporate tax rate is historically far lower than it was, say, during the Republican Eisenhower and Nixon- Ford administrations. If Biden avoids significantly raising taxes to pay for his \u201cgo big\u201d spending plans, which in political terms means doing more than simply reversing the effects of the Trump tax cut, the only other ways available to pay for them risk politically untimely inflation or recession. Business constituencies won't like either one, and neither will many voters. The president cannot allow a major EO to be characterised as \u201ctargeting corporate power\u201d, and use his bully pulpit to accuse Big Tech of harming public health via social media, and be seen to favour raising corporate taxes couched as a moral imperative, and still stand a chance of wooing corporate support for the Democrats. He needs to refine his juggling act and find his balance, or too many balls will hit the floor. At this parlous moment in American politics, the stakes could hardly be higher."

    "title": "Arrest of 53 Activists: Hong Kong's Tightening Grip",
    "author(s)": "By Dylan MH Loh",
    "date": "No. 004 \u2013 7 January 2021",
    "content": "SIX DAYS into the new year, on 6 January 2021, 53 political activists in Hong Kong were arrested for allegedly violating the national security laws as they were involved in an unofficial \u2018primary election\u2019 in Hong Kong in 2020. This was viewed as potential subversion by the authorities. The incoming United States Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, condemned the arrests as \u201can assault on those bravely advocating for universal rights\u201d. Nevertheless, Washington seems to have exhausted its options on Hong Kong and cannot offer any good response with serious bite. What is the significance of the arrests of the 53 political activists? Primaries in 2020: \u201835+ Strategy\u2019 Unofficial primaries were held in Hong Kong in July 2020 with the goal of selecting the most viable pro-democracy candidates for the Legislative Council elections \u2013 to realise the so-called \u201835+ strategy\u2019. The strategy\u2019s purpose, largely the brainchild of Benny Tai, the Hong Kong legal scholar and democracy activist, was to maximise the chances for an outright majority of democratic lawmakers in Hong Kong\u2019s 70-member legislative council. It is worth bearing in mind that half of these seats are reserved for \u2018functional constituencies\u2019 representing special interest groups such as \u2018financial services\u2019 and \u2018tourism\u2019. Significantly, largely pro-establishment to be representatives and as such only 35 seats are directly contestable through elections. filled by these tend Conducting the unofficial primaries has a couple of distinct advantages for the pro- democratic camp. First, it prevents a cannibalisation of votes as candidates are bound by a gentlemen\u2019s agreement not to contest in the Legislative Council, if they were not the winning candidates. Second, the primaries demonstrated that, despite their ideological differences, different pro-democratic candidates were willing to work together to achieve broader political goals. The turnout for the primaries was relatively high, with over 600,000 Hong Kong residents voting, accounting for around 13% of the total registered voters. In response, Chinese state media \u2013 the Global Times \u2013 warned that the conduct of the primaries is likely to fall afoul of Hong Kong\u2019s national security law. \u201c10 Steps to Mutual Destruction\u201d There are at least four pertinent reasons for the arrests. Firstly, and perhaps most importantly, Benny Tai\u2019s \u201835+ strategy\u2019 secures an agreement from the candidates to leverage their majoritarian position to veto Hong Kong\u2019s budget. This gets to the heart of the arrests because the Legislative Council is tasked with passing the budget. In the event that the Legislative Council does not pass the budget, the Chief Executive must resign. That is the end-goal of the \u201935+ strategy\u2019 \u2013 to take down Carrie Lam. Under the national security laws, however, this falls under the \u2018subverting the state power\u2019 category and in the eyes of the authorities, seems to fulfil the criteria of \u201cseriously interfering in, disrupting, or undermining the performance of duties and functions\u201d of the Hong Kong and Central governments. Secondly, and perhaps more incendiary from the Hong Kong and Chinese governments\u2019 perspective, is the \u201910 steps to mutual destruction\u2019 plan. In this proposal, Benny Tai outlined a progressive series of escalatory steps for political activists to take up to ensure the removal of the current government. The proposed steps culminate in a large street protest \u201cleading Hong Kong society to a standstill\u201d and eventually, in the tenth step, causing world powers to enact economic and political sanctions on the Chinese Communist Party. Upcoming Sept 2021 Legislative Elections The other key motivating factor is the upcoming 2021 September Legislative Elections. By arresting and potentially disbarring these candidates in the upcoming elections, the authorities can essentially eviscerate the pro-democratic movement and their electoral chances in one fell swoop as every candidate that ran in the 2020 primaries were arrested. It is also apt to note that the security laws carry a maximum of life imprisonment for \u2018principal\u2019 offenders. Thirdly, the opportunity is ripe because the United States have almost exhausted all their possible foreign policy options over Hong Kong. The US has already sanctioned Chinese and Hong Kong officials \u2013 resulting in Carrie Lam\u2019s inability to use credit cards \u2013 over purported human rights abuses in Hong Kong and there is not much more they can do in that regard. In that way, beyond verbal opprobrium, there is little else the US and other Western countries can or are willing to do. Finally, the arrests and the series of arrests leading up to 6 January send a strong domestic signal that the Central government is firmly in charge. It would not have escaped observers that President Xi Jinping\u2019s annual new year greetings struck an almost triumphalist tone. This is understandable given China\u2019s relative success in containing COVID-19 as compared to its western counterparts. Nevertheless, the political leadership in Beijing is delivering on its promise to bring stability and security to Hong Kong through these highly visible securitising activities which demonstrate effective control over the island. What Next? The legislative election due in Hong Kong is months away but this was originally scheduled to be held in September 2020. It was postponed by the Hong Kong government when it invoked emergency laws due to the worsening coronavirus situation. In any event, the latest arrests coupled with an increasingly propensity to wield the powerful national security laws will deal a heavy a blow to the electoral chances of the pro-democrats. There are two other developments that bear watching. The first is the normalisation of the national security law and the seemingly frequent exercise of the powers therein. Normally, such laws in other jurisdictions are only invoked in exceptional cases. Regularly wielding these powers may have the effect of wearing down resistance, turning it into quiet acceptance. The second is how the pro-democratic camp reacts to this. Will this stifle the movement that was already under heavy pressure or will this galvanise them to adopt more extreme measures? In any event, the latest arrests portend a period of stronger, more visible and indeed more decisive control from the Central authorities in Hong Kong\u2019s political and social spheres."

    "title": "Global Health Security COVID-19 & Its Impacts Battling Marine Plastic Waste: Nuclear Technology's Role",
    "author(s)": "By Julius Cesar Trajano",
    "date": "No. 019 \u2013 3 February 2021",
    "content": "PLASTIC WASTE from mismanaged disposal of single-use face masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment (PPE) used during COVID-19 has ended up choking our oceans. Its complex consequences may last even beyond this pandemic. The worsening plastic pollution in our oceans is a critical area where nuclear technology can play an important role and provide innovative alternative solutions to conventional approaches. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) launched in 2020 a new initiative, the NUclear TEchnology for Controlling Plastic Pollution\u2019 (NUTEC Plastic), which intends to explore and rapidly expand the use of nuclear technology to fight plastic pollution in the oceans and reduce plastic waste globally. COVID-19 & Deteriorating Oceans Even before the pandemic, marine plastic pollution was already posing an existential threat to marine wildlife, ecosystems, food safety and human health globally. Marine pollution is an issue of global concern, in particular for countries in Southeast Asia that rely on fisheries as a source of food and income. Every year about 8-12 million metric tonnes of plastic debris find their way into the oceans, including microplastics. With the COVID-19 pandemic, plastic pollution has even been exacerbated. A report by marine conservation organisation OceansAsia estimated that 1.56 billion face masks had entered the oceans in 2020. This has resulted in an additional 4,680 to 6,240 metric tonnes of marine plastic debris. It will take 450 years for these face masks to degrade, gradually disintegrating into more hazardous microplastics while endangering marine wildlife. In the region, five Southeast Asian countries, namely Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam have been listed as among world\u2019s top 10 contributors of mismanaged plastic waste. Collectively, they generate 8.9 million metric tonnes of mismanaged plastic waste annually. Turning Plastic Waste into Economic Value? How can nuclear technology help address marine plastic pollution? Many studies have documented the impact of large plastic debris on the marine environment. However, further studies are needed to provide reliable and accurate assessment of the potential damage caused by microplastics which can be ingested by marine animals, including fish. Together with the toxic chemicals that have accumulated on microplastics, they can be transferred through the food chain and be ingested by humans through the consumption of seafood. This has been identified as a health hazard but has not yet been adequately researched. The major challenge for scientists and policymakers in dealing with ocean plastic pollution is a lack of knowledge on the exact concentration of microplastics in the oceans and the marine food chain. Nuclear techniques can play a critical role as they are already successfully deployed to examine marine pollution processes. Specifically, radioactive tracer techniques can help scientists understand how microplastics get contaminated by toxic pollutants and how they transfer such pollutants to marine organisms and to the food chain. Such techniques were recently successfully done in Ecuador, revealing that microplastic pollution in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean will worsen in the coming decades. Precise and timely information on the movement, amount and impact of microplastics can help strengthen marine pollution monitoring programmes, environmental management strategies, and seafood safety regulations. Another area where nuclear technology can make an impact is in the recycling and reduction of plastic waste. When conventional methods of recycling of plastic waste are no longer possible, radiation technologies can be used to recycle plastic waste into new commercially viable plastic items, thus generating economic benefits while reducing waste volumes. While this is a promising technique based on recent scientific studies, it has yet to be seen whether countries can successfully integrate this technique into their sustainable approach to plastic waste. Southeast Asia: What Can Be Done Southeast Asian countries should step up to explore the peaceful applications of nuclear technology. These include environmental management. It is thus timely that Indonesia and the Philippines have both expressed their strong commitment to support and participate in the recently launched NUTEC Plastic initiative of the IAEA. Both have decades of experience in civilian uses of nuclear technology and vowed to address their worsening plastic waste problem. In recent years, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam have developed or are developing their national action plans to curb marine plastic pollution. The integration of the NUTEC Plastic project with their plastic waste control programmes will certainly enhance their respective action plans which all promote the deployment of innovative scientific solutions. Similarly, utilising nuclear technology can definitely advance the 2019 ASEAN Framework of Action on Marine Debris, which encourages ASEAN member-states to promote and enhance \"science-based decisions and policies on marine debris prevention and management\u201d. The region has a growing pool of local nuclear scientists who can collaborate with other relevant environmental scientists and policymakers to develop and apply technologies for plastic waste control. Plastic pollution is a problem as big as the ocean; hence, support and contribution from different stakeholders are critical in tackling marine plastic pollution. The region\u2019s nuclear technology research and training centres should therefore be part of the multi- stakeholder collaboration which is critical in searching for innovative scientific solutions. Way Forward: A Sustainable Approach The ASEAN-IAEA Practical Arrangements on the peaceful uses of nuclear technology, signed in 2019, would be a useful framework for knowledge and technology transfer to Southeast Asian nations. They can equally be the foundation for the two organisations to explore the potential of nuclear technology application in curbing marine litter in the region. As ASEAN member-states pledge to collectively address marine pollution, they should maximise the growing regional cooperation in nuclear safety, security and technology spearheaded by the ASEAN Network of Regulatory Bodies on Atomic Energy (ASEANTOM). In view of the existential threats posed by marine plastic pollution, it is imperative that countries in the region explore all effective ways to curb and reverse the negative impacts of plastic waste on the marine environment and ecosystem in regional seas. Building on the success of existing ASEAN cooperation in nuclear technology may have the potential to enhance the region\u2019s environmental security with safe, secure and peaceful uses of nuclear technology."

    "title": "Air Force Modernisation: Indonesia\u2019s Troubled Acquisition",
    "author(s)": "By Olli Pekka Suorsa",
    "date": "No. 048 \u2013 18 March 2021",
    "content": "WITH THE largest archipelago in the world, stretching over 1.9 million square kilometres, the Indonesian Air Force (TNI-AU) faces a huge operational burden. It currently operates 72 combat aircraft in five squadrons. However, only 45 percent of the equipment is considered operational. The TNI-AU\u2019s primary combat aircraft, the F-16, Hawk, and Su-27/-30, come in six different variants and from three different manufacturers. Coupled with small quantities, different types and versions makes maintenance, repair, and overhaul a daunting task. Besides problems with separate spares and logistical chains, interoperability amongst the types is virtually non-existent. Instead, each type forms separate \u2018silos\u2019 of capability. Troubled Acquisition The Minimum Essential Force (MEF2024) plan to modernise the air force by 2024 was meant to address TNI\u2019s capability and capacity shortfalls and to create a modern force with a strong deterrent. Materialisation, however, has been slow and often insufficient. TNI-AU has struggled to replace its ageing aircraft, reaching only 45 percent of the MEF requirement. Indonesia\u2019s air force modernisation and fleet recapitalisation has been marred with multiple challenges, including lack of funding, lack of government commitment, as well as inefficient and highly-personalised acquisition policy. The preceding five-year acquisition plan saw a long-sought after deal with Russia finalised for a delivery of 11 Su-35 Flanker-Es. The acquisition was well in line with Indonesia\u2019s tradition to buy both western and Russian equipment. However, the deal has since fallen victim to the US\u2019 Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), putting pressure on Jakarta to cancel the deal with Moscow. Under the 2nd Jokowi government, its politically ambitious Defence Minister Prabowo Subianto has since personalised the acquisition policy. His ambition to acquire the 5th generation F-35 Lightning II was rejected outright by Washington in October 2020. Instead, the US offered Indonesia less advanced but much more affordable F-16 Block 70/72 and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. In response to the rejected F-35 request and the troubled Su-35 deal, Prabowo has sought alternatives from elsewhere, including from France for the Rafale. Surprisingly, Prabowo approached Austria for their much- criticised Typhoon Tranche 1 jets, despite the ministry of defence\u2019s decision not to buy second-hand aircraft. Following several twists and turns in the fighter procurement saga it seems that Indonesia has finally settled on two front-runners, the Rafale and the F-15EX, as the \u2018second best\u2019 choice. The announcement to procure 36 Rafale and an initial 8 F-15EX fall under the Third Phase of the MEF, covering 2020-2024, with first F-15EX projected to arrive by 2022. Costs of Modern Combat Aircraft The aggressive procurement schedule caught many by surprise. It typically takes several years from the signing of contract to the delivery of the first aircraft. Therefore, it is unlikely that Indonesia would receive new aircraft by 2022 as suggested. Not least because the F-15EX first took into air only in February 2021, with the first aircraft delivered to the USAF in March. Another issue is the procurement cost. Based on several existing users, the Rafale and the \u2018advanced Eagle\u2019 have come at a unit price of US$243-US$290 million and $333-$350 million, respectively, including training for pilots and maintainers, a weapons package, support and sustainment contracts, and associated facilities and equipment. Indonesia\u2019s potential procurement of the two aircraft, then, would cost between $11.4 and 13.2 billion. Spread over the five-year acquisition period, it would consume 66-70 percent of the annual budget allocated for defence modernization in the 2021 budget figures. This will likely prove to be beyond Jakarta\u2019s capacity without a significant additional commitment or substantially longer induction period. In addition, operating modern combat aircraft is costly. The Rafale and F-15EX cost $16,000 and $27,000 per flight-hour. In comparison, F-16, the most numerous fighter in the TNI-AU service, costs two or three times less to operate. The higher operating costs would translate into significantly higher through-life costs for the two types. Procurement Rationality Indonesia\u2019s interest in two broadly comparable combat aircraft raises questions about the plan\u2019s rationality. First, the two aircraft would further complicate TNI-AU\u2019s already troubled support and maintenance system further by creating two additional supply and logistics chains. And second, there is little interoperability amongst the different types. Indonesia, however, does not wish to rely on any one combat aircraft type or OEM alone. The memory of the US\u2019 sanctions which rendered the then-new F-16 fleet practically inoperable is still fresh. Therefore, Indonesia has sought to diversify its fleet to avoid a similar fate again. This is also the likely rationale behind the plan to procure both types. Furthermore, should Indonesia purchase the F-15EX, it would be based on the Saudi and Qatari variants (the F-15SA and -QA), not the US version. The F-15EX integrates certain export-restricted systems like the advanced electronic warfare suite, which would not be available for Indonesia. The same is likely the case with some of the most advanced weapons available for the type. In contrast, the Rafale will offer more independent capability for Indonesia with little restrictions on the export of the most advanced equipment and weapons, including the advanced Meteor air-to-air missile, the Exocet anti-ship missile, and the SCALP-EG cruise missile. Moreover, besides diversification rationale, the potential procurement of both types has also a likely political reasoning. The procurement of the F-15EX could provide improved access to Washington and future acquisitions whereas the Rafale delivers unrestricted and, thus, superior capability for the TNI-AU. Avoiding Past Mistakes: Need for Clear Priorities The TNI-AU should adopt a clear acquisition plan with a strong political and financial commitment to avoid the past mistakes of procuring a handful of combat aircraft from multiple vendors and in several versions. Moreover, the air force should ensure that any future combat aircraft should come fully equipped and with a required support. In addition, the service should prioritise replacing older types before expanding the force too ambitiously. Critically, the TNI-AU should urgently address the separate \u2018silos\u2019 problem by investing in third-party solutions to network the existing and future capabilities. Finally, the TNI-AU should create a force structure that fits its mission needs and one it can afford. A force mix between new and upgraded F-16s and Rafale and/or F-15EX would offer the most cost-effective means to fulfil the TNI-AU\u2019s operational requirements in the coming decades."

    "title": "Guarding Against Foreign Interference in Elections",
    "author(s)": "By Stephanie Neubronner",
    "date": "No. 045 \u2013 20 March 2020",
    "content": "THE RELEASE of the Electoral Boundaries Review Report on 13 March 2020 suggests that Singapore\u2019s next general election is just around the corner. With various political parties already gearing up for the next election, it is crucial that Singapore does not lose sight of the importance of protecting itself from foreign interference. Foreign interference is not a new threat jeopardising the security, unity and autonomy of states. Throughout history, nations have attempted to interfere in other states\u2019 politics for their own benefit for a multitude of reasons. While the basis of foreign state motivations might not have changed much, the use of technology to amplify and markedly increase the reach and concealment of such interference has raised concerns for governments around the world. Threat of Foreign Interference Increasingly, Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) are being used to target social fault lines and trust in public institutions. With the intention of mobilising people against something rather than for something, such Hostile Information Campaigns (HICs) are often directed at intangible targets with economic, political and social impact. Such coordinated attempts are also usually covert and aim to sow confusion, fray civic threads, and intensify existing polarisations. A proactive approach against the threat of foreign interference in Singapore\u2019s domestic politics is thus imperative. This is particularly important as Singapore\u2019s openness, interconnectivity, as well as its multiracial and multi-religious composition make it particularly vulnerable. The 2016 United States presidential election is a recent example of the threat foreign interference poses. The Mueller Report indicated that a major foreign power that has been locked in ideological competition with the US utilised ICTs as part of a larger planned operation to create dissonance within the US political system. Social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook were targeted, and by the end of the presidential election, the major foreign power had the ability to reach at least 29 million US individuals through their social media accounts. The major foreign power was also in control of social media accounts that had hundreds of thousands of US participants, including media outlets, high-profile persons and US political figures who reposted or responded to the content it created. Threat Facing Singapore Singapore has been the target of cyber attacks and HICs in the past, and it continues to be so today. Two examples stand out, highlighting the ongoing threat Singapore faces: First, the 2013 Anonymous cyber attack affecting the incumbent\u2019s webpage and leak of government employees\u2019 personal information; second, the unprecedented attack on SingHealth\u2019s national health database in June 2018, where personal information of 1.5 million individuals, including that of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong were illegally accessed. These threats cannot be taken lightly given the increased threat foreign interference in domestic politics poses, especially when paired with the repercussions of deliberate online falsehoods. In November 2018, an online news article falsely linking Prime Minister Lee to the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) scandal was published and circulated online. The article purported that Malaysia had signed several unfair agreements with Singapore in exchange for Singapore banks\u2019 assistance in laundering 1MDB\u2019s funds. The article also suggested that Singapore was reluctant to investigate the 1MDB scandal, only reopening its investigations after it was forced to do so. Not Insignificant Such forms of misinformation may appear relatively insignificant, but could actually cause serious damage to Singapore\u2019s credibility and interests if not corrected. Additionally, such misinformation could potentially undermine public trust in government institutions, alter social behaviours and cause rifts within Singapore\u2019s multiracial society. Technology\u2019s role in creating greater strains on individuals\u2019 trust in democracy, institutions, values and social systems cannot be overlooked. Should a culture of distrust and discontent erupt, preserving social cohesion and national security in Singapore will become even more arduous. Preventing the interference of HICs in Singapore\u2019s domestic politics will likewise become exceptionally challenging. Learning From Others\u2019 Experiences Standing out from the long list of recent episodes of electoral interference overseas is the coordinated attempt to undermine Emmanuel Macron\u2019s candidacy in the 2017 French presidential election. The attempt failed to influence French politics as conscious efforts were made to prepare the country for the likelihood that electoral meddling would occur. Having taken heed of the incidents during the 2016 US presidential election, provisions guaranteeing the integrity of the French electoral process were implemented. This included technical training for all campaign officials, equipping them with the necessary skills to monitor, identify and deal with suspicious activity in candidates\u2019 information systems. The speed with which Macron\u2019s team responded to the HIC is a testament to the value of planning for the eventuality of a HIC. There was also growing public awareness of the impact disinformation and HICs have. This further contributed to the French people and media viewing the leaked documents with suspicion, which helped weaken its influence. Similarly, Canada has benefited from learning from the US\u2019 experience with foreign election meddling. The extent of measures implemented in the run up to its recently concluded election should also be viewed as a forewarning of the pervasiveness and seriousness the threat foreign interference poses. Implications Having planned a coordinated response to foreign interference attempts, Canada\u2019s reaction enabled it to successfully fend off online disinformation, cyberattacks and other foreign interference during its 2019 federal election. Several measures were put in place. First, legislation to combat foreign funding and the spread of fake statements aimed at influencing election outcomes. Second, the enhancement of citizen preparedness through the setting up of the Critical Election Incident Public Protocol, which informs citizens of incidents that threaten Canada\u2019s ability to have a free and fair election. Third, improvements in the coordination between Canada\u2019s government and security agencies via the establishment of the Security and Intelligence Threats to Elections Task Force; and fourth, requiring social media platforms to increase the transparency, authenticity and integrity of their systems. As Singapore gears towards its own hustings, what can we learn from these overseas cases? One, introduce new, more targeted laws enabling investigators to prevent and examine threats; two, update existing legislation to account for new methods of interference particularly in the cyber domain; three, generate more awareness amongst Singaporeans about the country\u2019s multiracial makeup and vulnerabilities, and how Singapore\u2019s different communities coexist harmoniously. These are some ways Singapore could adopt in its own strategy against the threat of foreign interference. With other countries already implementing measures to deal with HICs and foreign interference, Singapore should take a proactive approach in safeguarding its national security, social cohesion and sovereignty. Waiting for more serious cases of foreign interference to occur before taking action will only prove to be foolish."

    "title": "Global Health Security: COVID-19 & Its Impacts Disinformation: The Spreading of Islamophobia",
    "author(s)": "By Remy Mahzam",
    "date": "No. 091 \u2013 13 May 2020",
    "content": "HARD-LINE right-wing groups in parts of Asia and the West are preying on people\u2019s fears and vulnerabilities amidst the ongoing global pandemic to push a slew of conspiracy theories and disinformation aimed at vilifying Muslims. In countries such as India, the United Kingdom and the United States, various far-right movements, are turning to a familiar playbook \u0336  by peddling Islamophobic hate speech through unsubstantiated conspiracy theories, memes and fake videos online. For example, perpetrators of anti-Muslim propaganda (some of whom enjoy state patronage), have made up statistics about virus infections and falsely accuse some Muslims of deliberately spreading the virus as well as flouting lockdown rules. Islamophobia: Not a New Issue While not a new issue, studies show that levels of Islamophobia increase around certain events. Researchers in the UK, for example, have observed that the ongoing Ramadan month seems to have instigated a fresh wave of conspiracy theories online around Muslims, with false claims that the virus is likely to spread around this time. Several experts have also recently cautioned that given many people are currently cooped up at home with social distancing rules, some could be vulnerable to the influx of fake news and conspiracy theories online, which mostly go unchallenged. The problem with such disinformation is it can lead to wider retribution against Muslims and, possibly by extension, other minority communities, when lockdowns are eventually lifted. Around the world, aggressive efforts have gone into curtailing the proliferation of \u2018infodemics\u2019, a term coined by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to reference the proliferation of false information on COVID-19, both online and offline. Similar initiatives are needed to inoculate against the spread of hateful speech directed at racial and religious minorities. Otherwise, festering grievances may again be exploited by radical groups, including Islamist terrorist networks, who traditionally ramp up their propaganda and recruitment efforts during Ramadan, to sow discord. \u2018Corona Jihad\u2019 and the Exploitation of Fissures In recent months, hard-right extremists in India have scapegoated the country\u2019s Muslim population by claiming they are deliberately spreading the coronavirus through \u201ccorona-jihad\u201d. On various online channels, such Islamophobic hashtags and memes began popping up soon after the outbreak. A study by Equality Labs, a South Asian digital human rights group, revealed the \u201ccorona-jihad\u201d hashtag was used around 300,000 times between 29 March and 3 April 2020, and viewed by as many as 165 million people. Other prominent hashtags such as #BioJihad, #Coronaterrorism, #MuslimsSpreadingCorona, which were translated into local languages, also gained online traction. Analysis by Voyager Infosec further revealed more than 30,000 videos were circulated on social media platform TikTok, as part of a targeted disinformation campaign aimed at misleading Muslims in India into flouting safe distancing conditions and avoid mask wearing. Content portraying Muslims as the allegedly key purveyors of the COVID-19 virus, was also prevalent on other social media platforms such as Facebook, Telegram and WhatsApp. With coronavirus infections surging across the country in recent weeks, the rising hostility toward India\u2019s 200 million Muslims threatens to inflame longstanding religious tensions in the Hindu-majority nation. Earlier this year, divisions had already begun to harden when the government passed a citizenship bill that discriminated against Muslims, sparking nationwide protests that have left scores dead. The spread of COVID-19-related hate speech has further exacerbated these divisions, and also contributed to an upsurge in anti-Muslim hate crimes in recent weeks. Attacks on Muslims, including farmers driven out of villagers and others beaten by angry mobs, have been reported across the country. Analysts say such attacks could spike both during Ramadan and after the lockdowns are lifted. Islamophobia in the West In the UK, law enforcement agencies have warned that dozens of far-right groups are attempting to weaponise COVID-19 to instigate anti-Muslim attacks. For example, far- right activists have taken to circulating old videos and images of British Muslims praying in mosques in an attempt to portray them as violating social distancing rules during the ongoing nationwide lockdown. Muslim advocacy groups and the police have since come out to debunk these claims. Similarly, far-right hate groups in the US have taken to spreading false conspiracy theories, including a claim that churches in the country were forced to close during the pandemic while mosques remained open for worship. US President Donald Trump was recently also accused of stoking Islamophobia, after claiming the authorities may enforce social distancing rules in mosques during Ramadan differently, compared to how churchgoers were treated during the recent Easter celebrations. Media reporting has also contributed, in part, to the spread of hate sentiments. In India, the mainstream media outlet India Today, for example, released a news report titled \u201cMadrasas Hotspots\u201d, which inaccurately accused some madrasas (Islamic schools) of violating the country\u2019s lockdown rules. The \u00d6sterreich OE24, an Austrian daily, also drew ire recently for using the image of a hijab-wearing woman in an online news report of a suspected coronavirus case involving a Chinese stewardess. Fighting the Virus and Disinformation Together COVID-19 has featured prominently in both far-right and Islamist militant groups\u2019 propaganda messaging since the outbreak started. For IS, the month of Ramadan has become a strategic time in which to launch attacks. IS will look to exploit the COVID- 19-related grievances of vulnerable Muslims to sow discord, recruit into its ranks and call for fresh attacks. To counter the harmful spread of COVID-19-related hate sentiments, social media companies will have to work closely with health authorities to establish security firewalls against disinformation campaigns both during and after the current pandemic. This includes removing false claims and Islamophobic conspiracy theories that have been flagged by global health agencies as hate propaganda. Religious actors also have significant roles to play, particularly in providing guidance and promoting solidarity, for vulnerable communities. tolerance and resilience interfaith They have an important role in guiding their congregations to discern rumours, distortions and myths about other religious groups. In times of crisis, faith institutions are also uniquely positioned to identify vulnerable individuals in their communities, and quickly mobilise the necessary support."

    "title": "US Presidential Election 2020 An Election Doomed to Cause Harm?",
    "author(s)": "By Adam Garfinkle",
    "date": "No. 170 \u2013 14 September 2020",
    "content": "MYRIAD UNCERTAINTIES pervade the upcoming 3 November 2020 presidential election in the United States. Aside from not knowing who will win the presidency and how Congress will balance out, prior anxieties attend the integrity of the voting process itself. That integrity is assaulted from three separate sources, which combine to produce an unprecedented circumstance. The first of these is the threat of foreign interference in the electoral process. Russian intelligence was engaged in such manipulation in the November 2016 election, and today evidence proffered in congressional testimony by the US intelligence community suggests that Chinese and Iranian government agents are involved, as well. These efforts do not seek mainly to distort vote counts in electronic tabulations, but rather to skew debate before the vote by fabricating \u201copinion\u201d through bots massively inserting fake views into the public domain. Voting Integrity and the Rogue Factor At least one authority, air force general and former director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper, argued in his 2018 book Facts and Fears, that Russian efforts in 2016 may have tipped the presidential election to Donald Trump. More recently, Democratic vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris suggested that Russian efforts again might make the difference. The second fly in the electoral ointment is the massive disruption of normal, well- practised, if nevertheless imperfect, voting protocols because of COVID-19. One major new concern is that polling stations are being consolidated in many localities to limit possible pandemic super-spreader incidents. The worry is that this will cause long lines where many wary people will come into proximity with those who may not wear masks or adhere to social distancing precautions. Such fears may suppress voting more in minority neighbourhoods, thus disproportionately affecting Democratic totals. Worse, the politicisation of a large anticipated increase in mail-in ballots on account of COVID-19 fears \u2013 and the feared infirmity of both the United States Postal Service and local governments to do anything new right, even in the absence of partisan chicanery \u2013 has introduced a huge rogue factor in the integrity of the final count. Crux of the Problem Unprecedented counting delays of so many mailed-in ballots will also likely create phased results: polling-place results coming in first and mail-in and absentee ballots being counted later. The possibility of fraud over the latter is not high, but the likelihood of politically incendiary claims of fraud is very high indeed. Neither side trusts anyone to be an honest, objective arbiter of disputes that could arise over mailed-in ballots; herein lies the real crux of the problem: Republicans don\u2019t trust Democrats on principle. Democrats don\u2019t trust Republicans, in part because they have sought to selectively suppress voter turnout in many ways over recent years. The latest permutation of that tack is the president\u2019s threat to send sheriffs and other law-enforcement personnel to polling places, obviously to intimidate groups whose general experience with police has not been a happy one. Clearly, the president\u2019s openly admitted desire to garrote the USPS to suppress \u201cundesirable\u201d votes \u2013 despite the fact that the president himself also votes by mail \u2013 has inflamed the situation. It, and the reaction against it by Congressional Democrats, have primed and pre-legitimated various parties to object peremptorily to any results they don\u2019t like, including demands that voting stop so as to invalidate late-counted mail-in ballots. Thus, polarised, partisan \u201ccommunications\u201d teams now stand ready to flood social media \u2013 now by far the source of most Americans\u2019 \u201cnews\u201d \u2013 with misrepresentations and lurid conspiracy theories about the vote count. Legal teams, too, are already assembled to seize any opportunity to muddy the waters in their eventual favour. New Factor Again, this is not entirely new, as the \u201changing chads\u201d debacle in Florida during the Bush-Gore 2000 election reminds us. But the present technological environment is new: In November 2000 Internet-enabled iPhones did not yet exist, so neither did significant Russian opportunities to weaponise social media. The third factor is new: Never before has an incumbent president pre-judged any electoral result that does not see him returned to office as fraudulent. During the 2016 campaign Trump introduced and often repeated this claim at campaign rallies. In 2020 he at one point assured the nation that he would step down voluntarily if he were to lose, only to reverse course to the 2016 meme \u2013 again claiming that any loss would be evidence of \u201cdeep state\u201d fraud. This, more than anything else, has provided the energy for the widespread fear that democratic norms will be seriously damaged in November; in other words, no matter who wins, the nation\u2019s democratic health and heritage will lose. The fact that Kamala Harris has postulated Russian manipulations may determine the outcome in November \u2013 which is bound to be seen as a basis for future complaint and demand \u2013 is a lesser sin in this context, but a sin all the same. It was foolish to boot, because it provides Republicans with the raw material to claim, \u201cwell, the Democrats say that, too\u201d. Three Assaults: Crossing the Streams These three assaults on the integrity of the upcoming balloting have combined to produce fears of varying shapes and sizes. Many scenarios have been created, some public and some not. Some scenarios are realistic and thus useful as shields against otherwise unexpected crisis. For example, unless there is a landslide for one side or the other, it is unlikely under these conditions that by late 3 November, or even 5 November, the nation will know who won the White House. Many House and Senate races likewise may remain undetermined. The longer the delay, the more likely political violence will erupt as a deliberate, inflected continuations of the ongoing post-\u201cGeorge Floyd\u201d unrest. The more likely, too, that law suits of various descriptions will be filed, delaying results still further. Here the partisan character of state legislatures may prove significant, and distortive, as was the case in Florida in 2000. So it\u2019s a good thing to anticipate such harmful behaviours and plan ways to limit the damage they may do. Everyone in positions of high legal and political authority in the US is today already thinking about such eventualities, and many of them, at least, have the public\u2019s best interests at heart. One example concerns an 11 August open letter written by two well-known retired military officers urging the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley to plan to forcibly remove Donald Trump from office if he ignores or otherwise tries to evade a negative November election result. The uproar following publication noted that General Milley has no such authority (while other authorities do exist for such purposes) and wondered how two reputable people could possibly get that wrong. The criticism also pointed out that urging the military to be the arbiter of political crisis disputes could hardly be more unconstitutional or injurious to civil-military relations. Yet they wrote it and a reputable magazine published it. Not Normal, and More Than Silly \u201cSilly season\u201d, what many experienced Americans have long since come to call election campaign seasons, has never been quite this silly, and certainly in my lifetime as a native son of Washington, DC, has never been as alarming for what it lacks in general probity and civic rationality. The soul of the American liberal temperament, it seems, is being mugged by the tacit but mutual agreement of a hollow and haunted political class. Each part fears and loathes the other more than they cherish and respect either We the People or their own oaths of office. The wheels are coming off fast, and make no mistake: This is not normal. The meaning for the rest of the world, whose peoples have equities in the US election outcome but no vote: For any practical purpose, you don\u2019t exist in the mind\u2019s eye of the American elite, let alone the rest of the nation. Advice: Keep it that way for now, for drawing our attention in current deranged circumstances will only bring you regret."

    "title": "Nobel Peace Prize 2020: Securing Food and Preventing Hunger",
    "author(s)": "By Dipinder S Randhawa",
    "date": "No. 178 \u2013 13 October 2020",
    "content": "THE NOBEL Peace Prize Committee has awarded the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations\u2019 World Food Programme (WFP). The Committee cited the WFP\u2019s \"efforts to combat hunger\" and its \"contribution to bettering conditions for peace in conflict-affected areas,\" describing the WFP as \"a driving force in efforts to prevent the use of hunger as a weapon of war and conflict,\" while praising the agency\u2019s \u201cimpressive ability to intensify its efforts\u201d during the COVID-19 pandemic. The WFP is the UN\u2019s primary instrument for realising the Sustainable Development Goal of eradicating hunger by 2030. It tackles chronic food insecurity reflected in the inability of 690 million people or 8.9 per cent of the world's population to access sufficient food, and acute insecurity (exposure to debilitating hunger over an extended period) suffered by 135 million people in 2019.The WFP seeks to address hunger's root causes: nutrition, market support for smallholdings, social protection and safety nets, gender inequality, income inequality, sustainable livelihoods and ecosystems, and action on climate change and disaster risk mitigation. Nobel Peace Prize\u2019s Signal In a world overshadowed by divisiveness, economic misery and the COVID-19 pandemic, this year's award has special significance. The Nobel Committee said \u201cthe need for international solidarity and multilateral cooperation is more conspicuous than ever\u201d. At a time when rising nationalism and populism are undermining multilateralism and international coordination, the Prize sends a signal that global problems require coordinated solutions. Millions today are affected by hunger that is driven by conflict and the pandemic. The need for funds is more pressing than ever before. The WFP has suffered funding constraints in recent years, as several countries, including the United States, slashed funding for international organisations. The Peace Prize is a call to the international community to fund the UN agency adequately to ensure people do not starve. The WFP\u2019s work assumes added urgency because, after decades of progress, the trend reversed in 2014 resulting in rising world hunger, driven by climate change, the growing number of conflicts around the world, and increasing inequality. The Nobel Prize is a very timely way of bringing attention to the work of the WFP. Why Food Is Critical Hunger stems from the inability to afford a sustainable diet. To survive, individuals need a certain calorific intake each day, with the number differing by age, occupation and gender. Malnutrition results in invidious effects ranging from vulnerability to disease, frequent bouts of sickness, physical weakness, impaired cognitive reasoning, and an inability to engage in productive work. The effects on children are worse. Research in recent years has shown that nutritional deprivation until the age of five, when the brain develops the most, permanently hinders children\u2019s ability to learn. Malnutrition remains endemic among children leading to stunting and wasting. Across Southeast Asia, 25.7 per cent of children under five suffer from stunting (children do not grow to reach their potential) while 8.7 per cent suffer from wasting (the child weighs less than its age-appropriate weight). These children are highly susceptible to disease and neurological impairment. The interventions required in later life to make up for learning gaps are expensive, time-consuming and difficult to implement, and many nations in Southeast Asia lack the resources to address these problems. Pandemic and Hunger The COVID-19 pandemic has upended efforts to control hunger. It may add between 83 and 132 million people to the total number of undernourished in the world. Disruptions in agricultural supply chains; the inability to work because of lockdowns and stringent social distancing measures; the absence of a social safety nets in countries with large informal sectors; school children from poor homes deprived of the one assured wholesome mid-day school meal \u2013 have all contributed to a surge in hunger. Rich countries are not immune. Even the United States has experienced unprecedented growth in hunger. Oxfam estimates that if not addressed, hunger could kill 12,000 people a day. In many countries, the odds of dying from hunger outweigh those of dying of a COVID-19 infection. The World Bank has warned that over 150 million people could be pushed into extreme poverty by next year. The WFP has aggressively stepped up efforts to reach the most deprived, stating \u201cuntil the day we have a vaccine, food is the best vaccine against chaos\". The world produces enough food to feed everyone. The challenge is to get it where it is needed the most \u2013 a task rendered more challenging by the pandemic. The most severe impact has been on developing countries, including those in Southeast Asia, driven by restrictions on mobility, imperative for controlling the transmission of COVID- 19, and fragmented agricultural markets that make it difficult to coordinate the movement of food products. Climate Change The most serious threat to food security is from climate change. The average annual number of extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts, has more than doubled since the 1990s, adding to instability in agriculture. Southeast Asia is among the regions most vulnerable to extreme weather change. It is particularly susceptible to high temperatures and increases in humidity. Events such as mass migrations, including Europe\u2019s 2015 refugee crisis, and other forced displacements due to droughts, floods, natural disasters, and political instability and strife, indicate the risks that may lie ahead. According to research presented at the Paris climate talks, nearly a third of the total arable land has been lost to soil erosion and pollution over the past 40 years, and if current food consumption patterns continue, all of the planet's forests would need to be cleared to meet the demand for food. Looking Ahead The challenges for policymakers are clear. In a deeply interconnected and globalised world, food security and elimination of hunger require a global commitment of resources. Climate change and the pandemic have aggravated the threat to food supply and human well-being. The award of the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize to the WFP is another reminder of the need to redirect human effort and government policy to quickly address the danger faced by the world\u2019s population. In the absence of a compact on multilateralism, a quick way to build on the momentum generated by the pandemic is to \u201cregionalise\u201d responses through WFP\u2019s initiatives around the world. In ASEAN, member states work with ASEAN Dialogue Partners to expand food production and protect children from malnutrition and other diseases. Such cooperation can be intensified and more long-term programmes instituted to secure food supplies and prevent hunger. ASEAN has developed two initiatives to boost food security. First, the ASEAN Plus Three Emergency Rice Reserve (APTERR) mechanism, which is a \u2018virtual stockpile\u2019 of rice pledged by ASEAN Plus Three countries (i.e. ASEAN plus China, Japan and South Korea). Second, the ASEAN Food Security Information System (AFSIS), focusing on systematic collection, analysis and dissemination of food security-related information. While ASEAN is well on the path towards ensuring aggregate food security, the immediate challenge in these extraordinary times is to ensure that those most deprived of nutrition are able to get a balanced daily diet. The global community is increasingly disorderly and disorganised in tackling the serious challenges it faces, and the potentially devastating ones that lie ahead. Peace from absence of war is not sufficient to ensure economic progress and human security. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the need for a fundamental reordering of global governance. Until a reinvigorated compact with global leadership emerges, regional approaches among partners with common purpose, as ASEAN is attempting to do, may be the next best alternative."

    "title": "Vietnam\u2019s New Leadership: Back to the Four Pillars",
    "author(s)": "By Yang Razali Kassim",
    "date": "No. 056 \u2013 3 April 2021",
    "content": "VIETNAM\u2019S TOP leadership is changing. This political transition is taking place at the 11th session of the National Assembly (NA) or legislature, currently under way amid some debate in the media whether Vietnam is an emerging middle power in Asia. The country\u2019s steady economic rise and the growing regional clout this consequently brings seems to suggest that Vietnam is on course to be one. But Vietnamese leaders themselves are reticent and cautious about such portrayals. Vietnam, to them, still has a long way to go, notwithstanding its commendable economic growth accompanied by one of the strongest militaries in the region. Whether Vietnam is a middle power or not, the trajectory to this status will be defined by the new political leadership that is currently being put in place since February\u2019s 13th Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) \u2500 the country\u2019s political backbone. By next week (8 April 2021), this new leadership team will have been finalised at the NA elections to complete the leadership transition. Whoever are elected will form the quartet of power \u2500 the so-called Four Pillars \u2500 that will shape Vietnam\u2019s political and economic direction in the new term. Back to the Four Pillars Significantly, the CPV general secretary, Nguyen Phu Trong, has stepped down as state president, a second post he took over upon the death of his predecessor Tran Dai Quang. That assumption gave Trong two out of the four most important positions in the country. The other two are the prime minister and the chair of the NA. Except for the most powerful post of party chief, which Trong continues to hold, the other three will be decided at the NA elections in an indirect system of choosing the country\u2019s leadership. In other words, the power balance in the national leadership will revert to the four-pillar structure. The fact that Trong relinquished the presidency seems to suggest that holding two powerful posts at the same time was not meant to be a permanent fixture. Trong, the longest-serving CPV chief since Le Duan, is known as a firm leader and effective anti- corruption campaigner. With Trong already in his late 70s, the quartet will be dominated by a younger team. But who are they likely to be? And will they herald change or continuity of foreign and economic policies? The New Quartet Likely to step into Trong\u2019s shoes as president is the current prime minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, 66. With his experience of running the government as well as exposure to regional and international diplomacy, Phuc will make a high-profile president, further raising Vietnam\u2019s growing prominence in the region and internationally. In that position, he is likely to continue Vietnam\u2019s pro-ASEAN diplomacy and the country\u2019s foreign policy of balancing China and the United States as the two major powers vie for influence in the South China Sea. This big power rivalry taking place at Vietnam\u2019s doorstep has been a big worry for Hanoi, one of six claimants to the disputed waters that the Vietnamese refer to as East Sea. Stepping in turn into Phuc\u2019s shoes as prime minister is likely to be Pham Minh Chinh,62, a current Politburo member and Head of the Central Organising Committee. Unlike previous prime ministers, Chinh has never been a minister or deputy prime minister, so his expected rise is an impressive elevation. Coming from a security- related background, he is also known to be a firm and decisive leader. The just-elected NA chair or parliamentary head is Vuong Dinh Hue, a 64-year-old professor of economics who had served previously as deputy prime minister and finance minister and currently holds the party post of Secretary of the Hanoi Party Committee. What the Likely New Line-Up Means There are several points of significance from the emerging Vietnamese leadership for the next lap. Firstly, the return of the four-pillar power structure means that the political direction in the next few years will remain constant and stable. This is interpreted by some in Vietnam as a \u201cbetter way to check, monitor and control power\u201d. Just as significantly, it means that the country\u2019s political elite prefers a more balanced power structure between the ruling party, the executive branch and the legislative branch, rather than the consolidation of power in one person. Secondly, the leadership renewal marks a combination of experience and freshness, a suitable formula for Vietnam\u2019s planned transition towards developed status by 2045. The leaders\u2019 main objectives are aspirational; the strategic tasks of the Vietnamese communists are to develop a prosperous and stable country, striving to be a socialist- oriented developed state. To be sure, General Secretary Trong will continue to oversee the strengthening of the party\u2019s hold on power and in the fight against corruption where his success has been proven. Meanwhile, Phuc, if he eventually gets elected as president, will leverage on his experience as prime minister to expand and strengthen Vietnam's relations with other countries. The biggest attention will be on Chinh, the likely new prime minister, whose decisiveness is seen as a quality needed for a head of government. He will have the unenviable task of steering the country towards the dual goal of rolling back and containing the pandemic while maintaining and promoting economic growth. For the new leadership, this goal is foremost. Leadership and Foreign Policy Foreign policy under the new team is likely to continue the strategy of \u201copenness, multilateralisation and diversification\u201d. This is another way of describing the search for a new balance that tilts towards the US, a former foe, in response to China\u2019s growing dominance in the South China Sea. International economic integration will continue with more free trade agreements (FTAs) being signed, thereby creating new impetus for the nation\u2019s economic recovery. Vietnam has set up a network of 17 FTAs and frameworks for economic cooperation with the world\u2019s leading economic regions. Vietnam\u2019s diplomatic foray will continue to deepen following its chairmanship of ASEAN in 2020 while its entry into the UN Security Council as a non-permanent member for one year has raised its voice on the global stage. As Vietnam pursues its balancing of China and the US, it will continue to back ASEAN\u2019s centrality amid the fluid geopolitical landscape, even as it keeps a close watch on protecting Vietnam\u2019s territorial sovereignty. On 11 March, the Vietnamese foreign ministry responded to the recent meeting of the emerging platform of Quad partners \u2500 the US, Japan, Australia and India \u2500 by urging them \u201cto respect the central role of ASEAN in the formation of regional structures\u201d. In a related signal earlier to China, reported by the Vietnamese News Agency, the deputy foreign minister Le Hoai Trung said the most important goal in Vietnamese foreign policy is to \u201cfirmly and persistently maintain national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity\u201d. \u201cThis goal has been put at the top of Vietnam\u2019s foreign policy throughout many party congresses, including the (most recent) 13th Congress,\u201d Trung said. By the end of the NA elections on 8 April, the new Vietnamese core leadership will be ready to take over. This new \u201cGroup of Four\u201d \u2500 a communist party veteran backed by a set of younger leaders \u2500 will steer Vietnam towards a more prominent regional role \u2500 regardless whether it is a middle power or not."

    "title": "Russo-EU Relations: Impact of the Navalny Factor",
    "author(s)": "By Christopher Cheang",
    "date": "No. 049 \u2013 19 March 2021",
    "content": "EUROPEAN SANCTIONS which covered travel bans and asset freezes of four top Russian officials in response to the jailing of the opposition figure Alexei Navalny did not come as a surprise. The officials are Viktor Zolotov, head of Russia\u2019s National Guard; Igor Krasnov, the prosecutor general; Alexander Kalashnikov, the Federal Penitentiary Service chief; and Alexander Bastrykin, who heads the Investigative Committee. Zolotov and Bastrykin are seen as close to President Vladimir Putin. Russia has pledged to respond to the sanctions but can be expected to calibrate its moves. Its focus in the future will be on maintaining strong links with individual European Union (EU) countries, principally Germany. EU\u2019s importance to Russia In an interview in mid-February, Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov stressed that Russia was prepared to sever its links with the EU, should the grouping impose sanctions in the wake of Navalny\u2019s imprisonment. However, his comments were meant more as a warning than a statement of intent, adding that collectively, the bloc was still Russia\u2019s largest trading and investment partner and that \u201cif business is mutually beneficial, we will continue it\u201d. Interestingly, the latest polls, released on 1 March 2021, show over half (55%) of Russians have a positive attitude of EU states, and nearly half (48%) wish for partner relations with the EU. In any case, the future of Russo-EU relations will be contingent on the state of Russia\u2019s links with Germany. Being the most populous European country with the largest economy, Russia cannot ignore Germany and hence, must bestow more importance to its links with Berlin. After China, it is Russia\u2019s largest trade partner. The Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project plays a vital role in their relationship. Germany has been under US pressure and sanctions to cancel the project; more so, in the light of the Navalny factor; not only Central European and Baltic states, but currently France as well, has called for its halt. Nevertheless, Chancellor Angela Merkel has consistently resisted attempts to link the project to Navalny\u2019s fate. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas reiterated Germany\u2019s position on the project on 10 February during a debate in the Bundestag. The Burden of History The 1941-45 war between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union and Moscow\u2019s support for German reunification, are major factors in bilateral relations. Victory Day on 9 May is widely celebrated. For Russia\u2019s leaders, it is a crucial occasion to evoke national pride and patriotism. Wittingly or unwittingly, this event also serves to remind Germany of its responsibility in the conflict. The further the war recedes into history and living memory, the more urgent and important it becomes for Moscow to ensure that this event remains ever-present in the current consciousness of both countries. German leaders have not forgotten their history with Russia. President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said in an interview earlier in February that the Nord Stream 2 project was \u201cone of the last bridges between Russia and Europe\u201d. He added with reference to the forthcoming 80th anniversary (in June) of Nazi Germany\u2019s invasion of the Soviet Union, that there had been \u201cphases of fruitful partnership, but even more times of terrible bloodshed\". While this did not justify current wrongdoing in Russian politics, Germany \u201cmust not lose sight of the bigger picture\". In reaction, Lavrov observed that he showed \u201cpolitical courage\u201d in mentioning that 2021 marked 80 years since the invasion. President Steinmeier\u2019s comments were a reiteration of Germany\u2019s long-standing awareness of \u201cits responsibility to Russia and the other post-Soviet states for the 27 million Soviet victims of the Second World War, \u201c as stated on the German MFA website of the 21st of October 2020 on German- Russian relations. Lavrov also took the opportunity to remind Germany of Soviet support of German reunification, claiming that the West \u201conly reluctantly agreed\u201d to it and that Moscow \u201cwas the main proponent of a unified Germany\u201d. In expressing concern about the current state of relations between Russia and the EU, Lavrov was careful not to blame Germany but the Baltic states and other East European countries. Russo-EU Ties after Merkel Chancellor Merkel will leave her post in September 2021 after the federal elections. Her successor as Christian Democratic Party (CDU) leader is Armin Laschet, the presumptive candidate for the chancellorship in the elections. Lavrov\u2019s comments on Germany reflect Russia\u2019s wait-and-see policy in the forthcoming post-Merkel era. Germany stands out in Russia\u2019s calibrated approach to the EU. President Putin\u2019s remarks on Russo-EU relations during the 27 January 2021 Davos Agenda 2021 online forum, are also indicative. It was not mere coincidence that he quoted the late German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl as saying \u201cthat if we want European culture to survive and remain a centre of world civilisation in the future, keeping in mind the challenges and trends underlying the world civilisation, then of course, Western Europe and Russia must be together. It is hard to disagree with that. We hold exactly the same point of view \u201c. He argued that Europe and Russia are \u201cabsolutely natural partners from the point of view of the economy, research, technology and spatial development for European culture, since Russia, being a country of European culture, is a little larger than the entire EU in terms of territory\u201d. His focus on Russia\u2019s cultural affinity with Europe was deliberate and consistent and had three goals. First, it was another subtle reminder to China that Russia cannot be taken for granted. Second, it was a renewed signal to Europe that Russia still highly valued its links there. Finally, it was an appeal to the emotions of German and European leaders, their opinion-makers and their people at large, not to isolate Russia, given Europe\u2019s own declared concerns about China\u2019s rise amid long-held and widespread speculation about a de facto Russo-Chinese alliance. However, only time will tell if his effort will bear fruit."

    "title": "Global Health Security: COVID-19 & Its Impacts Leveraging on the Pandemic: Can Modi Succeed?",
    "author(s)": "By Parama Sinha Palit",
    "date": "No. 105 \u2013 27 May 2020",
    "content": "HISTORY SHOWS that regional cooperation can strengthen after the camaraderie of and lessons learned from overcoming a major crisis affecting different countries at the same time. Such cooperation in the Asia Pacific deepened with crises like the Asian financial crisis of 1997 and the SARS epidemic of 2003. The outbreak of COVID-19 appears to have encouraged regional and multilateral cooperation too. While countries have closed borders to stall the spread of COVID-19 and have shut down internally as well, there are noticeable transboundary efforts to fight the pandemic together. These include Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s initiatives for recharging the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) to contain the crisis. Struggling to Contain COVID-19 Well before South Asia began experiencing rapid escalation in infected cases, India sensed the opportunity of utilising the pandemic for fostering greater regional collaboration. Modi, in keeping with his social media savvy image, reached out to his regional counterparts to fight the disease together. In March 2020, Modi tweeted an offer: \u201cI would like to propose that the leadership of SAARC nations chalk out a strong strategy to fight coronavirus,\u201d and added, \u201cwe could discuss, via video conferencing, ways to keep our citizens healthy. Together, we can set an example to the world, and contribute to a healthier planet.\u201d Soon after, Modi convened a videoconference with participation from all SAARC states \u2013 including Pakistan. While all the heads of the SAARC countries were present, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan stayed away with his country represented by its Special Advisor on Health Affairs. Although the proposal by Modi was hailed by the US-based Foreign Policy magazine as an attempt to position \u2018India as a leader in crafting global responses to the coronavirus even while attempting to combat it at home\u2019, the deep distrust that existed amongst India\u2019s neighbours was discernible. Failure to Bolster Solidarity While COVID-19 did push the governments of all South Asian countries to make concerted efforts to coordinate a response to fight the virus through the SAARC platform, it failed to bolster solidarity. Nepal, an old ally and a friend, for example, even accused India of spreading the virus in the country. Modi, in the meantime, has continued to push his leadership role in the region. He proposed the creation of a regional Emergency Fund for tackling and mitigating the disease in South Asia, and pledged US$10 million to its corpus, apart from calling for the formation of a rapid response team of medical personnel. India has also sent medical teams to Maldives and Nepal, and arranged medical supplies, ranging from testing kits to ventilators and medicines, to the neighbouring countries. These Indian initiatives, to help its neighbours contain the virus, are intended to project India as a responsible regional power. Despite the challenges that accompany regional cooperation, the Indian leadership has displayed a fair amount of pragmatism on this issue. Modi not only embraced the SAARC, but also appeared at the meeting of the NAM leaders. The NAM meet was his first since becoming Prime Minister. Both the SAARC and the NAM are platforms he had earlier distanced himself from; SAARC seemingly because of Pakistan- sponsored terrorism in India, and NAM presumably because of its Cold War legacy. Aiming at greater cooperation, Modi has deployed social media extensively to connect with the regional community at a time when physical distancing has become a global norm in every country to fight the pandemic. A virtual NAM meeting on the crisis, also arranged early May 2020, not only witnessed Modi emphasising collaboration for fighting the pandemic, but also highlighted growing concerns regarding the proliferation of fake news. This was perhaps his attempt to refute reports from Pakistan-based agencies relating to rising Islamophobia in India, undermining India\u2019s position globally, and therefore targeted at international audiences for bolstering its global image. Nagging Problems, India-China Rivalry While the India-led efforts at fostering a new phase of constructive regionalism is creditable, South Asia\u2019s limited success in creating a cohesive regional architecture, casts doubt on the prospects of the new endeavour. The region\u2019s ability to work together on a common agenda continues to be held hostage by the overwhelming trust deficit between India and Pakistan, China\u2019s role in South Asia and the Indian Ocean combined with the acute strategic rivalry between the two in expanding their respective influence in the Asia-Pacific. Modi, in the meantime, has also attempted to project himself beyond the region, keen on being seen as a collaborative global player, crafting global responses to this unprecedented global public health crisis. In March 2020, he, once again, broached the possibility of replicating the SAARC videoconference to the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, the current G-20 chair, this time with the G-20 leadership, which took place on 26 March 2020. India\u2019s intention of creating more strategic space and leverage for itself at regional and global forums is obvious. The pursuit of this goal, though, encounters perception problems that are largely domestic. COVID-19 highlighted communal tensions, including heightened Islamophobia gripping the country, which required Indian diplomats to reach out to Gulf countries to assuage their sentiments. The perception of rising majoritarianism and aggressive nationalistic tendencies at home also impact India\u2019s efforts to don the mantle of a responsible regional power, let alone a global player. It has been a challenge for India to decouple damaging inward- looking tendencies from the inclusive leadership role it wishes to play in regional and global affairs."

    "title": "Global Health Security: COVID-19 & Its Impacts Pandemic and Vulnerability: Lessons from Lee Kuan Yew",
    "author(s)": "By Liu Enxiao",
    "date": "No. 116 \u2013 10 June 2020",
    "content": "MORE THAN 61 years ago, on 5 June 1959, the late Lee Kuan Yew was sworn in as Singapore\u2019s first prime minister in a nine-member Cabinet. On the fifth anniversary of his passing on 23 March 2020, three invaluable lessons from Lee Kuan Yew were recalled by Han Fook Kwang as Singapore combat the COVID-19 pandemic. That timely writing is an affectionate and meaningful way of remembering Lee Kuan Yew and his spirit. As the novel coronavirus continues to take away human lives and destroy economies around the world, and as Singapore\u2019s leadership pursues a systematic way of overcoming the COVID-19 challenges, it is opportune to look again at Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s wisdom and foresight. Lesson # 1: Vulnerability & the Little Dot Gift Lee Kuan Yew was always concerned with lesson No. 1 \u2500 Singapore\u2019s vulnerability. To him, it is a reality and not a myth. Singapore, along with Monaco and Vatican City, is one of the three city-states in the world and the only truly sovereign one. Vulnerability is a hallmark of a city state, partly because of its inherent small size. It takes no rocket science to appreciate that Singapore is just a little red dot on the world map. At times, however, we may forget this, which warranted repeated reminders by Lee Kuan Yew until his death. What worried Lee Kuan Yew was the potential complacency among Singaporeans. As early as in 1970, he remarked: \u201cWhat I fear is complacency. When things always become better, people tend to want more for less work.\" His purpose of talking about vulnerability was solely to drive out any complacency, but not to get people dispirited or demoralised. He once cautioned that \u201cNo, your job as a leader is to inspire and to galvanise, not to share your distraught thoughts. You make your people dispirited.\u201d The 14th century Italian poet Dante once said: \u201cDo not be afraid; our fate cannot be taken from us; it is a gift.\u201d Today, we should probably say: vulnerability cannot be taken from us; it is a gift. Singapore is also a gift, a gift that Lee Kuan Yew built up with so much of his life. Lesson #2: Leadership & the World as It Is French Nobel Prize winner for literature Romain Rolland famously pointed out that \u201cthere is only one true heroism in the world: to see the world as it is, and to love it.\u201d Lee Kuan Yew saw Singapore as it is \u2500 small, vulnerable, multi-racial, scarce in resources, but he loved it relentlessly and with his life. In his own words: \u201cAt the end of the day, what have I got? A successful Singapore. What have I given up? My life.\u201d Singapore has defied the vulnerability and all other odds to achieve what it is today. In the process of building up Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew left abundant legacies with many words of wisdom. Two of his timeless quotes are germane as the fight against COVID-19 continues: - \u201cChange is the very essence of life. The moment we cease to change, to be able to adapt, to adjust, to respond effectively to new situations, then we have begun to die\u201d; - \u201cA nation is great not by its size alone. It is the will, the cohesion, the stamina, the discipline of its people and the quality of their leaders, which ensure it an honourable place in history.\u201d Lesson No. 2 is on the quality of leaders. Lee Kuan Yew was passionate about this. He was quoted as saying \u201c\u2026but not even my worst enemy has ever accused me of being afraid to speak my mind.\u201d Speaking up is not for the sake of being popular, because he grasped that \u201cIf you want to be popular all the time, you will misgovern\u201d and \u201cI always tried to be correct, not politically correct.\u201d Unlike some past public health crises, the COVID-19 pandemic exposes the Achilles heel of countries that never before think they are vulnerable. Its aftermath is yet to be seen, but some of its consequences are already emerging, such as undermining of global supply chains, worsening geopolitical tensions and friction, and wiping out jobs in many sectors. To beat the odds, the answer is never stop changing, never stop thinking, and never stop innovating. Leaders have to govern, offer practical ideas, and rally the people to make difficult but necessary decisions. Singapore is small, but the nation has worked as a whole in previous crises. Singapore, as a city-state, is not an aberration, as Venice was a completely sovereign state between the ninth to late 18th century and lasted for more than 1,000 years. Lesson #3: Working Buttons, Innovative Mindset For lesson No. 3, a malfunctioning call button as narrated by Lee Kuan Yew provided an intriguing story. In his mind, anything that does not work must be fixed quickly. In the early years of building Singapore, the pioneering leaders had many buttons to fix and they ensured buttons were fixed with speed and quality. Applying this to the COVID-19 crisis, there is no luxury of time; we have to take all the necessary actions to deal with any deficiency and flaw in public health coverage at each stage of the situation as more information becomes available and the required measures could be implemented. No-one really knows what is \u201cenough,\u201d and how and where the virus will next attack. How to manage the shelf lives of medical goods and their storage space? It is akin to the rush-hour syndrome in transportation, where crowding is hard to manage. In this sense, prevention is better than cure. COVID-19 is an unprecedented crisis, no prefabricated buttons can work wonders. The \u201ctoo-late\u201d mindset is toxic, because the common wisdom is that \u201cIt\u2019s never too late to mend the fence after a few sheep are lost.\u201d Going Forward: Reinventing New Buttons In this fast-changing era, it is simply not enough to just maintain the buttons diligently and make sure they work regardless of rain or shine. New buttons must be created constantly because this is a time in dire need of innovation at all levels. Innovation is the key for a nation to stand out and prosper. Inventing, reinventing and making new buttons, while fixing and maintaining old ones, will be the key going forward. Singapore has benefitted from Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s extraordinary foundational policies and wise statesmanship. COVID-19 is another big, yet transient crisis eventually to be overcome by the people working hand-in-hand with committed leadership within and outside Singapore. The essential takeaway from this pandemic is hardship and adversity will not break the cohesive and non-complacent Singapore society."

    "title": "Global Health Security COVID-19: Health Pandemic to Food Crisis?",
    "author(s)": "By Jose ML Montesclaros",
    "date": "No. 063 \u2013 6 April 2020",
    "content": "HOARDING BEHAVIOUR by households has already led to instances where supermarket shelves were cleared in many countries. Countries have also experienced disturbances in food imports/exports weeks after locking down. In China, quarantine measures led to understaffing and a \u2018collapse\u2019 in its trucking networks, with frozen meat piling up at its ports, and \u2018overcapacity\u2019 in its docks, while in Australia, the grounding of aviation has held-up food exports to Singapore and Hong Kong. It may seem logical for national governments to now panic and consider hoarding or stocking up on food, by importing more food from overseas, or restricting exports. Historical experience, however, shows that this should be the last thing they do. In a recent interview, UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Senior Economist Abdolreza Abbassian warned that if national governments themselves engaged in hoarding and panic-buying, this can potentially trigger an international food crisis. Hoarding Triggered 2007-08 Food Crisis Hoarding and panic-buying at the national government level triggered the 2007-08 food crisis, where 100-200 million people were pushed below the poverty line because food became too expensive. This led to \u2018food riots\u2019 in over 60 countries globally. The food crisis began with an innocent weather disruption, a drought hitting India in late 2006. As grains in India\u2019s storehouses were not being replenished as fast as they were being purchased, India had to resort to importing additional grains. Because imported rice was more costly, India, the world\u2019s second largest exporter then, felt it could simply tap into its exports of rice, and let other countries source their rice elsewhere. Thus, the first manifestation of hoarding was when India imposed restrictions on grain exports, to use domestically produced grains. Unwittingly, this triggered a series of further hoarding incidents, with world rice prices peaking at more than triple the pre- crisis levels by May 2008. Dangers of Speculation Despite having enough food to meet global consumption, the world trade system can still fall into crisis as it is easily perturbed by speculation among countries and traders. Fearing India\u2019s export restrictions would cause rice prices to increase, and given uncertainty about India\u2019s vulnerability to further droughts, the Philippines decided to engage in strategic buying behaviour, the second manifestation of hoarding. As Asia\u2019s largest importer of rice then, the risk of further price increases would have had a significant impact on the Philippines\u2019 total import bill, making rice more expensive for its consumers. It thus issued tenders to buy rice at US$700 and USD$1,200 per tonne in March and April 2007, very high compared to the previous world average of US$335 per tonne. It did not mind paying for rice above market prices then, as it feared prices could increase further once other countries started to catch on to its motives. If the Philippines was desperately buying rice at such prices, thought Thailand and Vietnam, the largest and third largest exporters, then other countries might follow suit. This would allow their traders to at least triple their profits! Adding fuel to the fire, the governments of Thailand and Vietnam encouraged their traders to hold onto their grains until after prices rose further. This third major hoarding incident caused prices to spiral further. Delicate Situation Today Compared to the 2007-08 crisis, the situation today is significantly worse. First, household-level hoarding, clearing of supermarkets and transport disruptions can themselves be reasons for state-level hoarding. Yet, this may only be the tip of the iceberg. The world is also facing devastating production disruptions at the scale of national emergencies. Last February, Pakistan declared a national emergency not over COVID-19, but rather, its worst locust swarm in nearly 30 years; Somalia has done the same. Thailand also suffered its worst drought in 40 years, with an anticipated 30% drop in sugar output. In March, the FAO\u2019s Sugar Price Index reached its highest level since May 2017. Additionally, slowdowns in animal feed deliveries are causing uncertainties in the future stable supply of pork, with China\u2019s pork prices more than doubling in January. Food prices in recent months have already reached their highest levels in five years, based on the FAO\u2019s Food Price Index, partly owing to extended effects of earlier disruptions: the Fall Armyworm plague infecting half of China\u2019s provinces; bushfires clearing farmlands in Australia; and the African Swine Fever in nine Asian countries. Resist Temptation to Hoard As the COVID-19 pandemic has already triggered an economic crisis, it may yet spill- over into an international food crisis if countries engaged in hoarding. The temptation to do so may be too strong to resist, though (e.g. Vietnam\u2019s recent export restrictions). First, if countries think like Thailand and Vietnam in 2007-08, hoarding allows for extra income, especially during the lockdown period. Amid disruptions and ongoing food price inflation, this allows for a bigger cut in global agricultural trade, worth US$1.5 trillion. Next, if countries think like India and the Philippines, hoarding allows for securing cheaper food for economically disadvantaged consumers, before prices rise further. Legislators may support this too, given upcoming elections seasons across multiple countries and already volatile political environments. What the world doesn\u2019t need now is another crisis, which can be triggered by such actions. If this causes riots as it did then, countries may yet lose their ability to enforce lockdowns. Smarter Approach A smarter approach is to ensure that the \u2018essential service\u2019 of food production, trade and marketing are not disrupted by the crisis. Malaysia\u2019s lockdown order has special measures to ensure sufficient workers so that these activities are uninterrupted; Australia is spending to charter flights to resume food exports; and South Korea is launching online campaigns to help farmers sell their produce. States can also temporarily redirect funding from sectors unlikely to function at this time (e.g. tourism) to boost the production of essential commodities. China\u2019s Agriculture Ministry is enriching crop/vegetable varieties, upping production standards, supporting timely harvesting of food, and strengthening supervision over food safety and quality. It\u2019s time for countries to engage a smarter approach."

    "title": "Global Health Security COVID-19 Crisis: Timely Reminder for Climate Change",
    "author(s)": "By Margareth Sembiring",
    "date": "No. 074 \u2013 17 April 2020",
    "content": "THE RESPONSES to the COVID-19 outbreak are unprecedented. Among the various measures that governments have introduced, there is one distinct characteristic that is visibly different from the usual policymaking processes. It is their readiness to relegate the economy\u2019s timeless supremacy in place of a pressing public health crisis. The extent to which the economy is pushed to yield differs across countries. Although some segments in society may have more resources to better healthcare services, the fact that the infection risk pays no regard to social economic status makes curbing its spread everybody\u2019s business. It thus gives legitimacy to bold and swift interventions regardless of the inconvenience, discomfort, and disruptions to normal day-to-day activities, and even if they disproportionately affect some socio-economic groups more than others. Environmental Silver Lining The resulting economic slowdown has cleared up skies and rivers in many parts of the world. This phenomenon shows that the economy and the environment are still standing on opposing sides. It therefore suggests that the current approaches to economic growth needs to be rethought to avert a climate crisis. The environmental reprieve brought about by such interventions is hardly surprising. Government interventions essentially force people to self-isolate, and this has brought down carbon emissions and pollution levels. In China, carbon emissions reduced by 25% in the four weeks following the Lunar New Year. India\u2019s Ganga River has got cleaner and became suitable for bathing. In northern Italy and other major cities in the world, the levels of nitrogen dioxide, a major air pollutant closely associated with factory and vehicle emissions, have visibly reduced since COVID-19 began to restrict economic activities in these places. Considering the scale of fear and human suffering associated with the virus, the environmental benefits are not a cause of celebration. After all, the winding down of the economy is not completely voluntary, and the environmental repercussions are not intentional. They are a side-effect of otherwise unlikely interventions under normal circumstances. Environment Breathes, When Economy Gives Way Regardless, the phenomenon serves as a powerful reminder that economic activities in particular are responsible for environmental degradation and climate change. A similar experience in emission drop was observed during the 2008-2009 economic crisis. These suggest that the environment can only breathe when the economy gives way. It thus calls into question whether the current vision for unlimited economic growth can truly stand side by side with the care for the planet. Governments\u2019 willingness to loosen their grip on the economy is needed to fight climate issues. This determination, however, will be a challenge. First, COVID-19 creates an immediate sense of danger. It activates a survival instinct that places human life over all other considerations. On the other hand, climate change does not project the same sense of urgency. Despite numerous projections and plausible catastrophic scenarios that have been made over the years, climate change evolves relatively slowly. Additionally, the perceptions on climate threats vary across countries because of their rather localised impacts so far. Lessons for Climate Change The COVID-19 experience provides invaluable lessons for climate change responses. When the outbreak just started to make news headlines in late 2019, there was a general impression that the virus would only be a problem in China. Outside China, there was little sense of urgency. Not much was done to get healthcare systems ready and systematically prepare the people for the eventual arrival and spread of the virus locally. The perceived government complacency could have been driven by other factors; but it is closely reminiscent of the general attitude towards climate change. The scale of disasters that COVID-19 brings is still largely unknown. However, it has now become clear that it painfully stretches healthcare systems in many countries including in advanced economies. Similarly, while climate change may impact countries and societies differently depending on their geographical characteristics, resources, and resilience, the eventual scale of catastrophes remains a mystery. The stresses they may exert on the existing systems thus cannot be underestimated. Although the novelty of the virus caught the world by surprise and can partly explain what seems like clumsy responses across the globe, climate change impacts are known. Unlike coronavirus, the warnings about climate change have been foretold for decades. The lack of bold and urgent action on it is therefore ironic. If the new coronavirus has proven that not even the rich and the powerful can be immune to the infection, even if they have access to first class healthcare services, climate disasters could be just as far-reaching and chaotic despite the technologies, infrastructure and resources put in place to protect people. Sustainable Recovery The window to avert climate calamities is fast closing. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicted that global warming may reach the 1.5 degree Celsius mark within a decade. The coronavirus situation may force human and economic activities to halt temporarily, but at the same time, it shows that things can be done differently. The stay home arrangement and the closing down of most businesses compel people to get in touch with what is the most essential. Cutting down on air travel, fine dining, shopping delights and other habits of consumerism may be inconvenient, but it certainly does not kill. That is what the current COVID-19 measures are showing us. When the coronavirus crisis is eventually over, countries will get their economies rolling again. In view of the climate crisis, governments need to seriously consider recovery packages that support climate goals. Additionally, the consumption-driven economic growth model needs rethinking since sustainable development, despite its noble vision, has thus far proven ineffective in clamping down on carbon emissions. The COVID-19 experience shows that the economy may need to make way for the environment to prevent climate disasters. A concerted global effort is imperative to move away from the current practice of using natural resources unabatedly in a bid to achieve unlimited economic growth. If the international community can work together to control COVID-19, this should also be possible for climate change."

    "title": "Global Health Security COVID-19: Bad Patch for Batam\u2019s Economy",
    "author(s)": "By Dedi Dinarto, Adri Wanto, and Leonard C. Sebastian",
    "date": "No. 054 \u2013 30 March 2020",
    "content": "THE COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in Indonesia has entered an alarming stage due to a spike in the number of positive cases. More than 1,000 cases have been reported throughout the country with Jakarta bearing the largest cluster with the total of cases around 600. The national government has now declared the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak a \u2018national disaster\u2019 and established a task force for accelerating the management of COVID-19 as well as calling citizens to avoid public crowds and work place. Batam, 45 minutes by ferry to Singapore\u2019s south, has also reported three positive cases of COVID-19, raising the number of cases in the Riau Islands Province to a total of 12 cases. One victim died last week, on 23 March 2020. The relatively small number of cases notwithstanding, the island\u2019s economy has been pummelled mercilessly over the last three months, leaving the manufacturing and tourism sectors to suffer significant losses. Batam\u2019s Tourism Going Downhill Batam\u2019s Central Bureau of Statistics (Badan Pusat Statistik) recorded that the island has set a remarkable record of attracting foreign tourists in 2019. The island welcomed almost two million tourists last year with more than half that figure comprising tourists from Singapore. Compared to 2018, the island witnessed a 3.2% increase in the number of tourists; an equivalent of more than 60,000 tourists. However, the COVID-19 outbreak has battered Batam\u2019s tourism industry due to decreased foreign tourist arrivals. Travel restrictions Singapore imposed on foreign travellers are expected to lead to a plunge in the number of foreign tourists from China, South Korea, and Taiwan who usually visit Batam via ferry from Singapore. The closure of two direct flights from China to Batam has also reduced the number of foreign tourists from the Chinese mainland. Due to the policies being implemented, the Bank Indonesia (BI) Representative in the Riau Islands Province estimated Batam to lose more than US$1 million per month from the tourism sector. Supporting sectors for tourism like hotels, restaurants, and retail outlets have been impacted greatly with the average hotel occupancy rate dropping 40 percent and hotel management requiring their employees to take unpaid leave. Industries Come to a Standstill The COVID-19 outbreak has also impacted the development of the manufacturing and industrial sectors of the island. Many factories in Batam have been forced to halt production due to supply chain uncertainty and the availability issues of raw materials from China. Although Singapore is Batam's main trading partner, majority of industries rely on raw materials from China including electronic components, plastics and industrial dye material with the total import value worth $1.1 billion in 2019. Despite growing anxiety palpable among industries, there is latent hope that industrial activity could resume because China may have turned the corner in its containment of COVID-19. The Association of Industrial Estates (Himpunan Kawasan Industri or HKI) in Batam estimates that shipments of raw materials to Batam are expected to return to normal levels by the end of March 2020. However, whether the shortage of raw material will be alleviated remains to be seen because there is no certainty that shipments of goods from China may reach its maximum potential. Local Government\u2019s Responses The Batam Manpower Office (Dinas Ketenagakerjaan) had imposed virus-mitigating measures on foreign workers to control the spread. From a total of more than 4,000 foreign workers in Batam, a quarter of the number are foreign workers from mainland China. Returning foreign workers from mainland China and other countries are required to undergo 14-day quarantine and restrictions for overseas travel are also in place. Moreover, residence permits for foreign workers have been extended to prevent overstaying. To overcome the negative impact of the pandemic, the Batam City government had also issued tax rebates to companies to tide them over during hard times and avoid unnecessary layoffs related to the coronavirus. In addition, the Bank Indonesia Representative in the Riau Islands Province had pioneered a regional grant programme to support the tourism sector as well as to offer a soft landing for businesses affected by the pandemic via the reduction in hotel tax rates and restaurant taxes. Now What? The case of Batam is not unlike the situation at the global level. Despite the responsive approach adopted by local government, the structure of Batam\u2019s underpinning economic sectors has raised the threat of unemployment due to the complete shutdown of the ailing industries. The dependence on raw materials from one source, in this case mainland China, should be a lesson for industrial players on the need to diversify their imports. When the COVID-19 crisis subsides, the local government and entrepreneurs will need to figure out how best to develop a resilient global supply chain system for Batam\u2019s economic sustainability. Another measure would be a temporary lockdown due to the potency of the contagion given the geographical position of Batam as an enclave island. This policy should be meant only to limit cross-border movements of people rather than affecting the distribution networks of goods and supplies. The local government, in this case, should work with neighbouring countries and the central government to ensure the continuity of supply of goods and services for those who are locked down on the island."

    "title": "Russia, China and the Arctic: Cooperation or Looming Rivalry?",
    "author(s)": "By Chris Cheang",
    "date": "No. 151 \u2013 28 July 2020",
    "content": "VALERY MITKO, President of the Arctic Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg, allegedly gave a document containing state secrets to Chinese intelligence in early 2018 in China's Dalian Maritime University, where he was a visiting professor, his lawyer Ivan Pavlov told CNN as reported on 17 June 2020. Nevertheless, practical considerations demand that Russia will continue to work with China in developing the Russian Arctic. Russia is, however, wary about China\u2019s growing commercial presence and may be out to do some balancing act, bringing in Japan and India to be active in the Arctic as well. Russian Interests in the Arctic Russia has economic, geostrategic and military-security interests in the region. It is keen on developing the Northern Sea Route (NSR) between Europe and Asia, as highlighted by President Vladimir Putin in his 2018 annual State-of-the-Nation address. He stressed the NSR \u201cwill be the key to developing the Russian Arctic and Far East. By 2025, cargo traffic along this route will surge tenfold to 80 million tonnes. Our goal is to make it a truly global and competitive transport route\u201d. The region also boasts immense energy and other resources which Russia has exploited and wishes to further develop. The area is part of the Far North and Far East regions which are underdeveloped and whose resources are crucial to their development. From the geostrategic and military-security angles, Russia jealously guards its sovereignty there. If a conflict were to break out between the United States and Russia, the Arctic is one region where their missiles could be launched against each other. Russia also faces NATO countries like Norway in the Arctic. Since the beginning of 2020, NATO vessels reportedly entered the Barents Sea twice, causing the Russian Northern Fleet to activate defensive activities, according to Russian media reports. In early June, it was reported that with effect from January 2021, the Northern Fleet would have the same status as Russia\u2019s four other military districts. In concrete terms, the move facilitates the Northern Fleet\u2019s defence missions in the Arctic and protection of the NSR. Chinese Interests in the Region China\u2019s interests are outlined in its 2018 Arctic Policy White Paper. In a nutshell, the paper postulates that the future of the Arctic concerns the interests of the Arctic States, \u201cthe wellbeing of non-Arctic States and that of the humanity as a whole\u201d. Stating that the governance of the Arctic requires the participation and contribution of all stakeholders, the White Paper underscores four guiding principles of \u201crespect, cooperation, win-win result and sustainability\u201d. It says China, as a responsible major country, is ready to cooperate with all relevant parties to \u201cseize the historic opportunity in the development of the Arctic\u201d, to address the challenges brought by the changes in the region. Proposing a polar version of China\u2019s trans-continental infrastructure project, subsequently to be known as the Polar Belt and Road Initiative, the White Paper calls on parties to \u201cjointly understand, protect, develop and participate in the governance of the Arctic, and advance Arctic-related cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative . . .\u201d Russian Concerns about China Russia wants to ensure that any international system of governance of the Arctic recognises its major role and significance in the region; therefore, it perceives China\u2019s inclusive approach to managing the region and in which China will play a leading role, with some trepidation. Russia would also like to confine the management of the region to the five Arctic Ocean states \u2013 Canada, Norway, the US, Denmark and Russia itself. Observations by Russian experts make its concern clear. Dmitry Trenin, Director of the Moscow Carnegie Centre, points out in an analysis in March 2020 on the Arctic that this is where \u201cthe main conflict between the Russian and Chinese strategies lies\u201d. Russian observers also criticise China\u2019s advocacy of free access to the Arctic as a case of double standards. One example is an analysis published in June 2020 in the Valdai Discussion Club, by Pavel Gudev. A leading researcher in the Russian Academy of Sciences, Russia\u2019s premier state-run think-tank, Gudev argues that \u201cChina, for example, in its White Paper on the Arctic, expressed support for the principle of freedom of navigation in the Arctic region, despite the fact that it restricts this freedom in the South China Sea\u201d. Russia regards the NSR as critical to its economic, security and geostrategic interests and is not too keen on China\u2019s expressed support for the principle of freedom of navigation in the Arctic. Russo-Chinese Cooperation in the Region Without Western participation, Russia needs Chinese assistance to develop the NSR, while China would like to develop its Polar Belt and Road Initiative. In the long-term, the NSR might serve as a possible alternative or additional waterway between China and Europe. The NSR does not have security issues like piracy, unlike the current Straits of Malacca and South China Sea route which is not only longer but vulnerable to interdiction by the US naval forces. Reportedly, China\u2019s state-owned Poly Group signed an initial agreement with Russia on the construction of the Arkhangelsk deep-sea port in October 2016. Latest reports state it is still in the planning stage. China is also keen on exploiting the Arctic\u2019s resources. China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and the Silk Road Fund are co-investors in the Yamal LNG project, investing 20 percent and 9.9 percent of the capital respectively. In April 2019, CNPC and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) each acquired a 10% stake in the Arctic LNG 2 project. In 2019, Russia and China also entered into a deal that saw state-owned companies from both sides team up to ship LNG from the Arctic. Russia\u2019s major LNG producer, Novatek, and state-owned shipping company, Sovcomflot, partnered with Chinese state firms, COSCO Shipping and Silk Road Fund, to manage a fleet of dozens of ice- breakers, to transport fuel from Novatek\u2019s plants, including Yamal LNG. In June 2019, the China National Chemical Engineering Group and Russian firm Neftegazholding agreed to develop the Payakha oilfield, with investments of US$5 billion over four years. Balancing China in the Arctic Russia is however careful about China\u2019s growing commercial presence and would like to see other Asian countries active in the Arctic too. In 2019, Japanese major trading house, Mitsui & Co., and the government-affiliated, Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corp. (JOGMEC), bought a stake in the Arctic LNG 2 project, \u201cto boost Japan's energy sources and also help bilateral relations with Russia\u201d, according to an Asahi Shimbun report dated 2 July 2019. During the September 2019 visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Russia, President Putin also invited India \u201cto participate in projects such as Far Eastern LNG and Arctic LNG 2\u201d. Media reports during and after the visit highlighted that Indian gas company GAIL (India), which has a 20-year contract to buy LNG from Gazprom, was looking to acquire a minority stake in the Arctic LNG-2. Since then, however, there have not been any updates. India and Japan are natural counterweights to China in the Arctic and have their own economic as well as strategic reasons to cooperate with Russia there. While the Mitko case might appear to be unrelated, it sends a signal to China that Russia is closely watching Chinese non-commercial activities in the Arctic. Russia needs Chinese investments to opening up its Far North and Far East regions for economic and social development and it does not have much choice but to continue working with the Chinese to achieve its socio-economic objectives in the Arctic."

    "title": "Global Health Security: COVID-19 & Its Impacts Chinese Military Expansion: Slowing but Not Stopping",
    "author(s)": "By Richard A. Bitzinger",
    "date": "No. 175 \u2013 25 September 2020",
    "content": "THE COVID-19 virus has up-ended many things. When it comes to Chinese military modernisation, however, the pandemic has blunted the pace of expansion but hardly stopped it. Overall, the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) is still on track towards meeting its twin goals of achieving \u201ccomplete military modernisation\u201d by 2035, and becoming a \u201cworld-class\u201d military by 2049. In the first place, the COVID-19 pandemic has not really affected Chinese military expenditures. Beijing announced in May that spending on national defence in 2020 would rise to 1.268 trillion yuan, or US$186 billion, an increase of 6.6 per cent over 2019. This was the lowest annual increase in more than 20 years. COVID-19\u2019s limited Impact on PLA Spending However, it is important to note that the increase in Chinese military spending has been slowing for half a decade. For example, in 2019 military expenditures were only 7.5 per cent greater than 2018, also one of the lowest increases in recent years. The increases in defence spending for 2018, 2017, and 2016 were, respectively, 8.1 per cent, seven per cent, and 7.6 per cent. In other words, for five years in a row, defence spending increases have been stuck in single digits, compared to an average annual growth rate of 10 to 15 per cent that occurred from 1999 to 2015. This appears to signal a trend that Chinese military spending will be much more modest in the years to come, predating the COVID-19 outbreak. Still, Chinese defence spending outstrips all other Asian and all European militaries, including Russia; China has become the second-largest defence spender in the world. If the PLA (as it has asserted in its defence white papers) spends one-third of its budget on equipment and R&D, then it has over $60 billion to spend on procurement \u2013 and it shows. Secondly, the COVID-19 pandemic has not appreciably slowed the modernisation of the PLA. By implementing early on a quarantine of Wuhan (the origin and centre of the COVID-19 outbreak) Beijing was able to shield much of the rest of the company from the virus\u2019 ill effects. As such, most of China\u2019s defence industrial base \u2013 which is spread out among the country \u2013 has been spared from any great disruptions. Limited Impact on PLA Procurement One sector of the Chinese defence industry that we know was adversely affected is its diesel-electric submarine (SSK) industry, since Wuhan is the centre for the manufacture of such subs. Current-model Yuan-class (Type-039A) and Song-class (Type-039) SSKs are both constructed at Wuchang Shipbuilding in Wuhan, for the PLA Navy (PLAN) and for export. Apparently, the Wuhan shipyards were temporarily closed down during the initial COVID-19 outbreak. However, according to Chinese news reports, these yards soon resumed construction of new submarines and began making up for \u201clost time\u201d. The rest of China\u2019s defence industry appears to have been untouched, and the recapitalisation and modernisation of the PLA has proceeded unabated. Since the late 1990s, China\u2019s military has been engaged in an aggressive, concerted effort to upgrade its capabilities. It has spent years pursuing a \u201cdouble construction\u201d approach of mechanisation and \u201cinformatisation\u201d in order to concurrently upgrade and digitise the PLA. This \u201ctwo-track\u201d approach has largely been achieved, and it is being succeeded by a longer-term transformation effort based on \u201cintelligentisation\u201d. Consequently, the PLA now possesses the largest navy in the world, according to the US Department of Defence. In recent years, the PLAN has acquired six Type-055 cruisers, 23 Type-052D destroyers, 30 Type-054A frigates, 12 nuclear-powered submarines, and 30 modern diesel-electric submarines. The PLAN commissioned its first indigenous aircraft carrier in 2019, with a second carrier entering service in 2023. Moreover, the PLAN operates more than 1250 short-range and medium-range ballistic missiles and cruise missiles, and over 1000 4th-generation and 5th-generation combat aircraft. Advances in Military-Civil Fusion and Artificial Intelligence As mentioned earlier, China \u201cintelligentised warfare\u201d. is shifting \u201cIntelligentisation\u201d particularly values artificial intelligence (AI) as a critical force multiplier, and as a result, Beijing is making strategic investments in AI in order to reap national security benefits. According to the US Defence Department, China AI is seeking to gain parity with other world leaders in AI by 2020, then achieve \u201cmajor breakthroughs\u201d in AI by 2025, and, finally, establish China as the global leader in AI by 2030. toward Promoting military-civil fusion (MCF) in technological innovation is a key component of this strategy. MCF is part of a long-term and \u201cwhole of society\u201d strategic effort by Beijing to position China as a \u201ctechnological superpower,\u201d by pursuing guns and butter, and having them mutually support each other. Chinese leaders are using MCF to position the country to compete militarily and economically in an emerging technological revolution. Consequently, MCF has been an integral component of nearly every major Chinese industrial or technological initiative, including \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d and the \u201cNext Generation Artificial Intelligence Plan\u201d. Chinese Military Expansion: Still on Course The COVID-19 pandemic has made hardly a dent in China\u2019s increasingly globalised ambitions to become a major superpower, and to back this up with a modern, world- class military. While Chinese defence spending growth may be slowing slightly, Beijing\u2019s capacities for becoming a global power are hardly lessening. It may not have as much to spend on its military in the coming years, but it is still able to throw a lot of money at the PLA. At the same time, China has not abandoned its militarisation of the South China Sea, its efforts to expand into the Indian Ocean \u2500 including the establishment of its first overseas military base in Djibouti, on the Horn of Africa \u2500 or its ambitious Belt-and- Road Initiative (BRI). This process has been strengthened by its continuing investments in cutting-edge technologies, particularly AI. According to the US Defence Department, China is making progress in AI-enabled unmanned surface vessels which the PLAN plans to use to patrol the South China Sea, as well as unmanned ground systems and swarming technologies. Altogether, the PLA is proceeding apace to develop a robust anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) capacity within the First Island Chain, expanding eventually further into the Pacific Ocean. Whether one wishes to call it a threat or a challenge, China\u2019s drive to become a major global power is unabated, and the COVID-19 pandemic is hardly going to make a dent in that campaign."

    "title": "The Aquino Legacy: Implications for 2022 Elections",
    "author(s)": "By Mely Caballero-Anthony and Julius Cesar Trajano",
    "date": "No. 100 \u2013 25 June 2021",
    "content": "THE PHILIPPINES\u2019 former president Benigno \u201cNoynoy\u201d Aquino III passed away on 24 June 2021, just five years after the end of his term in 2016 and after battling a lingering illness. The only son of Philippine democracy icons, the late president Corazon Aquino and Benigno \u201cNinoy\u201d Aquino Jr, Noynoy Aquino was catapulted into the presidency in 2010, a few months after the demise of his mother, with the overwhelming support of millions of Filipino voters who were sick of alleged corruption that hounded his predecessor. The visible outpouring of public grief and support across the country\u2019s political spectrum shows that the Aquino legacy endures despite the popularity of the firebrand President Rodrigo Duterte. This could have significant impact on the much-awaited campaign season for the 2022 national elections. Security and Foreign Policy The most relevant and enduring legacy of the Aquino presidency is the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) ruling that favoured the Philippines on the issue of the South China Sea (SCS). It was under the Aquino administration that the Philippines brought its case against China on South China Sea before the arbitral tribunal \u2014 a move backed by the international community, especially its key allies such as the United States and Japan. The decision to take its case to the arbitral body allowed the Philippines to push for an international approach in dealing with China and the South China Sea disputes and seek the support of its fellow ASEAN members \u2014 some of whom had their own similar disputes with Beijing. The PCA ruling came in mid-2016, shortly after the inauguration of Aquino\u2019s successor, President Duterte who chose to downplay the award in favour of pursuing a friendlier policy towards Beijing. Duterte also made public pronouncements minimising its security alliance with the US. Despite the administration\u2019s efforts to \u2018appease\u2019 Beijing, it is noteworthy that most of Duterte\u2019s cabinet members continue to cite the arbitral ruling as an important contribution of the Philippines to the international law. Clearly the Aquino legacy in this regard reverberates. Along with the arbitration-internationalisation approach, Aquino commenced large- scale military modernisation projects to address, among others, its aging hardware and have credible defence posture. These are being continued by the Duterte administration for its current military modernisation programme. Peacebuilding in Mindanao and Revitalising the Economy Another key legacy of Aquino was the revival of the stalled Mindanao peace process that led to a political settlement of a decades-long Moro rebellion led by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). Under his watch, the government and the MILF signed the Framework Agreement on Bangsamoro in 2012 and the Comprehensive Agreement on Bangsamoro in 2014, after years of intense peace talks brokered by Malaysia. Although Aquino was unable to see through the conclusion of making the agreement legally binding before the end of his term in 2016, the efforts made it easier for the incoming Duterte administration to enact the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) in 2017, leading to the creation of a new Moro autonomous region with MILF officials as the governing authorities. The BOL is the culmination of the comprehensive peace agreement forged during the Aquino administration. Without such important peace pact, the law would not have existed and armed rebellion would have been worse today in Mindanao. International and local economists and business sector credited his administration for the Philippines\u2019 annual growth rate of 6% during his term, the fastest since the 1970s. Aquino also earned respect for his fearless campaign against corruption and promoting good governance. By 2016, Aquino turned over a resurgent national economy as his legacy with fiscal sustainability. This, his supporters say, could have been used by his successor to make the economy even stronger and more inclusive. Political Missteps Aquino had its own share of critics for his administration\u2019s shortcomings. When the Philippines was severely hit by Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, his government was widely criticised for being ill-prepared and for its dismal humanitarian response. The lessons from this tragedy led to several policy innovations during and after his term that reformed the disaster management framework in the Philippines, two of which are the institutionalisation of Pre-Disaster Risk Assessment in 2014. the adoption of a National Disaster Response Plan and There was also the botched police operation in Mindanao in 2015 to capture a wanted foreign terrorist which instead led to the death of 44 police commandos in an MILF zone. This was the reason cited for Aquino\u2019s failure to get the BOL enacted before the end of his presidency. The Haiyan tragedy and the death of 44 police commandos in Mindanao had hounded Aquino until he stepped down in 2016. As social media began to rise in the Philippines as a political propaganda tool during the last years of his administration, Aquino\u2019s failings were not only amplified but also came under greater scrutiny. These, analysts have argued, significantly helped the electoral victory of Duterte in 2016, a complete anti-thesis of Aquino in terms of leadership image and political style. Duterte was projected as a strongman, a crime-buster vis-\u00e0-vis Aquino\u2019s liberal democratic image. Aquino\u2019s Legacy and the 2022 Elections"
