    "title": "E.U. Proposes New Travel Restrictions on Unvaccinated U.S. Visitors",
    "content": [
      "BRUSSELS \u2014 Back in June, the European Union urged its member countries to reopen their borders to travelers from the United States, hoping to give a boost to the continent\u2019s ailing tourism sector in the crucial summer season.",
      "It worked. American tourists flocked to the beaches of Spain and Greece, the countryside of Italy and the streets of Amsterdam and Paris.",
      "But on Monday, the European Union proposed new travel restrictions for unvaccinated visitors from the United States, a response to the alarming surge in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations across the Atlantic.",
      "In removing the United States from a \u201csafe list\u201d of countries whose residents can travel without requirements such as quarantine and testing, the European Council of the European Union, which represents governments of the bloc\u2019s 27 countries, signaled that potential restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus may remain in place for months. The new measures could deal a fresh blow to Europe\u2019s ailing tourism sector.",
      "Other countries removed from the \u201csafe list\u201d include Israel, Kosovo, Lebanon, Montenegro and North Macedonia, most which have reported a surge of cases in the past 14 days, according to a New York Times tracker.",
      "The suggested restrictions are not mandatory, and it remains up to each European Union member state to follow the guidelines. So it was not immediately clear which countries, if any, would reintroduce restrictions or when they might begin.",
      "If enforced, the new restrictions would apply to unvaccinated travelers only. The European Council already recommends that all visitors who have been inoculated with an E.U.-approved vaccine be allowed to travel. That includes the three vaccines available in the United States and manufactured by Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and Moderna, as well as AstraZeneca.",
      "Some countries have also implemented more stringent measures than others, even for visitors from a country on the safe list, yet once visitors have entered an E.U. country, they can move across the bloc freely.",
      "Under the current guidelines, unvaccinated travelers from countries on the European Council\u2019s safe list can visit E.U. countries without quarantining by showing a negative test. But a minority of countries have also kept self-isolation requirements in place, including, in some cases, for vaccinated visitors.",
      "Meanwhile, United States has remained closed to Europeans, who have expressed frustration at the lack of reciprocity.",
      "With more than 52 percent of Americans fully vaccinated, most were able to travel to Europe without hurdles this summer and can continue to do so. Yet the decision to remove the United States from the safe list could still create confusion among American tourists, said Marie Audren, the director of HOTREC, a lobbying group that represents the hospitality industry in Europe.",
      "\u201cEvery client at a hotel, a restaurant, a bar or a cafe was valuable to the tourism industry this summer,\u201d Ms. Audren said. \u201cAnd in recent years American tourists have become increasingly important to European countries.\u201d",
      "In France, Greece and Spain, U.S. visitors make up the largest contingent of tourists from non-European countries, according to data provided by tourism ministries. In others, such as Portugal, total spending by Americans is among the highest of any nationality.",
      "Yet U.S. arrivals to Europe declined by more than 80 percent last year compared with 2019, according to the European Travel Commission, a Brussels-based group that represents national tourism organizations on the continent. While figures for this summer aren\u2019t available yet, Ms. Audren said it would take years to return to prepandemic levels.",
      "Lu\u00eds Ara\u00fajo, the president of the European Travel Commission, said, \u201cFurther unjustified changes in regulations will undoubtedly negatively affect the tourism sector, which is slowly recovering from its worst crisis.\u201d",
      "In Europe, the number of coronavirus cases has remained stable this month. But the United States recorded more than 100,000 daily Covid hospitalizations over the last week, a first since the winter. E.U. officials are wary that an influx of unvaccinated U.S. visitors could drive infections up in Europe.",
      "One of the European Council\u2019s criteria for lifting restrictions is that a country should have fewer than 75 coronavirus cases per 100,000 inhabitants over the previous 14-day period. The United States has had a reported infection rate well above that threshold for weeks, according to data provided by the European Center for Disease Control, and it is classified as a red zone by the agency \u2014 the second-most risky classification.",
      "A European official with knowledge of confidential discussions leading up to the announcement, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the update to the list, said that it had been made based on the latest scientific data available, and that the infection numbers in the United States spoke for themselves."

    "title": "Stranded in Kabul: A U.S. Resident Runs Out of Options",
    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 For more than a week, Samiullah Naderi, a U.S. legal permanent resident, waited days and nights with his wife and son outside the airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, hoping to be let in so that they could leave on one of the dozens of daily flights headed to America.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s 50 feet away,\u201d Mr. Naderi, 23, known as Sammy, said Sunday night in a short telephone interview, speaking in halting English, as gunfire crackled in the background. \u201cMaybe the Taliban will let me inside \u2014 maybe.\u201d",
      "But on Monday, after being told that no more people would be allowed inside the airport gate, Mr. Naderi and his family returned to their apartment in Kabul with no clear path back to Philadelphia, where he has been living since last year.",
      "\u201cAll flights are closed,\u201d he said with an incredulous laugh. \u201cI am scared.\u201d",
      "Mr. Naderi is among at least hundreds of U.S. citizens and potentially thousands of green card holders who are stranded in Afghanistan at the end of a 20-year war that culminated not in a reliable peace, but with a two-week military airlift that evacuated more than 123,000 people.",
      "The evacuations continued through the last U.S. military flight out of Kabul, which departed Monday night, as the Biden administration pledged to help as many as 200 Americans who remained escape from what they fear would be a brutal life under Taliban rule.",
      "\u201cThe bottom line: Ninety percent of Americans in Afghanistan who wanted to leave were able to leave,\u201d President Biden said on Tuesday. He said the U.S. government alerted Americans 19 times since March to leave Afghanistan.",
      "\u201cAnd for those remaining Americans, there is no deadline,\u201d he said. \u201cWe remain committed to get them out if they want to come out.\u201d",
      "About 6,000 Americans, the vast majority of them dual U.S.-Afghan citizens, were evacuated after Aug. 14, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said Monday. The State Department has not provided numbers for how many permanent legal U.S. residents have also been evacuated or \u2014 as in Mr. Naderi\u2019s case \u2014 failed to get on a flight out. Immigration and refugee advocacy groups estimated that thousands remained.",
      "Mr. Blinken described \u201cextraordinary efforts to give Americans every opportunity to depart the country,\u201d as diplomats made 55,000 calls and sent 33,000 emails to U.S. citizens in Afghanistan, and in some cases, walked them into the Kabul airport.",
      "\u201cWe have no illusion that any of this will be easy or rapid,\u201d Mr. Blinken said at the State Department\u2019s headquarters in Washington. \u201cThis will be an entirely different phase from the evacuation that just concluded. It will take time to work through a new set of challenges.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut we will stay at it,\u201d he said.",
      "Several members of Congress had demanded that the U.S. military stay in Afghanistan until American citizens, permanent residents and an estimated tens of thousands of Afghans eligible for special immigrant visas could be evacuated. But by this weekend, the lawmakers sounded resigned in acknowledging that many would be left behind.",
      "\u201cOur team will continue to work to safely evacuate American citizens and Afghan allies and to reunite families and loved ones,\u201d Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, said on Twitter late Sunday night. \u201cI urge the State Department and the rest of our government to continue to use every tool possible to get folks to safety, deadline or not.\u201d",
      "Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, excoriated Mr. Biden\u2019s remarks on Tuesday as a show of \u201ccallous indifference to the Americans he abandoned behind enemy lines.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe promised the American people that our troops would stay until every American was out,\u201d Mr. Sasse, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement.",
      "The chaotic effort to locate, contact and then speed American citizens in Afghanistan to safety was mired, officials and advocacy groups said, by a lack of coordination across the U.S. government, frustrated attempts at outreach by the State Department, and increasingly frequent warnings of possible attacks that forced airport gates to close and meeting points to be moved.",
      "Relief groups in the United States that helped American citizens and Afghans who worked with the U.S. government described a heartbreaking and dizzying process in which people trying to escape were routed, then rerouted, to pickup points across Kabul where they were to board buses or join caravans headed to the airport, but were blocked along the way.",
      "Some people reported that Taliban fighters at checkpoints took their American passports, the relief workers said. Others said they were harassed or beaten as they made their way to meeting points, and were unwilling to again put themselves and their families in harm\u2019s way. And some said they were turned back by American troops standing guard at the airport gate.",
      "\u201cWhy can\u2019t we get people out?\u201d said Freshta Taeb, the American-born daughter of an Afghan refugee, who provides emotional counseling and translation services for Afghan immigrants in the United States, including those who worked with the U.S. military.",
      "Ms. Taeb blamed the Biden administration for a military withdrawal that she said \u201cwas done haphazardly, was done sloppily.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was time to create a plan and do what needed to be done to get these people out,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t seem like there was a strategy behind this.\u201d",
      "Ross Wilson, who was the top U.S. diplomat in Afghanistan and was on the last military flight to depart, said Monday on Twitter that \u201cclaims that American citizens have been turned away or denied access\u201d to the airport in Kabul \u201cby Embassy staff or US Forces are false.\u201d",
      "In Washington, officials have struggled to keep up.",
      "Military officials had privately accused the State Department of moving too slowly to process a crush of people begging to be evacuated. State Department officials, already facing a backlog of visa applications from Afghans that began during the Trump administration, focused first on finding Americans and verifying their citizenship.",
      "Officials said a small but unspecified number of U.S. citizens had signaled that they did not want to escape Afghanistan, unwilling to give up their homes, jobs or schooling, or refusing to leave behind relatives, including elderly parents who were not Americans and otherwise had no way out.",
      "Foreign-born spouses of American citizens, and their unmarried children who are under 21, are eligible to immigrate to the United States after receiving certain approvals, a process that was expedited for some Afghans during the evacuation. Extended family members, like parents, siblings and other relatives, must go through an immigration process that Jenna Gilbert, the director of refugee representation at Human Rights First, said could take \u201can extraordinarily long\u201d time.",
      "But there are no plans to change visa requirements for extended family members who would have to \u201ctravel to the United States under other forms of eligibility,\u201d Ned Price, the department\u2019s spokesman, said Friday.",
      "The Kabul airport is not expected to be fully functioning for some time without the American military, although the Biden administration is leaning on allies, including Turkey and Qatar, to take over some of the operations to facilitate small charter flights for people who want to leave, Mr. Blinken said. The State Department is also weighing how to protect American citizens and Afghans at high risk of Taliban reprisals who drive to one of several neighboring nations, and seek safe passage to the United States from there.",
      "Mr. Naderi said on Tuesday he was not sure of what to do, but was looking at leaving Afghanistan over its border with either Pakistan or Tajikistan. As proof of his American residency, he provided an image of his green card, which he received last year, and said he had been living with his father in Philadelphia with hopes of moving his wife and son to the United States. (The State Department would not comment on his case, citing privacy concerns.)",
      "He returned to Afghanistan on Aug. 10 to gather immigration documents for his wife and son, said his father, Esmail Naderi, who had worked for several American military contracting firms in construction and other fields from 2004 to 2015.",
      "Five days later, the Taliban seized power and the U.S. Embassy in Kabul closed as diplomats were evacuated to the airport.",
      "Getting the proper visas for the family in time was not possible. \u201cMy situation is really bad right now,\u201d Samiullah Naderi said Tuesday."

    "title": "Israel\u2019s Spy Agency Snubbed the U.S. Can Trust Be Restored?",
    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The cable sent this year by the outgoing C.I.A. officer in charge of building spy networks in Iran reverberated throughout the intelligence agency\u2019s Langley headquarters, officials say: America\u2019s network of informers had largely been lost to Tehran\u2019s brutally efficient counterintelligence operations, which has stymied efforts to rebuild it.",
      "Israel has helped fill the breach, officials say, its robust operations in Iran providing the United States with streams of reliable intelligence on Iran\u2019s nuclear activities, missile programs and on its support for militias around the region.",
      "The two countries\u2019 intelligence services have a long history of cooperation and operated in virtual lock step during the Trump administration, which approved or was party to many Israeli operations in its shadow war against Iran.",
      "That changed after the election of President Biden, who promised to restore the nuclear agreement with Iran that Israel so vigorously opposed. In the spring, Benjamin Netanyahu, then Israel\u2019s prime minister, even curtailed intelligence sharing with the United States because he did not trust the Biden administration.",
      "The challenge for the two countries \u2014 as Israel\u2019s new prime minister, Naftali Bennett, meets with Mr. Biden at the White House on Thursday \u2014 will be whether they can rebuild that trust even as they pursue contradictory agendas on Iran. The Biden administration favors a diplomatic approach, reviving and building on the 2015 nuclear agreement, while Israeli officials say that only force can stop Iran from building an atomic bomb.",
      "A key goal for Mr. Bennett will be to determine whether the Biden administration will continue to support Israel\u2019s covert operations against Iran\u2019s nuclear program, senior Israeli officials said.",
      "Israeli officials hope that any new deal with Iran will not limit such operations, which in the past have included sabotage of Iranian nuclear facilities and the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists.",
      "The White House meeting comes just weeks after William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, traveled to Israel to meet his counterpart, David Barnea, as well as Mr. Bennett, a sign of the importance of intelligence cooperation to the bilateral relationship.",
      "\u201cThe sharing of intelligence and operational activity between Israel and the United States is one of the most important subjects on the agenda for the meeting,\u201d said Maj. Gen. Aharon Zeevi Farkash, a former director of Israeli military intelligence. \u201cIsrael has developed unique capabilities for intelligence collection in a number of enemy countries, capabilities that the United States was not able to grow on its own and without which its national security would be vulnerable.\u201d",
      "In his meeting with Mr. Biden, Mr. Bennett\u2019s hand will be strengthened by the fact that the United States has become more dependent on Israel for information on Iran. The United States has other sources of information, including electronic eavesdropping by the National Security Agency, but it lacks the in-country spy network Israel has.",
      "The risk of such dependence became clear in April when Israel set off explosives at Iran\u2019s Natanz nuclear plant.",
      "Mr. Netanyahu had ordered his national security officials to reduce the information that they conveyed to the United States about planned operations in Iran, American and Israeli officials said.",
      "And on the day of the attack, Israel\u2019s foreign intelligence agency, the Mossad, gave the United States less than two hours\u2019 notice, according to American and Israeli officials, far too short a time for the United States to assess the operation or ask Israel to call it off.",
      "Israeli and American officials interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified operations.",
      "Israeli officials said they took the precautions because Americans had leaked information about some Israeli operations, a charge U.S. officials deny. Other Israeli officials say the Biden administration had been inattentive to their security concerns, too focused on reviving the Iran nuclear agreement that President Donald J. Trump had pulled out of.",
      "In Washington, many American officials said they believed that Mr. Netanyahu was just resuming the grudge he had held against the Obama administration, which negotiated the nuclear deal with Iran.",
      "The last-minute notification of the Natanz operation was the starkest example that Israel had changed its procedures since the Trump presidency.",
      "Senior Biden administration officials said that the Israelis, at least in spirit, had violated a longstanding, unwritten agreement to at least advise the United States of covert operations, giving Washington a chance to object.",
      "Mr. Burns called his counterpart, Yossi Cohen, the Mossad chief, expressing concern over the snub, according to people briefed on the call.",
      "Mr. Cohen said that the belated notification was the result of operational constraints and uncertainty about when the Natanz operation would take place.",
      "For the American-Israeli intelligence relationship, it was another a sharp turnabout.",
      "Relations had soured during the Obama era.",
      "The Obama White House, concerned that Israel was leaking information, kept the existence of the negotiations with Iran secret from Israel, a former Obama administration official said. Israeli intelligence learned of the meetings from its own sources.",
      "Mr. Netanyahu was also convinced that American spy agencies were keeping him under surveillance, according to a former Israeli official.",
      "During the Trump administration, cooperation reached new highs.",
      "When the Mossad stole Iran\u2019s nuclear archive in 2018, the only foreign officials briefed in advance were Mr. Trump and his C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo.",
      "Israeli officials used the documents to convince Mr. Trump that Iran had an active nuclear weapons program, and Mr. Trump cited them when he withdrew from the nuclear agreement months later, a major victory for Mr. Netanyahu.",
      "\u201cThis was clever use of intelligence,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu told The New York Times in 2019.",
      "Iran has denied that it seeks a nuclear weapon, but the archives showed that Iran had a nuclear weapons program as recently as 2003. According to American intelligence officials, no evidence has emerged that the program continued.",
      "During meetings with senior Trump administration officials in late 2019 and early 2020, Mr. Cohen presented a new Iran strategy, arguing for aggressive covert operations to sabotage Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities and killing key personnel to force Iran to accept a stricter agreement.",
      "Israel began a wave of covert operations, keeping the Trump administration in the loop on a series of cyber and bombing attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities and on the assassination of Iran\u2019s chief nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, in November 2020, after the American election but before Mr. Biden took office.",
      "The two countries also cooperated on two operations in 2020: a U.S. operation to kill the leader of Iran\u2019s paramilitary Quds Force, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, and an Israeli operation to kill a Qaeda leader who had taken refuge in Tehran.",
      "Mr. Pompeo, who later served as secretary of state, said that there was no relationship more important during his four years in the Trump administration than the one that the C.I.A. had with the Mossad.",
      "\u201cThe two organizations really had a moment, an important moment in history,\u201d he said in an interview in June.",
      "But the warmth of the Trump years quickly gave way to chillier relations this year. The Biden administration\u2019s announcement of its plan to return to the Iran nuclear deal and repeated delays of visits by Israeli intelligence officials to Washington deepened skepticism of the new administration in Israel.",
      "Mr. Cohen sought to repair the relationship with the United States during his final months as Mossad chief, a senior Israeli official said.",
      "On his final visit to Washington in April, a little more than two weeks after the Natanz bombing, he met with C.I.A. officials and Mr. Biden, promising a more transparent intelligence relationship. Mr. Burns gave him a warm reception, and an award for fostering the close partnership between the Mossad and the C.I.A.",
      "\u201cYou have people within both intelligence organizations that have had relationships for a very long time,\u201d said Will Hurd, a former C.I.A. officer and former member of the House Intelligence Committee. \u201cThere is a closeness and an ability to potentially smooth out some of the problems that may manifest from the leaders.\u201d",
      "Arguably as important in rebooting the relations between the two spy shops was the departure of Mr. Netanyahu from the prime minister\u2019s office.",
      "Mr. Bennett says he wants to open a new chapter in relations with the White House, and has promised a more constructive approach.",
      "But the Mossad is already planning more secret operations in Iran. The question for the Biden administration is which are acceptable and when, General Zeevi Farkash said.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. and Israel must jointly identify the red lines so that if Iran crosses them, Israel can act to prevent it from achieving military nuclear capacity,\u201d he said."

    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The United States and 97 other countries said on Sunday that they would continue to take in people fleeing Afghanistan after the American military departs this week and had secured an agreement with the Taliban to allow safe passage for those who are leaving.",
      "The Taliban\u2019s chief negotiator, Sher Mohammed Abas Stanekzai, had announced on Friday that the group would not stop people from departing, no matter their nationality or whether they had worked for the United States during the 20-year war.",
      "The joint statement released on Sunday on behalf of more than half of the world\u2019s governments and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization said that they had \u201creceived assurances from the Taliban\u201d that people with travel documents showing they were clear to enter any of those countries could safely depart.",
      "The countries also pledged to \u201ccontinue issuing travel documentation to designated Afghans\u201d and cited a \u201cclear expectation of and commitment from the Taliban\u201d of their safe passage.",
      "\u201cWe note the public statements of the Taliban confirming this understanding,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Notably missing from the statement were Russia and China, two permanent members of the U.N. Security Council who have pledged to help the Taliban rebuild Afghanistan.",
      "The statement came on the same day Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that the United States was unlikely to keep diplomats in Afghanistan after the American military departs on Tuesday. Officials said it was expected that the U.S. mission to Afghanistan would open a diplomatic mission in a country elsewhere in the region, in part to continue helping the surge of expected refugees obtain necessary departure documents.",
      "The statement did not warn of any consequences should the Taliban renege on the agreement, although a senior State Department official said it was meant to convey an implicit message about incentives \u2014 namely, foreign aid to the government \u2014 that the international community would use to enforce it.",
      "The chief American envoy to Taliban peace talks, Zalmay Khalilzad, tweeted on Saturday that the Taliban\u2019s assurances were \u201cpositive\u201d and that \u201cwe, our allies, and the international community will hold them to these commitments.\u201d",
      "That stood in stark contrast to the tens of thousands of Afghans who relief agencies said feared being left behind and living under Taliban rule. That includes those who worked for the American military or the U.S. Embassy since 2001 and were eligible to immigrate to the United States.",
      "\u201cMost of the guys that we\u2019re tracking now are terrified to even try to go through Taliban checkpoints,\u201d said Michael P. Mulroy, a former C.I.A. officer and top Middle East policy official at the Pentagon during the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cSo when we\u2019re not there, when the entire focus of the world isn\u2019t on the Taliban, I have zero inclination that they will do anything but probably prosecute, and in many cases execute, people who worked really closely with the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Mulroy said on Saturday.",
      "Tens of thousands of the Afghans who had worked for the United States were believed to be among the more than 114,400 people evacuated so far from the international airport in Kabul, the capital, since Aug. 14. That total also included nearly 5,500 U.S. citizens, including 50 over the last day alone, most of whom hold American and Afghan passports.",
      "The State Department said an additional 350 Americans were still waiting to be evacuated as of Saturday and estimated that another 280 who claimed to have U.S. citizenship had either signaled they would not leave or had not committed to it.",
      "Sunday\u2019s joint statement was the latest in a series of diplomatic moves to compel the Taliban to pursue terrorists, uphold human rights and form an inclusive government after its fighters seized power from the country\u2019s Western-backed leaders on Aug. 15. It is a remarkable \u2014 and uncomfortable \u2014 shift for the United States and its closest allies, who invaded Afghanistan after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and regarded the Taliban as an enemy.",
      "In his statement on Friday, Mr. Stanekzai, the Taliban negotiator, said \u201cwe have no issues\u201d with Afghans\u2019 traveling abroad for medical treatment, business, education or what he vaguely described as other reasons. \u201cNo one will prevent you from traveling,\u201d he said, according to a partial transcript of his remarks that a U.S. official provided to The New York Times.",
      "But Mr. Stanekzai said Afghan citizens needed first to obtain passports from the Afghan interior ministry and then to try to secure visas and other approved travel documents from foreign governments before they could leave. At best, it is a process that could take months, if not years; at worst, it will alert the Taliban as to who does not want to live under their rule.",
      "Another impediment to departures is the international airport in Kabul, and who will run it after American troops leave on Tuesday. At that point, the airport will be under the control of the Taliban.",
      "Officials from Turkey, Qatar and the Group of 7 nations planned to meet on Monday to discuss the future of Afghanistan, including the airport, two officials familiar with the talks said on Saturday.",
      "Ned Price, the State Department spokesman, said on Friday that it was \u201cprobably unreasonable\u201d that the airport would be operating normally immediately after the U.S. troops withdrew. But, he said, officials were in talks with allies, and the Taliban, to get nonmilitary flights resumed as quickly as possible \u2014 in part to \u201cprovide opportunity for Afghans who may wish to leave the country.\u201d",
      "He would not comment on reports that Turkey and Qatar were planning to run the airport with the Taliban."

      "The disintegration of diplomacy was a stunning turnabout from plans to stay and help Afghanistan transition from 20 years of war and to work toward peace, however tenuous, with a government that would share power with the Taliban. This month, Mr. Blinken had pledged that the United States would remain \u201cdeeply engaged\u201d in Afghanistan long after the military left.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s one in which we will lead with our diplomacy,\u201d Mr. Blinken said, commending the U.S. diplomats, troops and other personnel who had worked at the embassy, which just last month had employed around 4,000 people \u2014 including 1,400 Americans.",
      "Left uncertain was whether American efforts to stabilize the Afghan government would continue \u2014 the main thrust of years of painstaking work and negotiations with leaders in Kabul that were supported by billions of dollars in American taxpayer funding.",
      "Instead, Mr. Blinken said that any engagement with the Taliban \u2014 a longtime U.S. enemy that seized power when President Ashraf Ghani fled Afghanistan on Aug. 15 \u2014 \u201cwill be driven by one thing only: our vital national interests.\u201d",
      "Exactly four weeks earlier, on Aug. 2, Mr. Blinken had left little doubt that the Biden administration intended to keep the U.S. Embassy in Kabul open.",
      "\u201cOur partnership with the people of Afghanistan will endure long after our service members have departed,\u201d he said then. \u201cWe will keep engaging intensely in diplomacy to advance negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban with the goal of a political solution, which we believe is the only path to lasting peace.\u201d",
      "As many as 200 American citizens, and tens of thousands of Afghans, were left behind in a two-week military airlift that Mr. Blinken called one of the largest evacuation efforts in U.S. history. He demanded that the Taliban keep its word and allow them to leave safely once they had exit documents in hand.",
      "More than 123,000 people were evacuated from Kabul in recent weeks, including about 6,000 Americans.",
      "Mr. Blinken also said that the United States would closely watch the Taliban\u2019s efforts to stanch terrorism in Afghanistan, as the group has said it will do, and would continue to work with the international community to provide humanitarian aid to millions of Afghans who need food, medicine and health care after decades of war and political instability.",
      "He struck a resolute tone about the diplomatic retreat, and in reminding Americans about the cost of the conflict.",
      "America\u2019s longest war, with its casualties and the resources that were sunk into it over the past 20 years, \u201cdemands reflection,\u201d Mr. Blinken said.",
      "\u201cWe must learn its lessons, and allow those lessons to shape how we think about fundamental questions of national security and foreign policy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe owe that to future diplomats, policymakers, military leaders, service members. We owe that to the American people.\u201d"

    "content": [
      "HANOI \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris said on Thursday that the United States would work with its allies to protect women and children in Afghanistan, as the Taliban takeover forced her to confront troubling historical parallels and diverted attention from her original mission on a five-day trip to Southeast Asia.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no question that any of us who are paying attention are concerned about that issue in Afghanistan,\u201d said Ms. Harris, referring to the protection of women and children in that country.",
      "The vice president made her comments in the Vietnamese capital, Hanoi, on the final day of her trip to Southeast Asia, a key part of the Biden administration\u2019s strategy to forge partnerships in the region and refocus American foreign policy on competing with China\u2019s rising influence.",
      "For Ms. Harris, the trip was an opportunity to assert herself on the world stage after her first overseas trip to Central America, one centered on addressing the root causes of migration, was marred by political backlash against the Biden administration\u2019s response to soaring crossings at the southwest border.",
      "Ms. Harris has faced the steep challenge of reassuring partners in Asia, and across the world, that the United States can still be a credible ally amid the Taliban\u2019s swift takeover of Afghanistan and the United States\u2019 haphazard evacuations.",
      "With the Biden administration racing to meet an Aug. 31 deadline to leave Afghanistan, the situation in Kabul has cast a shadow over a trip meant to focus on public health, supply chain issues and economic partnerships.",
      "In Singapore, whether it was at her meeting with the city-state\u2019s leaders or during her tour of orchids after a high-stakes foreign policy speech, Ms. Harris consistently faced questions about the withdrawal, the future of human rights in Afghanistan and the fate of those who had risked their lives to assist American troops in the 20-year war.",
      "In Hanoi, the pressure did not relent \u2014 particularly after the world witnessed images of desperate Afghans rushing behind U.S. military planes, drawing comparisons to the United States\u2019 evacuation from Vietnam in 1975.",
      "On Thursday, Ms. Harris did not directly answer a question about whether Americans were safer now than they had been before the withdrawal from Afghanistan. Instead, she touted the administration\u2019s evacuation effort, which has swiftly ramped up in recent days.",
      "Biden administration officials have said they have evacuated tens of thousands of people since Aug. 14, the day before Kabul fell to the Taliban. Most Americans have been flown out, although tens of thousands of Afghan allies will almost certainly be left behind after the Aug. 31 deadline.",
      "During her trip, Ms. Harris stayed on message, emphasizing that the administration was \u201csingularly focused\u201d on evacuating remaining American citizens and Afghan allies.",
      "Her flight to Hanoi on Tuesday from Singapore was delayed for three hours because of what the United States Embassy in Vietnam described as a possible \u201canomalous health incident.\u201d That is the language the Biden administration uses to refer to the so-called Havana syndrome \u2014 the unexplained headaches, dizziness and memory loss reported by scores of State Department officials, C.I.A. officers and their families in various countries. Asked about the report, Ms. Harris said only that officials were looking into it.",
      "Ms. Harris used the trip to Southeast Asia not just to forge partnerships on climate change, cybersecurity and the pandemic, but also to issue her most blunt comments yet on Beijing.",
      "Both Beijing and Washington have homed in on Southeast Asia as a region of economic and geopolitical importance. Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam have all accused China of building and fortifying artificial islands in the South China Sea, and dispatching ships to intimidate their militaries and those who fish.",
      "On Wednesday, Ms. Harris offered to send aircraft carriers and a Coast Guard cutter to Vietnam, in addition to a donation of one million doses of Covid-19 vaccines.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to Beijing, let me be very clear,\u201d she said. \u201cWe welcome stiff competition, we do not seek conflict, but on issues like you raise, the South China Sea, we are going to speak up.\u201d",
      "The tension between the United States and China loomed over the entirety of Ms. Harris\u2019s trip \u2014 even when she was in the air. Beijing took advantage of her delayed flight to Hanoi to dispatch an envoy to meet with Vietnam\u2019s prime minister and pledge a donation of two million doses of coronavirus vaccines \u2014 double the size of the U.S. donation.",
      "After that meeting, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh of Vietnam declared that his country \u201cdoes not ally with one country to fight against another,\u201d according to Vietnamese state media.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s striking,\u201d said Aaron Connelly, a research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Singapore. Chinese officials, he said, \u201cbelieve they have the advantage and are trying to make it clear to Southeast Asian counterparts that there will be costs to engaging with the United States.\u201d"

    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Two decades ago, President George W. Bush denounced the Taliban for \u201caiding and abetting murder\u201d after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.",
      "Now, as President Biden ends the war Mr. Bush started, the United States is locked in an uneasy partnership with that very enemy force, relying on the Taliban to help safeguard American citizens and their Afghan allies as they race to evacuate the country.",
      "It is an improbable battlefield relationship: Diplomats, spies and military officials for the United States are having cooperative discussions with their Taliban counterparts, as the group serves as America\u2019s first line of defense at the airport in Kabul, the Afghan capital, screening passengers for documents and weapons.",
      "That relationship appears to have failed spectacularly on Thursday, American military officials said, when rival terrorists managed to pass through Taliban checkpoints around the airport and set off a suicide bomb that killed 13 American troops and scores of Afghan civilians.",
      "The grim incident \u2014 and the warnings by administration officials that more attacks are possible, even likely, in the days ahead \u2014 underscores the precarious position that Mr. Biden finds himself in after overruling his military advisers in the spring and ordering a total withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan by the end of August.",
      "Mr. Biden has received broad criticism for his handling of the withdrawal, even from many Democrats. Republicans who eagerly supported President Donald J. Trump\u2019s months of negotiations with the Taliban are now savaging Mr. Biden for leaning on the new rulers of the country. But once the Taliban toppled the Afghan government on Aug. 15, the imperative was set, according to Mr. Biden and his top generals. During the last 10 days, they have described a necessary, if distasteful, working arrangement.",
      "\u201cNo one trusts them,\u201d Mr. Biden said Thursday evening as he denounced the terrorist attack by ISIS-K, an Islamic State affiliate and a rival to the Taliban. \u201cWe\u2019re just counting on their self-interest to continue to generate their activities. And it\u2019s in their self-interest that we leave when we said and that we get as many people out as we can.\u201d",
      "Contact between the United States and the Taliban, the enemy in a war that took the lives of more than 2,400 American troops, is not unprecedented.",
      "President Barack Obama approved talks with the Taliban in 2010 to free Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, an American soldier who was captured by the group the year before.",
      "During the Trump administration, the United States sought direct peace talks with the Taliban in hopes of ending the conflict. Zalmay Khalilzad, an Afghan-born former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, Iraq and the United Nations, was brought in to lead the negotiations, which slogged on for nearly two years in the Qatari capital, Doha.",
      "At one point in 2019, the talks appeared so close to success that Mr. Trump sought to bring the Taliban to the presidential retreat at Camp David for a victory announcement. The trip was quickly scuttled by a suicide bombing by the Taliban in Kabul that killed 12 people, including an American soldier.",
      "Officials working for Mr. Trump cut a deal with the Taliban leadership last year to end America\u2019s presence in Afghanistan by May 1, a deadline Mr. Biden pushed back until Aug. 31.",
      "U.S. officials on Friday angrily denied reports that they had handed over to the Taliban lists of vulnerable Afghans who were trying to make it to the airport. One U.S. official said Taliban fighters at checkpoints were allowed to review manifests as buses approached the group\u2019s cordon, but not to keep the lists.",
      "Thursday night, even as they continued to work with the Taliban after the airport attack, two U.S. officials said the C.I.A. blew up Eagle Base, a site on the outskirts of Kabul used throughout the war to train Afghan counterterrorism forces, to keep it out of the group\u2019s hands. The operation was a raw example of how complicated the relationship is between the United States and the Taliban.",
      "The Biden administration initially had no intention of working with the Taliban during the evacuation this month, according to American officials briefed on the plan.",
      "When the first of the almost 6,000 troops that Mr. Biden authorized started arriving in Kabul this month, military commanders believed they would be working with the Afghan government\u2019s security forces to help ferry Americans and others to safety. But by Aug. 15, when the Taliban swept into Kabul and President Ashraf Ghani fled the city, his security forces ceased to function.",
      "That day, Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., a Marine who leads U.S. Central Command, met with Taliban leaders, telling them not to interfere with the evacuation. Taliban officials told General McKenzie that security was deteriorating in Kabul, and that they had to act swiftly to secure the city.",
      "At that meeting, the Taliban offered to set up a liaison system to discuss security matters, according to a U.S. official briefed on the meeting.",
      "During the last two weeks, there have been periodic conversations between the Taliban official in charge of security in Kabul and American military commanders, including Rear Adm. Peter G. Vasely. Those conversations reflect a pragmatic relationship of necessity, the U.S. official said. The military conversations were tactical conversations and are not expected to continue past the end of the evacuation mission on Aug. 31, the official added.",
      "Thomas Joscelyn, who has tracked the details of the Afghanistan war at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies\u2019 Long War Journal, said such tactical discussions were probably necessary.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a certain amount of tactical talking that needs to be done here because they\u2019re face to face, and there needs to be some tactical deconfliction,\u201d he said.",
      "After the bombing on Thursday, General McKenzie said the U.S. military had asked the Taliban to make adjustments to their security cordon and to close specific roads that the United States had identified as sources of threats.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to be prepared for those attacks. That includes reaching out to the Taliban,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we will continue to coordinate with them as they go forward.\u201d",
      "American officials still believe they can rely on the Taliban to stop attacks from the Islamic State or other terrorist groups, with sharp limits that were demonstrated this week. The Taliban leadership and Islamic State are enemies who have repeatedly battled inside Afghanistan.",
      "But even before the bombing that killed dozens, U.S. officials said the mass release of prisoners that the Taliban allowed as they took over the country was a clear sign that the Taliban would act in unreliable ways, allowing developments that could endanger the United States.",
      "Once the evacuation is complete, much of the regular communication with the Taliban could fall to the C.I.A. The spy agency is given the task of dealing with unsavory partners and governments around the world. The C.I.A. acts covertly, so its discussions with the Taliban can be more easily shielded from public view.",
      "The agency\u2019s highest-profile diplomatic foray, the Monday visit to Kabul by its director, William J. Burns, could be the beginning of a series of engagements over the coming years. But how much the C.I.A. talks to and cooperates with the Taliban will probably depend on their behavior. If the Taliban allow strikes against Islamic State and Qaeda targets, and provide information about developing terrorist cells, the U.S. government is more likely to cooperate with them, officials said.",
      "The extent of that cooperation may also depend on whether Mr. Biden finds any support for that approach on Capitol Hill.",
      "Mr. Biden has received withering criticism from top Democrats, who have pledged to use their committee gavels to seek a full accounting of what went wrong. Republicans, meanwhile, have struggled to find a coherent criticism.",
      "In the House, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader, ridiculed Mr. Biden on Friday as \u201ca picture of weakness and incompetence.\u201d But that criticism came after a dizzying series of contradictory statements, including his assertions that the United States should have no troops in Afghanistan but should have held onto Bagram Air Base \u2014 which would have required more troops.",
      "Asked whether Mr. Biden and his team are frustrated by the need to rely on the Taliban, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said Friday that the administration was focused on finishing its mission.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just not a lot of time for self-reflection right now,\u201d she said."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 At least 1,500 American citizens remain in Afghanistan with just days left before the scheduled U.S. withdrawal from the country, but officials on Wednesday acknowledged the reality that tens of thousands of Afghan allies and others at high risk of Taliban reprisals would be left behind.",
      "The sound of gunfire, and clouds of tear gas and black smoke, filled the air around the international airport in Kabul, the capital, as thousands of Afghans massed at the gates on Wednesday, desperate to escape ahead of the American military\u2019s final departure on Aug. 31, after 20 years of war.",
      "The U.S. Embassy warned Americans later in the day to stay away from the airport and told anyone outside the perimeter to \u201cleave immediately.\u201d The British and Australian governments issued similar warnings.",
      "A senior U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe confidential assessments, confirmed that the United States was tracking a \u201cspecific\u201d and \u201ccredible\u201d threat at the airport from the Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan, which has carried out dozens of attacks in recent years and is a rival of the Taliban.",
      "As military and government charter flights took off every 45 minutes as part of an airlift, Biden administration officials said they had evacuated about 82,300 people since Aug. 14, the day before Kabul fell to the Taliban. Around 4,500 of them were American citizens, with 500 more expected to depart soon.",
      "But Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said the government was trying to track down around 1,000 American citizens still believed to be in Afghanistan who had not responded to a frantic flurry of emails, phone calls or other messages offering to evacuate them.",
      "\u201cIn this critical stretch, we\u2019re focused on getting Americans and their families onto planes, out of Afghanistan, as quickly as possible,\u201d Mr. Blinken said at the State Department.",
      "He also sought to assure Afghans who had worked with the U.S. military or embassy, and potentially hundreds of thousands of people who challenged the Taliban\u2019s extremist ideology, that \u201cthey will not be forgotten.\u201d",
      "Likening images and reports of Afghans being trampled at the Kabul airport in the crush to evacuate to \u201cgetting punched in the gut,\u201d Mr. Blinken said it would be incumbent on the Taliban to guarantee their safe passage.",
      "He signaled that such an arrangement could be reached with a mix of economic and diplomatic pressure, and the lure of international aid, but he would not discuss his level of confidence in the Taliban to keep their word beyond vaguely citing what he called their public and private commitments to allow people to leave.",
      "\u201cLet me be crystal clear about this: There is no deadline on our work to help any remaining American citizens who decide they want to leave to do so, along with the many Afghans who have stood by us over these many years, and want to leave, and have been unable to do so,\u201d Mr. Blinken said. \u201cThat effort will continue every day past Aug. 31.\u201d",
      "A Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said on Wednesday that Afghans with valid travel documents would not be prevented from entering the airport if they were allowed in by American and Afghan forces there.",
      "In his first sit-down interview with a Western media organization since the Taliban\u2019s arrival in Kabul, Mr. Mujahid disputed reports that the group would begin to keep Afghans away from the airport, which had been based on his statements during a news conference a day earlier.",
      "\u201cWe said that people who don\u2019t have proper documents aren\u2019t allowed to go,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need passports and visas for the countries they\u2019re going to, and then they can leave by air. If their documents are valid, then we\u2019re not going to ask what they were doing before.\u201d",
      "He also insisted that the Taliban would forgive those who fought against them, and that women would be allowed to attend school and work, within what he described as Islamic principles. Human rights officials have dismissed such assurances as disingenuous, and many Afghans have hidden in their homes, fearing harassment and violence.",
      "Mr. Mujahid acknowledged that women would need a male guardian on journeys of three days or longer. He said that rumors that the Taliban would force women to stay in their homes or cover their faces were baseless, but he confirmed that music would not be allowed in public.",
      "\u201cMusic is forbidden in Islam,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we\u2019re hoping that we can persuade people not to do such things.\u201d",
      "White House officials said on Wednesday that 90 U.S. and allied planes had flown out an estimated 19,200 people in a 24-hour period.",
      "At least 500 were American citizens and their families, Mr. Blinken said, joining Afghans who were employees of the now-shuttered U.S. Embassy in Kabul and others who had worked for the American military and other government agencies, some since 2001, who qualify for a special immigration visa to live in the United States.",
      "Congressional officials said earlier this week that the Biden administration had identified an estimated 50,000 Afghans who were eligible for the special visa. Former security forces, government officials and people who advocated women\u2019s rights, the rule of law and other pillars of democracy also have been evacuated.",
      "A new estimate from the Association of Wartime Allies released on Wednesday concluded that at least 250,000 Afghans \u2014 and perhaps more than a million \u2014 could be eligible for expedited immigration status. The advocacy group worked with American University to analyze employment contracts and other documents that those Afghans would need to prove their eligibility.",
      "Mr. Blinken could not offer a more precise number, and noted the difficulty that even tracking down how many Americans might be in Afghanistan had been a challenge for the U.S. government.",
      "He said the State Department had identified at least 6,000 Americans \u2014 many of them with dual Afghan citizenship \u2014 by searching various databases. Officials have sent more than 20,000 emails and placed 45,000 phone calls across Afghanistan to offer U.S. citizens a chance to leave, he said.",
      "Thousands more American citizens may live in Afghanistan, but had not registered with the U.S. Embassy and otherwise could not be found, a senior State Department official later acknowledged.",
      "Hours before Mr. Blinken spoke, lawmakers in Congress urged the Biden administration to extend the Aug. 31 deadline to ensure that all Americans and Afghan allies could leave Afghanistan safely.",
      "\u201cThe reporting I\u2019m getting on the ground are that our American citizens are trying to get out,\u201d said Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \u201cOur Afghan partners and interpreters who served with our special forces, put their life on the line. We have a moral obligation to save them.\u201d",
      "Mr. Blinken would not discuss whether any semblance of the U.S. Embassy in Kabul \u2014 once one of the largest American diplomatic missions in the world \u2014 would remain open after the military exits next week. A small group of U.S. diplomats remain in Afghanistan, on a secure base at the airport in Kabul, to oversee the evacuation and continue negotiations with the Taliban.",
      "As the evacuation mission played out, world leaders \u2014 and millions of Afghans \u2014 waited with anxiety to discern the true shape of Taliban rule.",
      "During the group\u2019s last turn in power, Afghan women risked being beaten, tortured or executed if they left their homes. In the two decades since American-led forces ousted the militants from power, many young women have come to expect basic rights.",
      "In the first days after the Taliban seized Kabul, and national power, on Aug. 15, Afghan protesters have demanded that the militants accept their demands for greater freedom. Among the protests was a march by women demanding that their right to education and jobs not be harmed.",
      "One activist, named Fariha, said she had taken part in the demonstration last week \u201cto show the Taliban that they have to change, because we will not.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe cannot breathe if we are deprived of our rights to education and work, and if we are not present in the society,\u201d she said through sobs.",
      "\u201cThere are women who haven\u2019t gone to Europe or the U.S. \u2014 they have stayed and are ready to fight until death,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have worked hard for 20 years to gain education and work. We will not let anyone ignore us.\u201d",
      "Despite Taliban efforts to reassure Afghans of their safety, ominous signs suggest that they have not abandoned their brutal tactics. On Tuesday, the United Nations\u2019 top human rights official cited \u201charrowing and credible\u201d reports that the Taliban had executed civilians and noncombatant soldiers.",
      "With the future of international aid to Afghanistan unclear, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said on Wednesday that her country would maintain its support for the Afghan people after the U.S. troop withdrawal. She also called for talks with the Taliban.",
      "\u201cOur goal must be to preserve as much as possible what we have achieved in terms of changes in Afghanistan in the last 20 years,\u201d Ms. Merkel told a session of Parliament convened to discuss the Taliban\u2019s rapid takeover of Afghanistan. \u201cThis is something the international community must talk about with the Taliban.\u201d",
      "Germany pulled its last contingent of about 570 troops out of Afghanistan in June, but several hundred Germans were still engaged in development work funded by their government.",
      "Adding to the concerns about Afghanistan is its foundering economy, which had been propped up for the past generation by American aid, but is now in free fall. Banks are closed. Cash is growing scarce, and food prices are rising. Fuel is becoming harder to find. Government services have stalled as civil servants avoid work, fearing retribution.",
      "People trying to flee, if they make it past Taliban checkpoints, have been met with chaotic scenes at Kabul\u2019s airport. At least seven Afghan civilians, including a toddler, have been trampled to death.",
      "On Wednesday, the Taliban brought what looked like about 200 people to a fenced-off area, where they were crammed together under a beating afternoon sun.",
      "John F. Kirby, the chief Pentagon spokesman, told reporters on Wednesday that American officers in Kabul, including Rear Adm. Peter G. Vasely, the top commander, and Maj. Gen. Christopher Donahue, the head of the 82nd Airborne Division, were talking to their Taliban counterparts every day to ensure safe passage of Americans and Afghan allies with proper credentials to flights leaving Kabul.",
      "Mr. Kirby said that the Pentagon would prioritize the evacuation of American troops and equipment in the mission\u2019s final days. About 5,400 American troops are now at the airport after 400 troops not essential to the evacuation left the country in recent days, he said.",
      "Still, there have been numerous reports of Afghans with proper paperwork being turned away at Taliban checkpoints and even at the airport gates, where some 30 U.S. consular officials and Marines are checking credentials. Throughout the past week, many gates have closed intermittently to clear backlogs."

      "SINGAPORE \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris sought to fortify the image of the United States as a credible ally by offering a sharp rebuke of China during an address on Tuesday in Southeast Asia. Her effort comes as the White House faces growing questions about its reliability as an international partner amid continuing violence in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.",
      "\u201cIn the South China Sea, we know that Beijing continues to coerce, to intimidate and to make claims to the vast majority of the South China Sea,\u201d Ms. Harris said in Singapore. She added that China\u2019s \u201cunlawful claims\u201d had continued \u201cto undermine the rules-based order and threaten the sovereignty of nations.\u201d",
      "The White House is aiming to refocus U.S. foreign policy strategy on competing with China\u2019s rising economic influence rather than on continuing to fight \u201cforever wars,\u201d such as the two-decade long conflict in Afghanistan. The chaotic effort to evacuate Americans and Afghan allies from Kabul has overshadowed the vice president\u2019s trip, which began on Sunday in Singapore and took her to Vietnam on Tuesday.",
      "Ms. Harris\u2019s overseas trip, her second as vice president, gained heightened urgency in the days before she boarded Air Force Two. The journey had been seen as a chance to bolster economic and security ties with key partners in Singapore and Vietnam, a crucial piece of President Biden\u2019s strategy in the South China Sea. But in the wake of the haphazard withdrawal from Afghanistan, her trip became the administration\u2019s first test of the White House efforts to reassure the world that it can still be a trusted international partner.",
      "For Ms. Harris, that has meant reassuring nations in the South China Sea of the administration\u2019s credibility while confronting questions about whether the United States had abandoned its allies in Afghanistan.",
      "That pressure is likely to increase when Ms. Harris has a series of meetings in Hanoi on Wednesday and Thursday. Her senior aides have faced questions about the historical parallel between the U.S. evacuation of American citizens in 1975 from Saigon and the situation in Kabul \u2014 replete with scenes of desperate Afghans running behind U.S. military planes, and of American citizens, Afghan allies and their relatives crowded into the Kabul airport and stuck in limbo.",
      "Even the vice president\u2019s travel to Vietnam from Singapore faced challenges.",
      "Her trip to Hanoi was delayed on Tuesday night for more than three hours because of a report of a possible \u201canomalous health incident,\u201d the term the Biden administration uses to refer to cases of so-called Havana syndrome attacks, the unexplained headaches, dizziness and memory loss reported by scores of State Department officials, C.I.A. officers and their families.",
      "Ms. Harris\u2019s spokeswoman said she was healthy and would proceed with meetings in Hanoi.",
      "And in Singapore, Ms. Harris pressed on with her message.",
      "\u201cI am standing here because of our commitment to a longstanding relationship, which is an enduring relationship, with the Indo-Pacific region, with Southeast Asian countries and, in particular, with Singapore,\u201d the vice president said a day earlier alongside Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore during a news conference dominated by questions about Afghanistan. She said that the administration was \u201csingularly focused\u201d on evacuating Americans and Afghan allies from the country.",
      "In a sign of how vast a shadow the situation in Afghanistan had cast over the trip, even Mr. Lee was asked by one of the two local reporters about the U.S. withdrawal.",
      "\u201cWe hope Afghanistan does not become an epicenter for terrorism again,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cAnd post-Afghanistan in the longer term, what matters is how the U.S. repositions itself in the Asia Pacific, engages the broader region and continues the fight against terrorism.\u201d",
      "Ms. Harris\u2019s presence was described by experts as a welcoming sign of renewed focus by the Biden administration in the South China Sea after several Southeast Asian officials in recent months became frustrated over the lack of face-to-face engagement from the United States.",
      "The vice president\u2019s visit came just weeks after the U.S. defense secretary, Lloyd J. Austin, traveled to Singapore, the anchor of the U.S. naval presence in the region, to reassure Southeast Asian nations of the administration\u2019s investment. China has taken advantage of the United States\u2019 absence by courting nations with visits, loans and coronavirus vaccines.",
      "At a news briefing on Tuesday, Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, said, \u201cWhat is happening in Afghanistan now clearly tells people what rules are touted by the United States and what is the so-called order of the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe United States always tries to use rules and order to justify its selfishness and bullying,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cBut now how many people will believe it?\u201d",
      "The U.S. administration has tried to strike a balance in the region by countering China\u2019s investment while not forcing the nations to take sides between the two powers. In a nod to Singapore\u2019s efforts to stay neutral in the rising tension between Beijing and Washington, Ms. Harris stressed on Tuesday the United States was not trying to \u201cmake anyone choose between countries.\u201d",
      "The South China Sea is a major flash point between Beijing and several Southeast Asian countries. Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam have all accused China of building and fortifying artificial islands in the area and sending vessels to intimidate their militaries and those who fish.",
      "After Ms. Harris met with Mr. Lee in a closed-door meeting on Monday at the Istana, the presidential palace of Singapore, the vice president\u2019s office announced a series of agreements to address climate change, cybersecurity and the pandemic. The two nations also agreed to increase information sharing on cybersecurity threats to financial markets, cooperate on identifying coronavirus variants and convene industry executives to address supply-chain issues, including a global shortage of semiconductors that are used to build cars and computers that has been a point of concern for the Biden administration.",
      "Curtis S. Chin, the former United States ambassador to the Asian Development Bank from 2007 to 2011, said those commitments only went so far.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s, of course, an important symbolic trip, but the reality is that what\u2019s more important than these trips is what happens in between,\u201d Mr. Chin said. \u201cThat\u2019s why to me what happened in Afghanistan is so important because the reality of U.S. behavior undercuts the rhetoric of U.S. behavior.\u201d",
      "Mr. Chin added, \u201cOur rhetoric is: \u2018We are here for a long time. We are steadfast in our engagement.\u2019 The reality is, as Asia well knows from Vietnam to Afghanistan, that rhetoric and reality often do not match.\u201d",
      "Ms. Harris stumbled on rhetoric alone during her first overseas trip, to Guatemala and Mexico, which had been meant to address the factors pushing migrants to flee to the United States, but was instead marred by domestic politics. Her efforts to defend institutions in Central America that aim to root out corruption \u2014 one factor pushing vulnerable families to migrate to the United States in record-high numbers \u2014 was overshadowed by her fumbled answers on whether she would visit the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never been to Europe,\u201d Ms. Harris told the NBC anchor Lester Holt. \u201cI don\u2019t understand the point you\u2019re making.\u201d",
      "David Axelrod, a former top adviser to former President Barack Obama, said Ms. Harris faced heightened criticism because she was a clear candidate in the next presidential election.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s relatively new, doesn\u2019t have that experience, so she\u2019s going to be watched closely on these trips,\u201d Mr. Axelrod said of her foreign policy record. \u201cAnd the Afghanistan situation just added to her burden.\u201d",
      "But the trip to Southeast Asia also presented Ms. Harris with an opportunity to address an issue at the center of rare political consensus in Washington, according to Aaron Connelly, a research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Singapore.",
      "\u201cIn contrast to Central America, this is a region of opportunities and strategic opportunities,\u201d said Mr. Connelly. \u201cThere\u2019s broad political agreement in the United States to address the rise of China, and this is where you would do that.\u201d"

    "content": [
      "KABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Two explosions killed dozens of people, including at least 13 U.S. troops, ripping through the crowds outside Afghanistan\u2019s main airport on Thursday, just hours after Western governments had warned of an imminent Islamic State attack and told their people to stay away from the airport.",
      "The attack, by at least two suicide bombers, struck at the only avenue of escape for the thousands of foreign nationals and tens \u2014 or hundreds \u2014 of thousands of their Afghan allies who are trying to flee the country following the Taliban takeover and ahead of the final withdrawal of U.S. troops, set for next Tuesday.",
      "Afghan health officials gave varying estimates of the toll at the international airport in Kabul, the capital \u2014 from at least 30 dead to more than 60, and from 120 wounded to 140 \u2014 while a Taliban spokesman cited at least 13 civilians killed and 60 wounded.",
      "For American forces, the attacks were a gruesome coda to almost 20 years of warfare in Afghanistan \u2014 one of their heaviest losses, just days before they are set to leave the country. In addition to 13 service members killed, 15 were wounded, the Pentagon said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re outraged as well as heartbroken,\u201d President Biden said in an address from the White House.",
      "\u201cTo those who carried out this attack, as well as anyone who wishes America harm, know this,\u201d he said to the attackers. \u201cWe will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay. I will defend our interests and our people with every measure at my command.\u201d",
      "Bystanders hoping to find survivors picked their way among torn and bloodied bodies that littered the ground outside one of the airport\u2019s main gates, or waded into a drainage canal where other bodies bobbed in the water.",
      "\u201cI saw bodies of women, children and men scattered all around after the blast,\u201d said one Afghan witness, who requested anonymity because he feared for his safety. He said he and other civilians, along with Taliban fighters, fled after the first explosion, because there were rumors that the Islamic State \u201chad sent four suicide bombers,\u201d and he feared more detonations.",
      "The bombings hint at a new round of violence that may lie in store for a people and a country that have suffered more than 40 years of warfare, as the Taliban militants\u2019 new rule is being challenged by still more extreme groups like the Islamic State Khorasan, the terrorist branch known as ISIS-K.",
      "The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks on behalf of its loyalists in Afghanistan.",
      "Intelligence has revealed other \u201cvery, very real\u201d terrorist threats to the airport, Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., commander of U.S. Central Command, told a press briefing, including plans for rocket attacks and a vehicle bombing.",
      "But President Biden and other U.S. officials insisted that the carnage and continued danger would not halt the American-led airlift that, after a belated and rocky start, has ferried more than 100,000 people out of Afghanistan in the last two weeks. Many of those were Afghans who had worked with NATO forces and their families, and who feared Taliban reprisals and hoped to start new lives in other parts of the world.",
      "\u201cWe will not be dissuaded from the task at hand,\u201d Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III said in a statement. \u201cTo do anything less \u2014 especially now \u2014 would dishonor the purpose and sacrifice these men and women have rendered our country and the people of Afghanistan.\u201d",
      "A few hours after the explosions, \u201cwe are continuing to bring people onto the airport,\u201d General McKenzie told reporters at the Pentagon from his headquarters in Tampa, Fla. \u201cThe plan is designed to operate under stress.\u201d",
      "Mr. Biden has said repeatedly that he wanted to end the long U.S. involvement in Afghanistan precisely to avoid such American casualties. Some NATO allies and humanitarian groups have called on him to delay the final military withdrawal, but the president said the attacks on Thursday reinforce \u201cwhy I\u2019ve been so determined to limit the duration of this mission.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese American service members who gave their lives,\u201d Mr. Biden said, were \u201cheroes who have been engaged in a dangerous, selfless mission to save the lives of others.\u201d",
      "Most of the bombing victims were Afghan civilians, including families with small children, who had thronged the airport hoping to get precious space on one of the departing military transports. One blast detonated at the Abbey Gate on the southeast perimeter of the airport, and the other near the Baron Hotel a few hundred feet away.",
      "Mohammad Shah, an Afghan witness, said he had gone to the airport to accompany a friend who had flown in from France recently to get married and was ready to leave. He said he waited at a distance while the friend tried to make his way through the crowd to the airport gate, went looking for him, to no avail, and then heard the first explosion.",
      "\u201cI recognized him from his sandals,\u201d Mr. Shah said of his friend\u2019s body, which he said he took to the man\u2019s parents. \u201cThe canal was full of bodies, dozens of bodies were on the ground, the situation was very very bad in the area.\u201d",
      "At the Emergency Hospital, under the glare of floodlights and the eyes of an anxious crowd, ambulance after ambulance arrived bringing injured people from the airport, some of them children. Zargoona, a journalist and former government worker, wept as she described how she had received a call from a taxi driver informing her that her wounded husband was inside.",
      "\u201cI begged him not to go, but he went this morning with his government I.D. card to try to show the foreigners,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have four children, what will happen to us now?\u201d",
      "At Wazir Akbar Khan hospital, a doctor said there were 27 dead and 57 wounded transported from the airport \u2014 and no space left in the morgue.",
      "General McKenzie said it appeared that a suicide bomber, most likely wearing a concealed explosives vest, had made it through the checkpoints outside the airport, many of them run by Taliban soldiers, who are supposed to detect such attackers. He said he had no reason to believe that the Taliban, who are eager for the Americans to leave as quickly as possible, knowingly let the bomber through.",
      "The chief Taliban spokesman, however, made a point of saying that the attack took place in an area where American forces controlled security.",
      "The explosion hit at the airport gate, where U.S. troops screen people who are trying to get in. Gunfire followed, but it was not clear who was shooting. The general said American forces will work with the Taliban to keep crowds farther back from the airport gates, and to close some roads to thwart vehicle attacks.",
      "\u201cThis is close-up war \u2014 the breath of the person you are searching is upon you,\u201d General McKenzie said, adding, \u201cI cannot tell you how impressed I am with the heroism\u201d of the service members doing that perilous work.",
      "\u201cIf we can find who\u2019s associated with this, we will go after them,\u201d he said.",
      "Mr. Biden vowed, \u201cwe will respond with force and precision at our time\u201d against the Islamic State leaders who ordered the attack. He added, \u201cWe have some reason to believe we know who they are.\u201d",
      "U.S. Marines at Abbey Gate had been working tirelessly for days, well aware that their time to help Afghans and U.S. citizens flee the country was running short as the Aug. 31 withdrawal date drew near. Ten of them were among the dead.",
      "The State Department had identified about 6,000 Americans who were in Afghanistan on Aug. 14, the day before the Taliban began entering Kabul and the U.S.-backed president, Ashraf Ghani, fled the country. On Wednesday, the department said that figure was down to 1,500 and it was trying frantically to reach them all, telling them to get to the airport or sending helicopters to extract them.",
      "But then the intelligence on an impending attack prompted the United States and NATO allies to tell people overnight not to approach the airport. Even so, by Thursday afternoon, the State Department said, about 500 more Americans had left the country, and hundreds more were awaiting evacuation, while some U.S. citizens had signaled that they do not intend to leave.",
      "Early Friday morning, alarmed Kabul residents reported another series of explosions near the airport, setting off fears of another bombing attack. Taliban officials and Afghan journalists soon reported otherwise: It was the Americans, they said, destroying their own equipment as they prepared to leave Afghanistan."

      "Current and former U.S. officials and activists described the desperate steps Afghan women have taken since the Taliban\u2019s takeover of their country this week as a grim reminder of the heightened threat they face because of their gender.",
      "Any attempt to contact American or international refugee agencies is a risk that most Afghan women are not willing to take, the officials and activists said. Even going to the airport in Kabul, to try to secure a place on an American or international flight overflowing with anguished Afghans, has become a life-or-death decision.",
      "\u201cThe most dangerous place in Afghanistan right now is the Kabul airport,\u201d Rina Amiri, a former official at the State Department and United Nations, said on Tuesday. She recounted stories of women and their families being caught between volleys of gunfire, or beaten by Taliban supporters, as they tried but failed to find a plane that would fly them out.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just damning that the United States and the international community have put these women in the position of having to risk not only their lives, but that of their children and families, in order to leave and save themselves and their families,\u201d Ms. Amiri said.",
      "Afghan men make up most of the interpreters and cultural officers who have worked for the United States over the 20-year war and, in turn, have been granted special access to immigrate. That is one reason relatively few women have been among the thousands of people who have been evacuated from Afghanistan over the past month \u2014 including more than 4,800 as of Wednesday morning since the Taliban\u2019s takeover of the government in Kabul. Tens of thousands of visa applicants remain stranded across the country.",
      "The Biden administration in recent weeks has expanded immigration and refugee resettlement programs to allow more Afghans \u2014 including women \u2014 into the United States. Wendy R. Sherman, the deputy secretary of state, said on Wednesday that the administration would use every economic, political and diplomatic tool available to ensure the rights of women who will remain in Afghanistan under Taliban rule.",
      "\u201cThis is personal for me,\u201d said Ms. Sherman, recounting meeting with Afghan women in a refugee camp in 1997. \u201cThat memory will never be wiped from my mind. Societies could not flourish and prosper without the full participation of women and girls back then, and they cannot flourish and prosper, without women and girls now.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, the United States joined 20 countries and the European Union in demanding that the rights of Afghan women be protected, and pledging to send humanitarian aid and other support \u201cto ensure that their voices can be heard.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are deeply worried about Afghan women and girls, their rights to education, work and freedom of movement,\u201d the countries said in a joint statement released by the State Department.",
      "But leading lawmakers in Congress said that was not enough to secure even a limited number of women \u2014 politicians, human rights activists, journalists, soldiers and defenders of democracy \u2014 who could be at the top of the list of Taliban targets.",
      "This week, most Democrats and two Republicans in the Senate urged Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and the homeland security secretary, Alejandro N. Mayorkas, to rush Afghan women who are at high risk to the United States under a temporary status, and deal with the paperwork after they were out of danger.",
      "\u201cWe and our staff are receiving regular reports regarding the targeting, threatening, kidnapping, torturing and assassinations of women for their work,\u201d the senators wrote in a letter on Monday.",
      "They added, \u201cWe must also protect those women who might fall through the cracks of the U.S. government\u2019s response.\u201d",
      "In remarks on Monday, Mr. Biden said the United States would \u201ccontinue to speak out for the basic rights of the Afghan people \u2014 of women and girls \u2014 just as we speak out all over the world.\u201d",
      "Taliban leaders have portrayed their group as more socially evolved than it was 20 years ago, when extremists beat women without warning, required them to wear head-to-toe burqas, limited their public outings, refused to let them work and prevented girls from attending school.",
      "\u201cWe assure that there will be no violence against women,\u201d the Taliban\u2019s chief spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, told journalists on Tuesday. He promised that \u201cno prejudice against women will be allowed,\u201d and said that they could participate in society \u2014 \u201cwithin the bounds of Islamic law.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration has warned the Taliban that Afghanistan will not receive financial support if the group reverts to its extremist roots, including by oppressing women. On Monday, the U.N. Security Council made clear that for the Taliban to be considered a legitimate government \u2014 and receive aid \u2014 it must not only reject support and safe haven for terrorist organizations and allow humanitarian access into Afghanistan, but also protect human rights, specifically for women and girls.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. needs to be careful in terms of the recognition that it gives to the Taliban,\u201d said Lisa Curtis, who oversaw policy for Afghanistan and elsewhere in Central and South Asia on the National Security Council during the Trump administration. \u201cWe need to see concrete examples that they\u2019re going to provide human rights, they\u2019re going to maintain women\u2019s rights.\u201d",

      "Just two months ago, the U.S. Agency for International Development announced it would send $266 million in aid to help Afghans struggling with food and clothing shortages caused by conflict. That brought the aid agency\u2019s total funding to Afghanistan to nearly $3.9 billion since 2002, most of it funneled through relief agencies.",
      "Much of that money has paid for educating Afghan women, training them for jobs and making sure they have better access to maternal, pediatric and other health care. One U.S.-funded program, known as Promote, prepared nearly 24,000 women who were once housebound to join the country\u2019s work force and sharpened the negotiation skills of 5,000 so that they could press for gender equity \u2014 including in the peace process with the Taliban that is now defunct.",

    "title": "ISIS Poses \u2018Acute\u2019 Threat to U.S. Evacuation Efforts in Kabul, Sullivan Says",
    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Biden\u2019s national security adviser warned on Sunday that the threat of a terrorist attack by the Islamic State posed a serious danger to the administration\u2019s evacuation of thousands of Americans and Afghan allies from the international airport in Kabul.",
      "\u201cThe threat is real. It is acute. It is persistent. And it is something that we are focused on with every tool in our arsenal,\u201d Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d",
      "His comments were the most urgent so far regarding a range of steadily increasing threats that intelligence and military officials have privately briefed Mr. Biden and his top aides on in recent days, officials said.",
      "Neither Mr. Sullivan nor other senior American military or intelligence officials provided details about the threats or their specificity. Current and former officials say, however, that they range from a missile attack against a transport plane taking off or landing at Hamid Karzai International Airport to a bomb-laden truck or suicide bombers infiltrating the crowd outside the airport.",
      "Mr. Biden said on Friday that U.S. military and counterterrorism officials were closely watching for threatened ISIS attacks, noting that thousands of prisoners had been released in Kabul and other locations. While the Taliban is unlikely to have consciously let out the Islamic State fighters, the chaos in Afghanistan in recent weeks allowed all manner of prisoners to be freed from custody, including the Taliban\u2019s enemies.",
      "\u201cISIS-K has been waiting for an opportunity like this, where its fighters can exploit the chaos of the situation on the ground for a chance to kill American soldiers,\u201d said Colin P. Clarke, a counterterrorism analyst at the Soufan Group, a New York-based security consulting firm, referring to the Islamic State\u2019s Khorasan affiliate in Afghanistan.",
      "U.N. counterterrorism officials said in June that ISIS had carried out 77 attacks in Afghanistan in the first four months of this year, up from 21 in the same period in 2020. The attacks last year included a strike against Kabul University in November and a rocket barrage against the airport in Kabul a month later. Some analysts say the group also has links to the Haqqani network, another militant organization.",
      "For the past week, U.S. officials have warned about threats against the airport and American operations to evacuate civilians from Kabul. By Friday, officials said, the threat reporting was growing more acute.",
      "An attack on the airport, current and former officials said, would be a strategic blow against both the United States and the Taliban, who are trying to demonstrate that they can control the country.",
      "The Taliban have fought ISIS in recent years, and leaders of the Islamic State in Afghanistan denounced the Taliban takeover of the country, criticizing their version of Islamic rule as insufficiently hard-line.",
      "Mr. Sullivan said that American commanders on the ground were using \u201ca wide variety of capabilities\u201d to defend the airfield against an attack, and were working closely with spy agencies to identify and defeat any threats. He did not provide details.",
      "\u201cIt is something that we are placing paramount priority on stopping or disrupting,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said. \u201cAnd we will do everything that we can for as long as we are on the ground to keep that from happening. But we are taking it absolutely deadly seriously.\u201d",
      "Indeed, American officials said on Saturday that the U.S. military was establishing alternative routes to the Kabul airport for Americans, Afghan allies and citizens from other Western nations because of the threat ISIS posed to the airfield and its surroundings, a development previously reported by CNN.",
      "On Thursday night, CH-47 Chinook helicopters picked up 169 Americans at a hotel meeting place and whisked them to safety, rather than having them walk 200 yards to an airport gate where a large, unruly crowd had gathered.",
      "American and Western cargo planes taking off from the airport have dispensed flares and chaff, a common precautionary practice in conflict zones like Afghanistan and Iraq to fool heat-seeking missiles fired from the ground, military officials said.",
      "U.S. military officials in Kabul who are communicating with senior Taliban leaders to provide safe passage to the airport for Americans and Afghan allies are also in this rare instance of cooperating to thwart a common enemy: ISIS.",
      "A deadly attack against American and Afghan civilians would be a disaster not only for the United States, but also for the Taliban, who are moving to consolidate control over Kabul. The Taliban and the Islamic State have been enemies, fighting each other on the battlefield for control of parts of the country.",
      "Western counterterrorism analysts say a high-profile attack by ISIS during the evacuation would most likely lift the group\u2019s flagging fortunes, recruiting and prestige.",
      "A United Nations report in June assessed that the Islamic State\u2019s \u201cterritorial losses have affected the group\u2019s ability to recruit and generate new funding.\u201d",
      "Although the ISIS affiliate was still believed to have 1,500 to 2,200 fighters in small areas of Kunar and Nangarhar provinces, the report said, \u201cit has been forced to decentralize and consists primarily of cells and small groups across the country, acting in an autonomous manner while sharing the same ideology.\u201d",
      "While the group suffered military setbacks starting in summer 2018, the report concluded that since June 2020, under its ambitious new leader, Shahab al-Muhajir, the affiliate \u201cremains active and dangerous,\u201d and is seeking to swell its ranks with disaffected Taliban fighters and other militants.",
      "\u201cGiven that ISIS-K and the Taliban are enemies, it will be a challenge for ISIS-K,\u201d Mr. Clarke said. \u201cNevertheless, the Taliban now has its hands full with governing, which will consume considerable bandwidth within the organization.\u201d",
      "Nathan Sales, the State Department\u2019s counterterrorism coordinator in the Trump administration, said on Sunday that if the ISIS affiliate was capable of attacking the airport in Kabul, \u201cthat suggests Afghanistan after the U.S. withdrawal will be a permissive environment for all sorts of terrorist groups, even those hostile to the Taliban.\u201d",
      "Defense Department officials have been tight-lipped about the threats and what they are doing to defeat them, citing operational security.",
      "John F. Kirby, the chief Pentagon spokesman, declined on Saturday to comment on any specific threat information, but he acknowledged that the security situation at the airport was extremely volatile.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to get into specific threat assessments,\u201d Mr. Kirby said. \u201cThe situation in Kabul, in the whole city, is fluid and dynamic. And it changes. It changes almost by the hour, and it changes in locations around the airport. It\u2019s very, very fluid and dynamic.\u201d"

    "title": "U.S. Revives Facebook Suit, Adding Details to Back Claim of a Monopoly",
    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Trade Commission took new aim at Facebook on Thursday, beefing up its accusations that the company was a monopoly that illegally crushed competition, in an attempt to overcome the skepticism of a federal judge who threw out the agency\u2019s original case two months ago.",
      "The suit submitted Thursday contains the same overall arguments as the original, saying that Facebook\u2019s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were made to create a \u201cmoat\u201d around its monopoly in social networking and arguing that the social network should be broken up. But the updated suit is nearly twice as long and includes more facts and analysis that the agency says better support the government\u2019s allegations.",
      "\u201cFacebook lacked the business acumen and technical talent to survive the transition to mobile,\u201d Holly Vedova, the acting director of the bureau of competition at the agency, said in a statement. \u201cAfter failing to compete with new innovators, Facebook illegally bought or buried them when their popularity became an existential threat.\u201d",
      "Facebook responded: \u201cThere was no valid claim that Facebook was a monopolist \u2014 and that has not changed. Our acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were reviewed and cleared many years ago, and our platform policies were lawful.\u201d",
      "The agency had to refile the case after the judge overseeing it said in June that the government had not provided enough evidence that Facebook was a monopoly in social networking. The judge\u2019s decision, and a similar one he made in a case against the company brought by more than 40 states, dealt a stunning blow to regulators\u2019 attempts to rein in Big Tech.",
      "His decision presented the first major test for Lina Khan, the F.T.C. chair, who was only days into her role at the time. Ms. Khan represents a wave of new thinking about the industry among administration officials and many lawmakers, arguing that the government needs to take far more aggressive action to stem the power of technology giants like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. President Biden has appointed multiple regulators with similar aims and lawmakers proposed updates to antitrust laws to target the power of technology companies.",
      "The criticisms of the first version of the Facebook case levied by the judge, James E. Boasberg of the District Court of the District of Columbia, showed the steep challenges regulators face. Although the companies dominate the markets they are in \u2014 social media, in the case of Facebook \u2014 the courts often look at whether prices are rising as an indication of monopolization. Facebook\u2019s most popular services are free.",
      "\u201cNo one who hears the title of the 2010 film \u2018The Social Network\u2019 wonders which company it is about,\u201d Judge Boasberg wrote. \u201cYet, whatever it may mean to the public, \u2018monopoly power\u2019 is a term of art under federal law with a precise economic meaning.\u201d He instructed the F.T.C. to back up claims that Facebook controlled 60 percent of the market for \u201cpersonal social networking\u201d and that it blocked competition.",
      "Ms. Khan then faced a choice on how to handle Judge Boasberg\u2019s decision. One option was to drop the case entirely, while another was to expand it with even broader accusations. Instead, she took more of a middle ground, resubmitting the suit with greater detail and a more sweeping narrative of the company and what the agency says is a pattern of anticompetitive behavior since Mark Zuckerberg co-founded it at Harvard in 2004.",
      "The revised suit was approved by the commission in a 3-2 vote, with the three Democrats on the commission voting in favor of it and the two Republican members dissenting.",
      "In the new complaint, the F.T.C. provides more details to support the government\u2019s claims that Facebook holds a monopoly in social networking. But the public version of the suit had many of the statistics redacted because the numbers are proprietary.",
      "The agency said that Facebook \u2014 the company\u2019s biggest service, known inside the company as Facebook Blue \u2014 and Instagram were the leading social networks in the U.S., far ahead of its next biggest competitor, Snapchat.",
      "The agency refuted Facebook\u2019s claims that it has many competitors in social networking, instant messaging and entertainment. The agency argued that Facebook\u2019s products were for \u201cpersonal social networking,\u201d distinguishing them from specialized social networks like the professional network LinkedIn or the neighborhood site NextDoor. The F.T.C. added that Facebook\u2019s products also were different from messaging services like Signal and iMessage because users don\u2019t typically use those services to send notes to big groups, nor do they use those services to find contacts.",
      "And the agency said Facebook differed from Twitter, YouTube and TikTok because content on those sites were typically created for the public and not directed at specific individuals in a social network.",
      "\u201cFacebook has today, and has maintained since 2011, a dominant share of the relevant market for U.S. personal social networking services, as measured using multiple metrics: time spent, daily active users, and monthly active users,\u201d the agency said in its complaint.",
      "The F.T.C.\u2019s core argument is that Facebook tried to maintain a monopoly over social networking through its acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. Slow to develop its app for mobile phones, the company sought to \u201cbuy or bury innovators threatening to out-compete Facebook in the new mobile environment,\u201d the agency said in its complaint.",
      "The lawsuit also says that, beginning in 2010, the company stifled competitors like Circle, a social network, and Vine, a short-video platform, by adding new limits for how outside developers whose products connected to Facebook could work with other social networks.",
      "\u201cFacebook beat competitors not by improving its own product but instead by imposing anticompetitive restrictions on developers,\u201d according to the lawsuit.",
      "Facebook has criticized the arguments as revisionist history, noting that the F.T.C. reviewed the mergers with Instagram and WhatsApp and didn\u2019t block the deals.",
      "\u201cThe F.T.C.\u2019s claims are an effort to rewrite antitrust laws and upend settled expectations of merger review, declaring to the business community that no sale is ever final,\u201d Facebook said on Thursday.",
      "The company has until Oct. 4 to respond to the new complaint or to file for Mr. Boasberg to dismiss the case. Last month, it filed a petition for Ms. Khan to recuse herself from the agency\u2019s case, saying her work on a House investigation into platform monopolies showed a bias against the company. The F.T.C. on Thursday said that it had dismissed that petition, saying that Facebook would receive \u201cthe appropriate constitutional due process protections\u201d because the case would be tried before a federal judge.",
      "Bill Kovacic, a former chairman of the F.T.C., said the agency did enough to \u201clive to fight another day.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe judge said \u2018show your work,\u2019 and it appears they did enough to satisfy that request,\u201d he said.",
      "But he warned the case would face a long and steep challenge. The F.T.C. has won fewer than 20 of its monopoly cases in the appeals court since the agency started more than 100 years ago, he said.",
      "\u201cFacebook will fight this ferociously,\u201d Mr. Kovacic added.",

    "content": [
      "The following is a transcript of President Biden\u2019s remarks about Afghanistan on Tuesday, a day after the United States concluded its two-decade war there with the end of evacuation flights and the departure of the last American troops.",
      "Last night in Kabul, the United States ended 20 years of war in Afghanistan. The longest war in American history. We completed one of the biggest airlifts in history with more than 120,000 people evacuated to safety. That number is more than double what most experts thought were possible. No nation, no nation has ever done anything like it in all of history. Only the United States had the capacity and the will and ability to do it, and we did it today.",
      "The extraordinary success of this mission was due to the incredible skill, bravery and selfless courage of the United States military and our diplomats and intelligence professionals. For weeks, they risked their lives to get American citizens, Afghans who helped us, citizens of our allies and partners and others on board planes and out of the country.",
      "They did it facing a crush of enormous crowds seeking to leave the country. They did it knowing ISIS-K terrorists, sworn enemies of the Taliban, were lurking in the midst of those crowds. And still, the women and men of the United States military, our diplomatic corps and intelligence professionals did their job and did it well. Risking their lives, not for professional gains but to serve others. Not in a mission of war but in a mission of mercy.",
      "Twenty service members were wounded in the service of this mission. Thirteen heroes gave their lives. I was just at Dover Air Force Base for the dignified transfer. We owe them and their families a debt of gratitude we can never repay, but we should never, ever forget.",
      "In April, I made a decision to end this war. As part of that decision, we set the date of Aug. 31 for American troops to withdraw. The assumption was that more than 300,000 Afghan national security forces that we had trained over the past two decades and equipped would be a strong adversary in their civil wars with the Taliban.",
      "That assumption, that the Afghan government would be able to hold on for a period of time beyond military drawdown, turned out not to be accurate. But I still instructed our national security team to prepare for every eventuality, even that one. And that\u2019s what we did. So we were ready when the Afghan security forces, after two decades of fighting for their country and losing thousands of their own, did not hold on as long as anyone expected.",
      "We were ready when they and the people of Afghanistan watched their own government collapse and the president flee amid the corruption and malfeasance, handing over the country to their enemy the Taliban and significantly increasing the risk to U.S. personnel and our allies.",
      "As a result, to safely extract Americans citizens before Aug. 31, as well as embassy personnel, allies and partners and those Afghans who had worked with us and fought alongside of us for 20 years, I had authorized 6,000 American troops to Kabul to help secure the airport.",
      "As Gen. [Kenneth F.] McKenzie said, this is the way the mission was designed. It was designed to operate under severe stress and attack, and that\u2019s what it did. Since March, we reached out 19 times to Americans in Afghanistan, with multiple warnings and offers to help them leave Afghanistan, all the way back as far as March. After we started the evacuation 17 days ago, we did initial outreach and analysis and identified around 5,000 Americans who had decided earlier to stay in Afghanistan but now wanted to leave.",
      "Our Operation Allied Rescue ended up getting more than 5,500 Americans out. We got out thousands of citizens and diplomats from those countries that went into Afghanistan with us to get Bin Laden. We got out locally employed staff at the United States Embassy and their families, totaling roughly 2,500 people. We got thousands of Afghan translators and interpreters and others who supported the United States out as well.",
      "Now we believe that about 100 to 200 Americans remain in Afghanistan with some intention to leave. Most of those that remain are dual citizens, longtime residents who had earlier decided to stay because of their family roots in Afghanistan.",
      "The bottom line: Ninety percent of Americans in Afghanistan who wanted to leave were able to leave. And for those remaining Americans, there is no deadline. We remain committed to get them out if they want to come out.",
      "Secretary of State [Antony J.] Blinken is leading the continued diplomatic efforts to ensure safe passage for any American, Afghan partner or foreign national who wants to leave Afghanistan. In fact, just yesterday, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution that sent a clear message about what the international community expects the Taliban to deliver on moving forward. Notably, freedom of travel. Freedom to leave. And together we\u2019re joined by over 100 countries that are determined to make sure the Taliban upholds those commitments. It will include ongoing efforts in Afghanistan to reopen the airport, as well as overland routes, allowing for continued departure to those who want to leave and deliver humanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistan.",
      "The Taliban has made public commitments, broadcast on television and radio across Afghanistan, on safe passage for anyone wanting to leave, including those who worked alongside Americans. We don\u2019t take them by their word alone but by their actions. And we have leverage to make sure those commitments are met.",
      "Let me be clear: Leaving Aug. 31 is not due to an arbitrary deadline. It was designed to save American lives. My predecessor, the former president, signed an agreement with the Taliban to remove U.S. troops by May 1, just months after I was inaugurated. It included no requirement that Taliban work out a cooperative governing arrangement with the Afghan government. But it did authorize the release of 5,000 prisoners last year, including some of the Taliban\u2019s top war commanders, among those who just took control of Afghanistan.",
      "By the time I came to office, the Taliban was in its strongest military position since 2001, controlling or contesting nearly half of the country. The previous administration\u2019s agreement said that if we stuck to the May 1 deadline that they had signed on to leave by, the Taliban wouldn\u2019t attack any American forces. But if we stayed, all bets were off.",
      "So we were left with a simple decision: Either follow through on the commitment made by the last administration and leave Afghanistan, or say we weren\u2019t leaving and commit another tens of thousands more troops. Going back to war. That was the choice, the real choice. Between leaving or escalating. I was not going to extend this forever war. And I was not extending a forever exit.",
      "The decision to end the military airlift operations at Kabul airport was based on the unanimous recommendation of my civilian and military advisers. The secretary of state, the secretary of defense, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and all the service chiefs and the commanders in the field. Their recommendation was that the safest way to secure the passage of the remaining Americans and others out of the country was not to continue as 6,000 troops on the ground in harm\u2019s way in Kabul, but rather to get them out through nonmilitary means.",
      "In the 17 days that we operated in Kabul, after the Taliban seized power, we engaged in an around-the-clock effort to provide every American the opportunity to leave. Our State Department was working 24/7 contacting and talking and, in some cases, walking Americans into the airport. Again, more than 5,500 Americans were airlifted out. And for those who remain, we will make arrangements to get them out if they so choose.",
      "As for the Afghans, we and our partners have airlifted 100,000 of them. No country in history has done more to airlift out the residents of another country than we have done. We will continue to work to help more people leave the country who are at risk. We\u2019re far from done.",
      "For now, I urge all Americans to join me in grateful prayer for our troops and diplomats and intelligence officers who carried out this mission of mercy in Kabul, and at tremendous risk with such unparalleled results. An airlift that evacuated tens of thousands to a network of volunteers and veterans who helped identify those needing evacuation, guide them to the airport and provided them for their support along the way. We\u2019re going to continue to need their help. We need your help, and I\u2019m looking forward to meeting with you. And to everyone who is now offering, or who will offer, to welcome Afghan allies to their homes around the world, including in America, we thank you.",
      "I take responsibility for the decision. Now, some say we should have started mass evacuations sooner and \u201cCouldn\u2019t this have been done in a more orderly manner?\u201d I respectfully disagree. Imagine if we had begun evacuations in June or July, bringing in thousands of American troops and evacuating more than 120,000 people in the middle of a civil war. There still would have been a rush to the airport. A breakdown in confidence and control of the government. And it still would have been very difficult and dangerous mission.",
      "The bottom line is, there is no evacuation from the end of a war that you can run without the kinds of complexities, challenges, threats we faced. None. To those who would say we should have stayed indefinitely, for years on end, they ask: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just keep doing what we were doing? Why do we have to change anything?\u201d",
      "The fact is everything had changed. My predecessor had made a deal with the Taliban. When I came into office, we faced a deadline, May 1. The Taliban onslaught was coming. We faced one of two choices: follow the agreement of the previous administration and extend it to have more time for people to get out, or send in thousands more troops and escalate the war.",
      "To those asking for a third decade of war in Afghanistan, I ask: What is the vital national interest? In my view, we only have one: to make sure Afghanistan can never be used again to launch an attack on our homeland.",
      "Remember why we went to Afghanistan in the first place? Because we were attacked by Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda on Sept. 11, 2001, and they were based in Afghanistan. We delivered justice to Bin laden on May 2, 2011. Over a decade ago. Al Qaeda was decimated.",
      "I respectfully suggest you ask yourself this question: If we had been attacked on Sept. 11, 2001, from Yemen instead of Afghanistan, would we have ever gone to war in Afghanistan? Even though the Taliban controlled Afghanistan in the year 2001? I believe the honest answer is no. That\u2019s because we had no vital interest in Afghanistan other than to prevent an attack on America\u2019s homeland and our friends. And that\u2019s true today.",
      "We succeeded in what we set out to do in Afghanistan over a decade ago. Then we stayed for another decade. It was time to end this war.",
      "This is a new world. The terror threat has metastasized across the world, well beyond Afghanistan. We face threats from Al Shabab in Somalia, Al Qaeda affiliates in Syria and the Arabian Peninsula, and ISIS attempting to create a caliphate in Syria and Iraq and establishing affiliates across Africa and Asia.",
      "The fundamental obligation of a president, in my opinion, is to defend and protect America. Not against threats of 2001, but against the threats of 2021 and tomorrow. That is the guiding principle behind my decisions about Afghanistan.",
      "I simply do not believe that the safety and security of America is enhanced by continuing to deploy thousands of American troops and spending billions of dollars a year in Afghanistan. But I also know that the threat from terrorism continues in its pernicious and evil nature. But it\u2019s changed. Expanded to other countries. Our strategy has to change, too.",
      "We will maintain the fight against terrorism in Afghanistan and other countries. We just don\u2019t need to fight a ground war to do it. We have what\u2019s called over-the-horizon capabilities, which means we can strike terrorists and targets without American boots on the ground, very few if needed.",
      "We have shown that capacity in just the last week. We struck ISIS-K remotely, days after they murdered 13 of our service members and dozen of innocent Afghans. And to ISIS-K, we are not done with you yet.",
      "As commander in chief, I firmly believe the best path to guard our safety and our security lies in a tough, unforgiving, targeted, precise strategy that goes after terror where it is today. Not where it was two decades ago. That\u2019s what is in our national interest.",
      "And here is the critical thing to understand: The world is changing. We\u2019re engaged in a serious competition with China. We\u2019re dealing with the challenges on multiple fronts with Russia. We\u2019re confronted with cyberattacks and nuclear proliferation. We have to shore up American competitiveness to meet these new challenges and the competition for the 21st century. And we can do both: fight terrorism, and take on new threats that are here now and will continue to be here in the future. And there\u2019s nothing China or Russia would rather have, would want more in this competition, than the United States to be bogged down another decade in Afghanistan.",
      "As we turn the page on the foreign policy that\u2019s guided our nation the last two decades, we\u2019ve got to learn from our mistakes. To me there are two that are paramount: First, we must set missions with clear, achievable goals, not ones we\u2019ll never reach. And second, we must stay clearly focused on the fundamental national security interest of the United States of America.",
      "This decision about Afghanistan is not just about Afghanistan. It\u2019s about ending an era of major military operations to remake other countries. We saw a mission of counterterrorism in Afghanistan, getting the terrorists to stop the attacks, morph into a counterinsurgency, nation building, trying to create a democratic, cohesive and united Afghanistan. Something that has never been done over many centuries of Afghan\u2019s history. Moving on from that mind-set and those kind of large-scale troop deployments will make us stronger and more effective and safer at home.",
      "And for anyone who gets the wrong idea, let me say clearly: To those who wish America harm, to those engaged in terrorism against us or our allies, know this. The United States will never rest. We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down to the ends of the Earth, and you will pay the ultimate price.",
      "Let me be clear. We\u2019ll continue to support the Afghan people through diplomacy, international influence and humanitarian aid. We will continue to push for regional diplomacy engagement to prevent violence and instability. We\u2019ll continue to speak out for the basic rights of the Afghan people, especially women and girls, as we speak out for women and girls all around the globe.",
      "And I\u2019ve been clear that human rights will be the center of our foreign policy. But the way to do that is not through endless military deployments, but through diplomacy, economic tools and rallying the rest of the world for support.",
      "My fellow Americans, the war in Afghanistan is now over. I\u2019m the fourth president that must face the issue of whether and when to end this war. When I was running for president, I made a commitment to the American people that I would end this war. Today I\u2019ve honored that commitment. It was time to be honest with the American people again. We no longer had a clear purpose in an open-ended mission in Afghanistan. After 20 years of war in Afghanistan, I refuse to send another generation of America\u2019s sons and daughters to fight a war that should have ended long ago.",
      "After more than $2 trillion spent in Afghanistan \u2014 costs that researchers at Brown University estimated would be over $300 million a day for 20 years in Afghanistan. For two decades. Yes. The American people should hear this: $300 million a day for two decades. You take the number of one trillion, as many say, that\u2019s still $150 million a day for two decades. And what have we lost as a consequence in terms of opportunities?",
      "I refuse to continue a war that was no longer in the service of the vital national interests of our people. And most of all, after 800,000 Americans serving in Afghanistan \u2014 I\u2019ve traveled that whole country. Brave and honorable service. After 20,744 American servicemen and -women injured, and the loss of 2,461 American personnel, including 13 lives lost just this week, I refuse to open another decade of warfare in Afghanistan.",
      "We\u2019ve been a nation too long at war. If you\u2019re 20 years old today, you\u2019ve never known an America at peace. So when I hear that we could have, should have, continued this so-called low-grade effort in Afghanistan, at low risk to our service members, at low cost, I don\u2019t think enough people understand how much we have asked of the 1 percent of this country who put that uniform on, willing to put their lives on the line in defense of our nation.",
      "Maybe it\u2019s because my deceased son Beau served in Iraq for a full year. Before that, well \u2014 maybe it\u2019s because of what I\u2019ve seen over the years as senator, vice president and president traveling these countries. A lot of our veterans and their families have gone through hell. Deployment after deployment, months and years away from their families, missed birthdays, anniversaries, empty chairs at holidays, financial struggles, divorces, loss of limbs, traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress.",
      "We see it in the struggles many have when they come home. We see it in the strain on their families and caregivers. We see it in the strain of their families when they\u2019re not there. We see it in the grief borne by their survivors. The cost of war, they will carry with them their whole lives.",
      "Most tragically, we see it in the shocking and stunning statistic that should give pause to anyone who thinks war can ever be low grade, low risk or low cost: Eighteen veterans, on average, who die by suicide every single day in America. Not in a far-off place, but right here in America.",
      "There\u2019s nothing low grade or low risk or low cost about any war. It\u2019s time to end the war in Afghanistan. As we close 20 years of war and strife and pain and sacrifice, it\u2019s time to look for the future, not the past. To a future that\u2019s safer, to a future that\u2019s more secure. To a future that honors those who\u2019ve served and all those who gave what President Lincoln called their \u201clast full measure of devotion.\u201d I give you my word with all of my heart. I believe this is the right decision, a wise decision and the best decision for America.",
      "Thank you. Thank you and may God bless you all. And may God protect our troops."

Now, after the Taliban\u2019s takeover, they are more desperate than ever to leave \u2014 but swift, safe passage to the United States may prove elusive.",
      "More than 300,000 Afghan civilians have been affiliated with the American mission over its two-decade presence in the country, according to the International Rescue Committee, but a minority qualify for refugee protection in the United States.",
      "Among them are those who worked with the U.S. military, qualifying them and their families for special immigrant visas. However, thousands are stuck in a yearslong backlog that is only ballooning as the situation on the ground deteriorates after the withdrawal of American troops.",
      "About 2,000 such people whose cases already had been approved have arrived in the United States on evacuation flights from Kabul, the capital, that began in July. The most recent arrivals landed on American soil late on Sunday before being processed at a military base in Virginia, according to refugee resettlement agencies.",
      "President Biden said on Monday while addressing the nation that there were plans to airlift more Afghan families in \u201ccoming days,\u201d though he provided no details.",
      "Refugee advocates said they feared that thousands of vulnerable people were likely to be left behind, at their peril, as militants tightened their grip on Afghanistan\u2019s territory. The Taliban have closed border crossings, leaving the Kabul airport as the only exit from the country.",
      "Those who supported the U.S. mission face the possibility of grave retribution from the Taliban, said Jenny Yang, vice president for advocacy and policy at World Relief, which has resettled hundreds of special immigrant visa recipients in recent years.",
      "Since 2002, the United States has employed Afghans to assist U.S. troops, diplomats and aid workers. Many were threatened, kidnapped and attacked, and an unknown number killed, as a result of their association with the United States. In response, Congress created the special immigrant visa programs to give such workers a path to legal residency in the United States.",
      "But the programs, which enjoy broad bipartisan support, have been marred by processing delays.",
      "Applicants must show they have been employed for at least two years by the U.S. government or an associated entity. Among other paperwork, they must prove they performed valuable service by providing a recommendation from an American supervisor. They must also show that they have experienced, or are experiencing, a serious threat as a consequence of their work for the United States.",
      "More than 15,000 Afghan nationals, plus family members, have already been resettled in the United States with special immigrant visas, out of a total of 34,500 authorized visas.",

      "\u201cWe have clients who applied 10 years ago,\u201d said Betsy Fisher, director of strategy at the International Refugee Assistance Project. \u201cSome have applied in the last few weeks out of concern for their lives.\u201d",
      "Critics say that the U.S. government, going back several administrations, has delayed special immigrant visa approvals by demanding an extraordinary amount of documentation as part of an unwieldy 14-step process.",
      "Applicants have faced average wait times of three years, though Congress had specified that it should take no more than nine months. Many have been waiting as long as a decade for the outcome of their cases.",
      "\u201cWe see people fall into pernicious cycles, where they get a document, submit it and the review process takes so long that the office then requires updated information that can take months or years to review,\u201d Ms. Fisher said.",
      "In addition, security checks can often take years to complete, she said.",
      "Special immigrant visa recipients are eligible for the same resettlement benefits as refugees. They arrive with green cards, and can apply for U.S. citizenship after five years. But they are not classified as refugees, nor do they count against the number of refugees that the United States commits to admitting each year.",
      "The U.S. government since July has evacuated about 2,000 interpreters and their family members whose cases had already been approved. They were brought from Kabul to the Fort Lee military base south of Richmond, Va., and many have since been sent to cities across the country.",
      "But staff members from refugee resettlement agencies were notified after the latest flight landed on Sunday that plans to evacuate more Afghans had been suspended.",
      "Garry Reid, a civilian Pentagon official charged with handling the evacuations, said on Monday that 700 Afghan allies had been evacuated in the previous 48 hours. He said the United States would scale up by receiving more departing Afghans at U.S. military bases, but he did not offer a specific timeline.",
      "Last week, U.S. officials announced that 1,000 staff members would be dispatched to Qatar, where many of those leaving Afghanistan are assembling, to accelerate the processing of visas.",

      "The Biden administration recently announced it would allow Afghans to use the regular U.S. refugee program, another pathway to resettlement. Eligible applicants would include people who worked for nongovernmental organizations, media outlets and others affiliated with the United States, as long as they are referred by their employer.",

      "\u201cThis is critical progress as millions of kids head back to school, and, in fact, the vaccination rate among adolescents is growing faster than any other age group,\u201d Mr. Zients said at a news conference with the White House Covid-19 response team. \u201cAnd we will continue to do everything we can to get this group of adolescents vaccinated.\u201d",
      "The pace of vaccinations has picked up in recent weeks after the extremely contagious Delta variant drove a surge in cases, hospitalizations and deaths around the country \u2014 all of which have reached levels not seen since last winter.",
      "And vaccinating adolescents is particularly important now that schools are reopening, said Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, because children who are younger than 12 are not yet authorized to receive any of the vaccines and inoculating as many people around them as possible will help keep them safe.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s human nature to protect our children above all else, and the best way to protect them is to get everyone who is eligible vaccinated and surround children who are not yet vaccine-eligible with people who are vaccinated to effectively shield them from Covid harm,\u201d Dr. Walensky said. She added that widespread vaccination, coupled with measures like masking and social distancing, would help keep children safe in a school setting.",
      "Data from the C.D.C. indicate that there have been nearly 4 million reported cases of Covid-19 and 385 deaths involving the disease in children 17 and younger in the United States.",
      "Earlier this week the F.D.A. granted full approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for those ages 16 and older, but it is not yet clear when such an approval, which can make it easier to impose vaccine mandates, might be granted for adolescents and younger children. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine remains available to those who are 12 to 15 years old under emergency use authorization.",

      "It noted several possible limitations, including that adolescents who received their shots from different entities might not have been reported as completing their course of treatment, but concluded that vaccinating teenagers was key to a safer return to school, especially because of the Delta variant.",
      "The study indicated that vaccination uptake varied widely by state, with adolescents in the Northeast and on the West Coast most likely to be inoculated, and those ages 16 to 17 more likely to be vaccinated than those 12 to 15. This is probably because the Pfizer vaccine has been authorized for the older subset for months longer.",
      "Some teenagers reported receiving vaccines made by Moderna and Johnson & Johnson even though they have not been authorized for those younger than 18.",
      "The study recommended \u201cconcerted outreach\u201d to adolescents and their parents, and \u201cschool-based vaccination programs, such as those for seasonal influenza and routine adolescent vaccination,\u201d to get more shots in arms.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A sluggish State Department response to the Taliban\u2019s rapid takeover of Kabul, Afghanistan\u2019s capital, has stranded thousands of Afghans who helped the United States and are now clamoring to be evacuated as they wait for their immigration visas to be approved, two U.S. officials said.",
      "As many as 6,000 people \u2014 including former interpreters and cultural and political advisers \u2014 were on standby to be flown out of Kabul\u2019s airport late on Thursday night or early Friday alone, after a days-long pause in the processing of visas for Afghans who had worked for the American military or embassy during the 20-year war, the State Department said.",
      "Thousands more are expected to be vetted and evacuated on a daily basis after a small influx of consular officers and other diplomats \u2014 including the former ambassador to Afghanistan, John R. Bass \u2014 arrived in Kabul on Thursday to speed the visa processing. Diplomats are also deploying to Qatar and Kuwait, where U.S. military bases will serve as way stations for people arriving from Afghanistan as they search for a final destination.",
      "\u201cThis is an operation that will continue at as fast a clip as we can possibly manage,\u201d Ned Price, a State Department spokesman, told reporters on Thursday. He said American officials were continuously alerting Afghans who had been cleared to fly, including more than 800 on Wednesday night.",
      "\u201cOur hope is that tomorrow we\u2019ll be able to process even more,\u201d Mr. Price said. \u201cBut ultimately, the metric we care about most is how many people we are able to repatriate here to the United States, or bring to third countries. That is our goal.\u201d",
      "The U.S. military is only evacuating Afghans who have completed what Mr. Price called \u201ca certain stage of the security-vetting procedure.\u201d He would not provide details of the process, but another official said security checks were continuing even as Afghans were being flown to safety.",
      "But two other U.S. officials described growing impatience across the Biden administration with the State Department\u2019s inability to process visas more quickly, as thousands of Afghans who had already risked their lives to ally with the United States waited fearfully outside the gate of the international airport in Kabul.",
      "One of the officials described how challenging it was to ensure that those who helped the United States could reach the airport safely with other Afghans also trying to evacuate and the Taliban operating checkpoints across the capital.",
      "Officials also echoed refugee advocates, who accused the State Department of having been caught flat-footed in processing the special immigrant visas for Afghans \u2014 even though President Biden announced in April that the American military would be leaving by the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that led to the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan.",
      "\u201cThere are tens of thousands of Americans and Afghans literally at the gate,\u201d said Sunil Varghese, the policy director for the International Refugee Assistance Project. \u201cThis could have been completely avoided if evacuation was part of the military withdrawal. This was avoidable, and we\u2019re at the 11th hour now.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut that being said, I think we can make sure this is an evacuation and not something more tragic,\u201d Mr. Varghese said.",
      "As of Thursday afternoon, the U.S. military had evacuated 7,000 Americans, Afghans and others since Saturday, officials said. That is still well short of the 5,000 to 9,000 passengers a day that the military will be able to fly out once the evacuation process is at full throttle, Defense Department officials said.",
      "Armed fighter jets made passes over Kabul and Hamid Karzai International Airport as part of the effort on Thursday to secure the enormous evacuation in what the Pentagon\u2019s press secretary, John F. Kirby, said was an \u201coverwatch\u201d mission.",
      "There have been reports of non-American evacuation flights leaving with many empty seats, a sign of the difficulties thousands of people have faced trying to make their way to the airport. The Pentagon has warned the Taliban not to interfere with the evacuation.",
      "Representative Tom Malinowski, Democrat of New Jersey, said even Afghans who had been vetted and told to come to the airport were unable to get past U.S. troops at the airport\u2019s gate. He called it \u201cinexcusable\u201d that the State Department and Pentagon were not coordinating better to ensure \u201cthat whoever the U.S. government invites will be recognized and allowed in by people at the gates who know what they\u2019re doing.\u201d",
      "Mr. Malinowski, an assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor under the Obama administration, said that disconnect dominated the current administration\u2019s attention for much of Thursday.",
      "The problem \u201cis within our power to solve,\u201d Mr. Malinowski said, adding, \u201cIt has not gotten better.\u201d",
      "Maj. Gen. William Taylor told reporters on Thursday that multiple gates at the airport were now open.",
      "The process of vetting Afghans who qualify for the special immigrant visa was dormant for nearly a year, after the State Department shut down much of its classified consular operations when the first wave of the coronavirus forced employees to work from home.",
      "The visa system had a backlog of 17,000 cases when Mr. Biden took office in January, according to the State Department. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul resumed interviewing Afghans for the visas in February, and was processing at least 100 people each week before the pandemic halted the operation again in June.",
      "In mid-July, the Pentagon began an expedited airlift of Afghans who had worked for the U.S. government. Under that effort, called Operation Allies Refuge, more than 2,000 Afghans were evacuated from Kabul before the Taliban closed in on the capital last week, forcing the Biden administration to temporarily abandon its visa processing and focus on ensuring that Americans could escape.",
      "Mr. Price said the State Department also had been working to find countries that would take in the evacuated Afghans who had not had time to apply for settlement elsewhere in their rush to leave the country. The governments of Albania, Uganda, Canada, Mexico and Chile had offered to take in some people for varying periods of time, he said.",
      "The U.S. government is not charging Afghan refugees for the evacuations. A number of private operations are also organizing flights out of Afghanistan, including to countries with less rigorous documentation requirements, although some are asking evacuees to pay for seats.",
      "Seats on some private flights in the days after the U.S. withdrawal went for $100,000 each or more, according to a person familiar with the fares.",
      "People involved in the private flights said they had been working with the State Department, the Pentagon and the White House to obtain proper clearances to fly into and out of the airport in Kabul, but that their efforts had been complicated by disorganization from the U.S. government, as well as difficulties transporting evacuees to the airport and securing insurance for planes.",
      "One effort that has arranged flights from Kabul to a nearby country was organized by former Representative Scott Taylor and the Washington fixer Robert Stryk, whose lobbying firm was paid $160,000 to represent Afghanistan\u2019s government for a few months in 2017.",
      "For an initial flight, dozens of Afghan passengers paid as much as $12,500 per seat. But since then, the operation has been able to lower prices to roughly what commercial airlines were charging before the American military withdrawal, said Mr. Taylor, who served as a member of the Navy SEALs before representing Virginia as a Republican in Congress.",
      "The operation has come to include members of his former campaign staff, as well as political donors who have offered to pay some upfront costs and a Virginia-based logistics company called Regulus Global that works for the U.S. government in global hot spots.",
      "\u201cWe have a command center right now that\u2019s 24/7,\u201d said Mr. Taylor. \u201cWe are just trying to help as many people as possible.\u201d",
      "After Mr. Taylor posted a message on LinkedIn indicating that he was arranging flights, his team began fielding thousands of requests from American citizens, Afghans, corporations and academic institutions, he said.",
      "\u201cPeople are scared for their lives. When you read some of these messages, it\u2019s real sad,\u201d said Mr. Taylor, who suggested some of the chaos could have been mitigated with better planning by the U.S. government. \u201cThis was really botched, man. I am a military guy, and this is crazy to me.\u201d",
      "At least one flight of people evacuated from Afghanistan arrived at Dulles International Airport outside Washington on Thursday, with its passengers receiving additional processing and coronavirus testing upon landing.",
      "Timothy Young, a spokesman for Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, said fewer people were expected to arrive \u201cwith visas in hand\u201d on the flights from Kabul \u2014 a sign the State Department was loosening its vetting restrictions to speed the evacuations."

      "At 5:48 p.m., the bomber, wearing a 25-pound explosive vest under clothing, walked up to the group of Americans who were frisking people hoping to enter the complex. He waited, officials said, until just before he was about to be searched by the American troops. And then he detonated the bomb, which was unusually large for a suicide vest, killing himself and igniting an attack that would leave dozens of people dead, including 13 American service members.",
      "\u201cThis is close-up war \u2014 the breath of the person you are searching is upon you,\u201d Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., the head of United States Central Command, said on Thursday after the attack, describing the face-to-face contact between Marines at the airport gate and Afghans they must search before allowing them to enter.",
      "Pentagon officials said they were still piecing together the chain of events that took place at Abbey Gate on Thursday. There will be after-action reviews and storyboards with detailed lists of what led up to that moment. There will be questions: Why were so many service members grouped so close together? How did the bomber evade the Taliban checkpoints? Did someone let him through?",
      "U.S. military forces conducted their first reprisal strike in Afghanistan since the attack on Friday, \u201can over-the-horizon counterterrorism operation\u201d in the Nangarhar Province \u201cagainst an ISIS-K planner,\u201d said Capt. Bill Urban, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command, referring to the Afghan affiliate of the Islamic State that claimed responsibility for Thursday\u2019s attack.",
      "\u201cInitial indications are that we killed the target,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know of no civilian casualties.\u201d",
      "As the scope of the damage from Thursday\u2019s bombing became clearer, health officials in Kabul raised the death toll, saying at least 170 people had been killed. Afghans seeking to escape Taliban rule continued to stream to the airport on Friday, but the size of the crowd was estimated in the hundreds, down from the thousands who were there when the blast occurred. The airport remained largely locked down, although evacuation flights continued.",
      "Just after 2 p.m. Friday, as another gray-tailed U.S. aircraft lifted into the sky from the airport, this one carrying the flag-draped coffins of the 13 Americans, the anguish from Thursday\u2019s bombing spread from Kabul to Kansas. At the mortuary at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, service members were bracing for the ritual of dressing and preparing yet another group of American troops killed in Afghanistan.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m never been one for politics and I\u2019m not going to start now,\u201d Marilyn Soviak, the sister of Maxton Soviak, a Navy corpsman from Ohio who was among the dead, posted on Instagram. \u201cWhat I will say is that my beautiful, intelligent, beat-to-the-sound of his own drum, annoying, charming baby brother was killed yesterday helping to save lives.\u201d",
      "Just after the bomb went off, Defense Department officials said, fighters nearby began firing weapons. The officials said that some of the Americans and Afghans at Abbey Gate might have been hit by that gunfire. There was so much confusion in the aftermath of the explosion that the military initially reported that a second suicide bombing had taken place at nearby Baron Hotel. That turned out to be false, according to Maj. Gen. Hank Taylor, the Joint Staff deputy director for regional operations.",
      "At 25 pounds, the vest worn by the suicide bomber did untold damage. According to Army manuals, suicide bombers typically wear either a belt containing 10 pounds or less of explosives, or a vest packed with 10 to 20 pounds of explosives. With a 25-pound vest that included pieces of metal that acted as lethal shrapnel, the bomber also wounded dozens of Afghans, as well as 14 additional American troops, who were medevacked to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center near the Ramstein Air Base in Germany.",
      "From the moment last month that Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III ordered a Marine Expeditionary Unit from the U.S.S. Iwo Jima to disembark in Kuwait and be ready to help with evacuations in the event that Kabul fell to a surging Taliban, it has been clear to American troops that they could once again end up on the front lines of a war in Afghanistan that has been declared finished by a succession of presidents.",
      "It did not take long for Hamid Karzai International Airport to transform from a commercial hub to the final defensive position for the U.S. military, which had once surged tens of thousands of troops to far-flung corners of Afghanistan. Apache gunships circled overhead, and Marine quick-reaction forces orbited the perimeter. In the command center, feeds from drones and surveillance cameras piped in infrared images of crowds massing at the gates.",
      "The Marines who were patrolling Abbey Gate on Thursday had arrived in Kabul about a week earlier. They were fresh, and linked up with their British paratrooper counterparts with one goal in mind: Get as many people through as possible. That meant using an interpreter and a loudspeaker to persuade a surging crowd to move back, a painstaking task that allowed the Marines to open two entry points.",
      "The fall of Kabul had unleashed a tsunami of phone calls, emails and desperate texts from the foreign organizations that had worked in Afghanistan over the past 20 years, all imploring the Pentagon for help getting their Afghan workers and allies evacuated. Other people who worked with Afghans, including teachers who visited schools in Afghanistan, joined American senators, media chiefs and the heads of global organizations in asking for help for their former partners, who are in danger of Taliban reprisals.",
      "The requests reached the American troops at Kabul airport. \u201cThe Marines who died were the ones who were helping our team,\u201d said Cori Shepherd, a filmmaker who once helped Afghan girls come to school in the United States. \u201cThese men were quite literally going into the masses and pulling our women to safety, while coordinating with our guy to find them. The men who worked Abbey Gate were brave beyond measure.\u201d",
      "Rear Adm. Peter G. Vasely, a former member of the Navy SEALs running the airport operation, asked Taliban commanders to check people heading toward Abbey Gate more closely, the officials said. The Taliban, General McKenzie told reporters on Thursday, may have \u201cthwarted\u201d other attempts.",
      "But in the end, \u201cthere\u2019s no substitute for a young man or woman \u2014 a young United States man or woman \u2014 standing up there conducting a search of that person before we let him in,\u201d General McKenzie said.",
      "The effort to get vulnerable people out of Afghanistan will continue, he said. \u201cBecause that is why we are there.\u201d"

      "As coronavirus cases surge again across the country, driven by the highly contagious Delta variant, a small number of hotels in the United States have announced that they will require proof of vaccination from guests and staff.",
      "Accommodations such as PUBLIC Hotel, Equinox Hotel and Wythe Hotel, all in New York City, Urban Cowboy Lodge in Big Indian, N.Y., a hamlet in the Catskill Mountains, and Pilgrim House in Provincetown, Mass., are among the first in the United States to announce that they will require evidence of vaccination, via a physical card or a digital verification, from their guests.",
      "The precedent for hotels requiring vaccination is already being set beyond the contiguous United States. In August, Puerto Rico issued an island-wide vaccine mandate that requires guests and staff at all hotels, guesthouses and short-term rentals, including Airbnb, to provide proof of vaccination or a negative PCR or antigen test taken within 72 hours before their visit. If a person is staying longer than a week, they will need to present negative tests to hotel staff on a weekly basis.",
      "Elite Island Resorts, a Florida-based company that runs a collection of all-inclusive Caribbean resorts stretching from Antigua to Panama, announced that all guests over the age of 12 would be required to show proof of Covid-19 vaccination upon arrival beginning on Sept. 1.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s imperative for us to protect the hospitals of these smaller island nations, and while they have had a good track record so far with Covid-19, we must remain vigilant, and all do our part to become part of the solution,\u201d wrote Robert A. Barrett, the founder and chief executive of Elite Island Resorts, in the company\u2019s announcement.",
      "Although European destinations are rolling out various vaccine mandates, hotels are mostly not requiring proof of immunization. In Portugal, however, hotel guests need to show proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test.",
      "In the United States, PUBLIC Hotel, a boutique accommodation on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side owned by the hotel magnate Ian Schrager, earlier this month became one of the country\u2019s first hotels to mandate proof of vaccination from its guests and staff. The requirement will begin on Sept. 5, with only medical and religious exemptions.",
      "\u201cWe need to beat Covid-19 together,\u201d Mr. Schrager said in a news release that announced his decision. \u201cAfter all, looking after people is our business. We just didn\u2019t see how to fulfill this responsibility without taking action.\u201d",
      "At Equinox Hotel New York, the first hotel by the luxury fitness company, guests will be required to show proof of first vaccination from Sept. 13. Equinox is also requiring on-site staff to be vaccinated.",

      "While industry leaders may be encouraging vaccination, some hospitality experts aren\u2019t convinced that there will be a widespread movement of hotels requiring vaccination.",
      "\u201cAt the current stage, I don\u2019t think we will see broad vaccine requirements by hotels,\u201d said Christopher K. Anderson, a professor at the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration.",
      "\u201cAt present not even all major hotel brands are requiring their employees to be vaccinated \u2014 let alone guests,\u201d Mr. Anderson said in an email. He added that boutique hotels are likely to find controlling vaccine mandates easier than the larger chains.",
      "As of late August, the larger U.S. hotel chains, including Marriott International, Hyatt and Hilton, are not requiring guests to be vaccinated.",
      "While guests at Marriott hotels are not required to be vaccinated, proof of vaccine verification may be required by local jurisdictions, according to Sarah Brown, a spokeswoman of Marriott International. And the company is offering incentives for its employees to get vaccinated.",
      "\u201cIn March, Marriott announced the creation of the Vaccination Care Program, which provides a financial award to U.S. and Canadian associates at its managed properties who get vaccinated for Covid-19, the flexibility for vaccination appointments and education on the benefits of vaccination,\u201d Ms. Brown said in an email. \u201cEmployees receive the equivalent of four hours of pay upon completion of the vaccination.\u201d",

    "title": "The U.S. Is Getting a Crash Course in Scientific Uncertainty",
    "content": [
      "When the coronavirus surfaced last year, no one was prepared for it to invade every aspect of daily life for so long, so insidiously. The pandemic has forced Americans to wrestle with life-or-death choices every day of the past 18 months \u2014 and there\u2019s no end in sight.",
      "Scientific understanding of the virus changes by the hour, it seems. The virus spreads only by close contact or on contaminated surfaces, then turns out to be airborne. The virus mutates slowly, but then emerges in a series of dangerous new forms. Americans don\u2019t need to wear masks. Wait, they do.",
      "At no point in this ordeal has the ground beneath our feet seemed so uncertain. In just the past week, federal health officials said they would begin offering booster shots to all Americans in the coming months. Days earlier, those officials had assured the public that the vaccines were holding strong against the Delta variant of the virus, and that boosters would not be necessary.",
      "As early as Monday, the Food and Drug Administration is expected to formally approve the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which has already been given to scores of millions of Americans. Some holdouts found it suspicious that the vaccine was not formally approved yet somehow widely dispensed. For them, \u201cemergency authorization\u201d has never seemed quite enough.",
      "Americans are living with science as it unfolds in real time. The process has always been fluid, unpredictable. But rarely has it moved at this speed, leaving citizens to confront research findings as soon as they land at the front door, a stream of deliveries that no one ordered and no one wants.",
      "Is a visit to my ailing parent too dangerous? Do the benefits of in-person schooling outweigh the possibility of physical harm to my child? Will our family gathering turn into a superspreader event?",
      "Living with a capricious enemy has been unsettling even for researchers, public health officials and journalists who are used to the mutable nature of science. They, too, have frequently agonized over the best way to keep themselves and their loved ones safe.",
      "But to frustrated Americans unfamiliar with the circuitous and often contentious path to scientific discovery, public health officials have seemed at times to be moving the goal posts and flip-flopping, or misleading, even lying to, the country.",
      "Most of the time, scientists are \u201cedging forward in a very incremental way,\u201d said Richard Sever, assistant director of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press and a co-founder of two popular websites, bioRxiv and medRxiv, where scientists post new research.",
      "\u201cThere are blind alleys that people go down, and a lot of the time you kind of don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "Biology and medicine are particularly demanding fields. Ideas are evaluated for years, sometimes decades, before they are accepted.",
      "Researchers first frame the hypothesis, then design experiments to test it. Data from hundreds of studies, often by competing teams, are analyzed before the community of experts comes to a conclusion.",
      "In the interim, scientists present the findings to their peers, often at niche conferences that are off-limits to journalists and the general public, and hone their ideas based on the feedback they receive. It\u2019s not unusual to see attendees at these meetings point out \u2014 sometimes harshly \u2014 every flaw in a study\u2019s methods or conclusions, sending the author back to the lab for more experiments.",
      "Fifteen years elapsed from the description of the first cases of H.I.V. to the identification of two proteins the virus needs to infect cells, a finding crucial to research for a cure. Even after a study has reached a satisfying conclusion, it must be submitted for rigorous review at a scientific journal, which can add another year or more before the results become public.",
      "Measured on that scale, scientists have familiarized themselves with the coronavirus at lightning speed, partly by accelerating changes to this process that were already underway.",
      "Treatment results, epidemiological models, virological discoveries \u2014 research into all aspects of the pandemic turns up online almost as quickly as authors can finish their manuscripts. \u201cPreprint\u201d studies are dissected online, particularly on Twitter, or in emails between experts.",
      "What researchers have not done is explain, in ways that the average person can understand, that this is how science has always worked.",
      "The public disagreements and debates played out in public, instead of at obscure conferences, give the false impression that science is arbitrary or that scientists are making things up as they go along.",
      "\u201cWhat a non-scientist or the layperson doesn\u2019t realize is that there is a huge bolus of information and consensus that the two people who are arguing will agree upon,\u201d Dr. Sever said.",
      "Is it really so surprising, then, that Americans feel bewildered and bamboozled, even enraged, by rapidly changing rules that have profound implications for their lives?",
      "Federal agencies have an unenviable task: Creating guidelines needed to live with an unfamiliar and rapidly spreading virus. But health officials have not acknowledged clearly or often enough that their recommendations may \u2014 and very probably would \u2014 change as the virus, and their knowledge of it, evolved.",
      "\u201cSince the beginning of this pandemic, it\u2019s been a piss-poor job, to say it in the nicest way,\u201d said Dr. Syra Madad, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard.",
      "Leaders in the United States and Britain have promised too much too soon, and have had to backtrack. Health officials have failed to frame changing advice as necessary when scientists learn more about the virus.",
      "And the officials have not really defined the pandemic\u2019s end \u2014 for example, that the virus will finally loosen its stranglehold once the infections drop below a certain mark. Without a clearly delineated goal, it can seem as if officials are asking people to give up their freedoms indefinitely.",
      "One jarring backtrack was the mask guidance by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency said in May that vaccinated people could drop their masks, advice that helped set the stage for a national reopening. Officials did not emphasize, or at least not enough, that the masks could be needed again. Now, with a new surge in infections, they are.",
      "\u201cIt can be really difficult for public perception and public understanding when these big organizations seem to reverse course in a way that is really not clear,\u201d said Ellie Murray, a science communicator and public health expert at Boston University.",
      "It does not help that the C.D.C. and the World Health Organization, the two leading public health agencies, have disagreed as frequently as they have in the past 18 months \u2014 on the definition of a pandemic, on the frequency of asymptomatic infections, on the safety of Covid-19 vaccines for pregnant women.",
      "Most Americans have a decent grasp of basic health concepts \u2014 exercise is good, junk food is bad. But many are never taught how science progresses.",
      "In 2018, 15-year-olds in the United States ranked 18th in their ability to explain scientific concepts, lagging behind their peers in not just China, Singapore and the United Kingdom, but also Poland and Slovenia.",
      "In a 2019 survey by the Pew Research Center, many Americans correctly identified fossil fuels and the rising threat of antibiotic resistance, but they were less knowledgeable about the scientific process.",
      "And basic tenets of public health often are even more of a mystery: How does my behavior affect others\u2019 health? Why should I be vaccinated if I consider myself low-risk?",
      "\u201cPeople weren\u2019t primed before to understand a lot of these concepts,\u201d Dr. Madad said. \u201cWe should have known that we couldn\u2019t expect the public to change their behaviors on a dime.\u201d",
      "Both information and disinformation about Covid-19 surface online, especially on social media, much more now than in previous public health crises. This represents a powerful opportunity to fill in the knowledge gaps for many Americans.",
      "But health officials have not taken full advantage. The C.D.C.\u2019s Twitter feed is a robotic stream of announcements. Agency experts need not just to deliver messages, but also to answer questions about how the evolving facts apply to American lives.",
      "And health officials need to be more nimble, so that bad actors don\u2019t define the narrative while real advice is delayed by a traditionally cumbersome bureaucracy.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not moving at the speed that this pandemic is moving,\u201d Dr. Murray said. \u201cThat obviously creates a perception in the public that you can\u2019t just rely on those more official sources of news.\u201d",
      "In the middle of a pandemic, health officials have some responsibility to counter the many spurious voices on Twitter and Facebook spreading everything from pseudoscience to lies. Risk communication during a public health crisis is a particular skill, and right now Americans need the balm.",
      "\u201cThere are some people whose confidence outweighs their knowledge, and they\u2019re happy to say things which are wrong,\u201d said Helen Jenkins, an infectious disease expert at Boston University.",
      "\u201cAnd then there are other people who probably have all the knowledge but keep quiet because they\u2019re scared of saying things, which is a shame as well, or just aren\u2019t good communicators.\u201d",
      "Health officials could begin even now with two-minute videos to explain basic concepts; information hotlines and public forums at the local, state and federal levels; and a responsive social media presence to counter disinformation.",
      "The road ahead will be difficult. The virus has more surprises in store, and the myths that have already become entrenched will be hard to erase.",
      "But it\u2019s not too much to hope that the lessons learned in this pandemic will help experts explain future disease outbreaks, as well as other urgent problems, like climate change, in which individual actions contribute to the whole.",
      "The first step toward educating the public and winning their trust is to make plans, and then communicate them honestly \u2014 flaws, uncertainty and all."

    "title": "Series of U.S. Actions Left Afghan Allies Frantic, Stranded and Eager to Get Out",
    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 As President Biden last month defended his decision to end the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan, he delivered a promise as old as the war itself to the Afghans who had risked their lives to assist American troops.",
      "\u201cOur message to those women and men is clear: There is a home for you in the United States, if you so choose,\u201d the president said. \u201cWe will stand with you, just as you stood with us.\u201d",
      "But his decision not to begin a mass evacuation of Afghan interpreters, guides and their relatives earlier this year has left thousands of people in limbo, stranded in a country now controlled by the Taliban after 20 years of war.",
      "Even before Mr. Biden announced the withdrawal of U.S. troops, his administration rejected frantic calls from lawmakers and activists to evacuate Afghans, who now find themselves in jeopardy.",
      "Then this summer, Afghanistan\u2019s president, Ashraf Ghani, implored Mr. Biden to hold off on evacuations until U.S. forces were gone for good, fearing that the image would undermine confidence in his government.",
      "Mr. Biden instead took steps to streamline a visa system plagued with backlogs, even though it was never intended for the mass transfer of people in a short amount of time. And in the United States, some officials were expressing concerns about potential political blowback over an influx of refugees.",
      "Taken together, the administration\u2019s actions left Mr. Biden\u2019s promise largely unfulfilled last weekend and led to searing scenes at the Kabul airport, where Afghans clung to the sides of departing American planes. And they raised questions about whether an administration that has said it would prioritize human rights abroad has abandoned the Afghans it depended upon most, dimming the United States\u2019 traditional global image as a sanctuary for the persecuted.",
      "The president on Wednesday defended the U.S. withdrawal and said he did not see a way to leave Afghanistan without \u201cchaos ensuing.\u201d In an interview with ABC News, he was asked whether the exit could have been handled better.",
      "\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it could have been handled in a way that we\u2019re going to go back in hindsight and look \u2014 but the idea that somehow, there\u2019s a way to have gotten out without chaos ensuing, I don\u2019t know how that happens,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how that happened.\u201d",
      "But critics said the administration was squarely to blame.",
      "\u201cThe failure to evacuate our allies rests solely in the hands of the Biden administration, who ignored veterans and advocates, even when they offered detailed plans on how evacuation to U.S. territory could be managed,\u201d said Chris Purdy, the project manager for the Veterans for American Ideals program at Human Rights First.",
      "Since 2002, the United States has employed Afghans to assist its troops, diplomats and aid workers. Many of those people were threatened, attacked or forced to flee their homes as a result of their work, prompting Congress in 2009 to establish a visa program specifically for those who had helped the U.S. government, as well as their immediate relatives.",
      "The program is separate from the process typically used by those fleeing persecution or torture. About 18,000 people are in the process of applying for the visas, and those applicants have at least 53,000 relatives who would be eligible to join them. Despite a congressional mandate that the United States process the visas in nine months, thousands have faced long delays for vetting.",
      "The Biden administration has evacuated about 2,000 of the applicants to military bases since mid-July, according to the State Department. It is preparing to evacuate another 800.",
      "In a series of meetings and calls since March, including before Mr. Biden announced the U.S. withdrawal, lawmakers and resettlement officials warned the White House and the State Department that the situation required an urgent response \u2014 one that could not be addressed by the special visa program, which took too much time, according to resettlement and former government officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions.",
      "The special visa program requires applicants to clear extensive levels of vetting and provide evidence of their work \u2014 documents that can be hard to obtain for families who have been forced to flee their homes. The Biden administration has blamed the previous administration for exacerbating the delays through \u201cextreme vetting\u201d requirements.",
      "The calls for swift evacuations picked up even as the Biden administration deployed additional staff members in Washington and at the embassy in Kabul to address the backlogs. One official said the administration cut through the bureaucracy by slashing in half processing delays that totaled an average of two years when Mr. Biden came into office, lobbying Congress to expand the number of visas and waiving requirements for medical examinations.",
      "Even in the best of circumstances, however, vetting refugees is enormously time-consuming. The prospect of thousands of Afghan refugees coming to the United States \u2014 rather than to other countries \u2014 raised concerns among some government officials, who argued that it would open up the White House to political pushback, according to administration officials and other people familiar with the matter.",
      "Some lawmakers, such as Representative Matt Rosendale, Republican of Montana, have expressed concerns about expediting the vetting process.",
      "\u201cNow we\u2019re going to develop a procedure with which we can vet thousands of individuals and just relocate them to the United States?\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cOnce they\u2019re settled here, they can bring additional family members here. One kind deed does not make an ally.\u201d",
      "Leaving behind Afghans \u2014 especially women and girls \u2014 could have significant political implications for Mr. Biden.",
      "\u201cThe day they start killing women in Afghanistan: That is their political nightmare,\u201d said Michael A. McFaul, a professor of international studies at Stanford University and a former ambassador to Russia during the Obama administration. \u201cThose numbers that support withdrawal are incredibly soft. If women who took U.S.A.I.D. money begin to be arrested or killed, that support will diminish quickly, and people will be outraged by the president.\u201d",
      "Refugee advocates say the Afghans\u2019 sacrifices for the United States should outweigh any potential political risk that comes with mass resettlement.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty rich, considering we trusted these people enough to put the lives of U.S. forces in their hands but not to bring them to U.S. soil,\u201d said Becca Heller, the executive director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, which is working with the State Department to assist the Afghans.",
      "In the days since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan, Mr. Biden has approved an additional $500 million for \u201cunexpected urgent refugee and migration needs of refugees, victims of conflict and other persons at risk as a result of the situation in Afghanistan.\u201d",
      "The administration also put out a call for volunteers throughout the government to help with processing the Afghan visas.

      "The Pentagon\u2019s top two leaders said on Wednesday that the United States was committed to evacuating all Americans who want to leave Afghanistan, as well as Afghans who helped the war effort and were cleared to enter the United States.",
      "\u201cWe intend to evacuate those who have been supporting us for years, and we are not going to leave them behind,\u201d Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters. \u201cAnd we will get out as many as possible.\u201d",
      "At a news conference, however, neither General Milley nor Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III would assure safe passage to the airport for Americans, Afghans and other foreigners outside the perimeter.",
      "\u201cThe forces that we have are focused on security of the airfield,\u201d Mr. Austin said. \u201cI don\u2019t have the capability to go out and extend operations currently into Kabul.\u201d",
      "The administration has insisted that its actions in recent months were calculated decisions, not missteps.",
      "It relied on intelligence showing that a Taliban takeover was 18 months away, and officials have acknowledged that they underestimated the pace of the Taliban advance when considering whether to carry out evacuations. Many Afghans were close to the end of the visa pipeline, leaving officials with an inaccurate sense that the administration had enough time to continue to rely on the visa program.",
      "The administration has also emphasized Mr. Ghani\u2019s request over the summer to hold off on evacuations until after the Americans were out of Afghanistan.",
      "\u201cThe Afghan government and its supporters, including many of the people now seeking to leave, made a passionate case that we should not conduct a mass evacuation lest we trigger a loss of confidence in the government,\u201d Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, said at a White House news briefing on Tuesday. \u201cNow, our signaling support for the government obviously did not save the government, but this was a considered judgment.\u201d",
      "The administration was hesitant for months to move the Afghans to military bases in the United States or its territories, such as Guam, preferring to move them to other countries instead, according to administration officials and people familiar with White House and State Department deliberations. Many of the evacuees would have only temporary protection while their visas were processed. If they were denied visas, they would need to apply for asylum or another form of protection in the United States \u2014 immigration programs that Republicans have seized on to attack Mr. Biden.",

Strack, a former chief of the refugee affairs division at Citizenship and Immigration Services during the Bush and Obama administrations. \u201cThe government worries about the \u2018no\u2019 cases.\u201d",
      "One former contractor for the United States who was relocated from Jalalabad strolled aimlessly outside a housing complex in eastern Maryland on Monday afternoon, familiarizing himself with his new surroundings.",
      "The man, who asked to be identified only as Masoon out of fear for his safety, said he had made it from Kabul to Maryland after a 20-hour stopover at the Fort Lee military base in Virginia. Although he arrived safely with his wife and five children, his parents and sisters remained in Jalalabad.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very happy here,\u201d Masoon said, \u201cbut I am not happy about my family.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cThe Taliban is in Jalalabad, and what can I do about that situation? It is really a dangerous thing.\u201d",
      "Masoon said he had lost all contact with them since he departed Afghanistan less than two weeks ago."

    "title": "2 U.S. Representatives Try to Explain Unauthorized Visit to Kabul",
    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Representatives Seth Moulton, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Peter Meijer, Republican of Michigan, stunned Washington when they secretly flew to Kabul on Tuesday on an unauthorized mission to witness the evacuation of Americans and Afghans.",
      "The lawmakers \u2014 Iraq war veterans who have emerged as two of the toughest critics of the Biden administration\u2019s withdrawal \u2014 took a commercial flight to the United Arab Emirates, where they boarded a military plane to Afghanistan\u2019s capital. They spoke with State Department officials and U.S. commanders and troops on the ground, and saw throngs of Afghans at the gates outside Hamid Karzai International Airport.",
      "The unauthorized trip infuriated administration officials who were already annoyed by the lawmakers\u2019 outspoken criticism and drew bipartisan rebukes from Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader. John F. Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said the trip \u201ccertainly took time away from what we had been planning to do that day.\u201d",
      "In an interview, Mr. Moulton and Mr. Meijer defended their decision to travel into a dangerous and unpredictable situation and said they had walked away with important insights.",
      "They said the trip had changed their minds about Mr. Biden\u2019s Aug. 31 deadline for a full withdrawal, which they had previously urged the administration to extend. Given that there is little chance that all Americans and Afghan allies can be evacuated in the next two weeks, they said, a swift departure is the only way for the United States to ensure that the Taliban will cooperate in eventually getting those left behind to safety.",
      "Mr. Moulton and Mr. Meijer spoke with The New York Times on Wednesday about what they saw in Kabul. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "To start out, how did the two of you ultimately decide to do this trip?",
      "Mr. Meijer: As the situation in Afghanistan deteriorated far more rapidly than many of us anticipated, we realized that we were not going to get the full story from the administration. A lot of the information that we were getting from them was outdated, inaccurate or otherwise irrelevant.",
      "Seth and I were talking and realized, I don\u2019t know what else we could do but to try to get there to understand and help communicate, especially to many of our colleagues who are struggling to get American citizens or special visa applicants out.",
      "On our first call after the fall of Kabul, frankly, when one of the senior briefers couldn\u2019t even say to us \u2014 claiming it was classified \u2014 where President [Ashraf] Ghani was, when it had been widely reported in local and international media for hours. To me, that was a bit of a breaking point, that they would use any argument to obstruct us from understanding what the true contours of the conflict were.",
      "You have said you tried to minimize disruption to people on the ground. But do you really think that having two members of Congress show up unexpectedly during a perilous time in Kabul did not distract and divert resources from the mission at hand?",
      "Mr. Meijer: We had planned to have no requirement for any support by any governmental entity.",
      "We had hoped \u2014 and were successful \u2014 in briefly talking with a number of leaders on the ground, but also wanted to talk to individuals who weren\u2019t in the highest leadership positions, to get that sense of ground truth.",
      "Mr. Moulton: We actually apologized to people for showing up unexpected, and several people said, \u2018This is great, because we didn\u2019t have to do anything to prepare for it.\u2019",
      "We said, \u2018We do not want to take any resources away from you.\u2019 So we were assigned to people to take us to the gate, both of whom we were told were not doing anything because their work is during the night. And so we did that during the daytime, and at night, we sat in an office in the headquarters, so that we wouldn\u2019t be a burden.",
      "At the end of the day, the impact of our visit on ongoing operations, I believe, will pale in comparison to the impact of the visit.",
      "Walk me through what you saw when you first got to the airport.",
      "Mr. Meijer: There were I think close to 20,000 individuals who were waiting on flights out a day or two before we arrived. When we were there, the Air Force and the other personnel on the ground had so efficiently moved those individuals to intermediate staging locations that there were some people there, but it was by no means an overwhelming number waiting for flights. It was probably in the few hundreds.",
      "Mr. Moulton: This is one of the most complicated operations that the U.S. military has done in decades. It\u2019s so bad because the administration did not follow our advice for months and start the evacuation earlier. But in the space of a few days, the Marines and soldiers in Kabul have turned this from utter chaos into an orderly evacuation \u2014 or at least as orderly as you can hope for in this truly crazy environment.",
      "What are some of the takeaways that you want to share with your colleagues in Congress and the broader public?",
      "Mr. Moulton: Almost every veteran in Congress wants to extend the Aug. 31 deadline, including us, and our opinion on that was changed on the ground, because we started the evacuations so late. There\u2019s no way we can get everyone out, even by Sept. 11. So we need to have a working relationship with the Taliban after our departure. And the only way to achieve that is to leave by Aug. 31.",
      "Mr. Meijer: It is utterly bizarre and baffling that we\u2019re in this position. To go from having the Taliban as an adversary we\u2019re seeking to kill, to relying upon them for security, coordinating to make sure things run smoothly. It\u2019s a complicated situation that\u2019s impossible to understand if you\u2019re not on the ground and yet critical to saving the lives of tens of thousands.",
      "There are tireless diplomatic officials there who have been working around the clock to clear backlogs, to work on the permissions needed to land in order to make sure all of this goes smoothly.",
      "Mr. Moulton: In fact, one of the critical things we learned from our visit is that the task force prioritizing all the [special immigrant visa] applicants is overwhelmed by requests from members of Congress. That\u2019s never been communicated to us, but that is something that we are now communicating to our colleagues.",
      "Did you speak with commanders on the ground about what can be done to help Americans and our Afghan allies who are not in Kabul get to the airport?",
      "Mr. Meijer: The commanders on the ground have assembled an array of options. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics. But the important thing to communicate is the way in which those forces will move heaven and earth to rescue American citizens who are stranded. And there are American citizens who are stranded, despite what the White House press secretary would like to say. They have developed actionable plans for that.",
      "Mr. Moulton: But the other thing to emphasize is that at the end of the day, we don\u2019t have time to get everyone. That\u2019s why our ongoing relationship with the Taliban is so important.",
      "Mr. Meijer: At those gates, that\u2019s where it\u2019s just incredibly chaotic, incredibly heartbreaking \u2014 to see individuals with that level of desperation, begging to be rescued.",
      "Something I think people need to know is that there is no scenario that trains a soldier or Marine to take somebody in a wheelchair, and have to push them back out because they don\u2019t meet the paperwork criteria. I think we both are just incredibly concerned.",
      "Mr. Moulton: It\u2019s the most extraordinary thing I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. I\u2019ve never been more proud to be an American than after witnessing the soldiers and Marines. They\u2019re navigating conflicts of humanity.",
      "Mr. Meijer: But they\u2019re going to need help after.",
      "Mr. Moulton: I\u2019ve never talked to more public servants \u2014 from salty Marines to the most seasoned State Department officials \u2014 who came to tears describing their work."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Education Department has initiated investigations into five states whose prohibitions on universal mask mandates in schools may run afoul of civil rights laws protecting students with disabilities, federal officials announced Monday.",
      "The department\u2019s civil rights head wrote to state education leaders in Iowa, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah, notifying them that the department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights would determine whether the prohibitions are restricting access for students who are protected under federal law from discrimination based on their disabilities, and are entitled to a free appropriate public education.",
      "The investigations make good on the Biden administration\u2019s promise to use the federal government\u2019s muscle \u2014 including civil rights investigations and legal action \u2014 to intervene in states where governors and other policymakers have come out against mask mandates in public schools. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone in schools wear masks, regardless of vaccination status.",
      "In letters to state leaders, the acting assistant secretary for civil rights said the department would explore whether the prohibitions \u201cmay be preventing schools from meeting their legal obligations not to discriminate based on disability and from providing an equal educational opportunity to students with disabilities who are at heightened risk of severe illness from Covid-19.\u201d",
      "The department said it has not opened investigations in Florida, Texas, Arkansas or Arizona because those states\u2019 bans on universal indoor masking are not being enforced in schools because of litigation or other state action.",
      "On Friday, a Florida court rejected an effort by Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, and other state officials to prevent mask mandates in schools.",
      "Sydnee Dickson, Utah\u2019s superintendent of public instruction, said in a statement on Monday that while she appreciated the federal department\u2019s efforts to protect children, she believed \u201cthey have unfairly defined Utah as a state where mask mandates cannot occur.\u201d",
      "She said that the state\u2019s law left the decision up to local officials, and that several counties had implemented them. She noted that the C.D.C., in March, studied a Utah district as an example of how elementary schools had reopened without significant outbreaks.",
      "Oklahoma and South Carolina education officials signaled that they opposed their states\u2019 prohibitions on mask mandates.",
      "Joy Hofmeister, Oklahoma\u2019s superintendent of public instruction, said in a statement that the State Department of Education planned to cooperate with the investigation. Oklahoma\u2019s law against mask mandates \u201cis preventing schools from fulfilling their legal duty to protect and provide all students the opportunity to learn more safely in person,\u201d she said.",
      "In a statement, the South Carolina Department of Education said that the state superintendent \u201chas repeatedly implored the legislature to reconsider\u201d a recently passed proviso on mask mandates, which it said was being challenged in court.",
      "The department said it \u201cis particularly sensitive to the law\u2019s effect on South Carolina\u2019s most vulnerable students.\u201d",
      "Brian Symmes, the communications director for Gov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina, wrote in a statement that the federal investigation by the Education Department was \u201canother attempt by the Biden administration to force a radical liberal agenda on states and people who disagree with them.\u201d",
      "He continued, \u201cUnder South Carolina law, anybody who wants to wear a mask \u2014 in a school setting or elsewhere \u2014 is free to do so, but the governor isn\u2019t going to ignore a parent\u2019s fundamental right to make health decisions for their children.\u201d",
      "Officials in the education departments of Iowa and Tennessee acknowledged they received and were reviewing their letters.",
      "Earlier this month, President Biden announced he had directed his education secretary, Miguel A. Cardona, to use the agency\u2019s broad power to intervene in states where governors had blocked mask mandates.",
      "Dr. Cardona has said he is particularly perturbed by prohibitions in places where the Delta variant of the coronavirus has sent cases surging. He said that he has heard from desperate parents who fear sending their immunocompromised and medically vulnerable children into schools that do not have universal masking.",
      "This month, parents of children with disabilities sued Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican, over his ban on mask mandates in public schools, arguing that his order prevented their medically at-risk children from being able to attend school safely.",
      "\u201cThe department has heard from parents from across the country \u2014 particularly parents of students with disabilities and with underlying medical conditions \u2014 about how state bans on universal indoor masking are putting their children at risk,\u201d Dr. Cardona said in a statement announcing the investigations.",
      "Millions of public school children qualify for special education services that often require hands-on instruction and other services and therapies. And the population has been a priority to get back into classrooms after experiencing steep academic and social setbacks as a result of school closures during the pandemic.",
      "The department will specifically look at whether the state bans violate Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which includes \u201cthe right of students with disabilities to receive their education in the regular educational environment, alongside their peers without disabilities, to the maximum extent appropriate to their needs,\u201d the department said.",
      "It will also look at whether statewide prohibitions violate Title II of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, which prohibits disability discrimination by public entities.",
      "The department said the investigations are not indicative of a violation, which could result in a state losing federal funding. Most investigations result in resolution agreements between the agency and the state."

    "content": [
      "DENVER \u2014 Joe Saboe pressed his fingers against his brow in exhaustion and leaned over a laptop as he tried to do what had been drilled into him over and over when he was an Army infantry officer: Leave no one behind.",
      "\u201cRoger, I\u2019ve got six AmCits, at least six,\u201d he said into his cellphone, using shorthand for American citizens, while simultaneously texting with a military source in Kabul, Afghanistan. \u201cI can get them to the rally point at wheels up, but they\u2019re not going to leave without their families, I need to make that happen.\u201d",
      "Mr. Saboe, 36, deployed to Iraq years ago and now is the chief executive of a small start-up and a youth soccer coach. But this past week he became an unofficial commander in an impromptu network of veterans and citizen volunteers who came together to execute an ad hoc mission to get American citizens and Afghan allies safely out of Kabul before the American airlift ends.",
      "His group of about 200 volunteers, which calls itself Team America, is one of several grass-roots efforts that sprang out of the chaos of the U.S. withdrawal. The swift collapse of Afghanistan was deeply troubling to many in the United States, but military veterans felt a whole different level of anguish as they started getting pleas for help from Afghan interpreters and others they worked with.",
      "They organized what many call a \u201cdigital Dunkirk.\u201d Using software often designed for mundane office work, along with satellite maps and encrypted messaging apps, the groups act like guide services for escaping Afghans. They channel information to hundreds on the ground trying to get on a flight, providing real-time intelligence on the best routes to avoid Taliban checkpoints, sending them through overlooked alleys and sometimes through sewage canals.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really an underground railroad,\u201d Scott Mann, a retired Army Special Forces officer leading a different group, which calls itself Task Force Pineapple, said in a video message to supporters on Thursday.",
      "In many cases, the groups are in contact with the military and State Department officials at the Kabul airport, alerting them when American citizens and green card holders arrive and providing physical descriptions so troops at the gates can pluck the evacuees out of the throng.",
      "Together, these groups have helped thousands to safety.",
      "\u201cThis was born out of desperation,\u201d Mr. Saboe said as he scrolled through his latest list of Afghans trying to get out. \u201cA lot of us knew people who needed to get out, and there was no one in the American government who seemed to be giving any guidance. There has been almost no coordination.\u201d",
      "It was 1 a.m. in Kabul, and in his home office on a suburban street of white picket fences, running on almost no sleep, he was coordinating a covert pickup from a neighborhood 7,200 miles away.",
      "The group\u2019s secure digital feed was full of photos and videos sent by Afghans coordinating movements and posting the current conditions at gates and checkpoints, but Mr. Saboe was guarded about specific methods and routes, saying he did not want to endanger people who still needed help.",
      "On Thursday, suicide bomb blasts hit one of the airport gates. Before the attack, Team America had acted on intelligence warnings and moved 300 family groups back from the area. But others had stayed near the airport and been injured. A few hours later, the group got word from a military source that the gate was open again, and began coordinating between an official inside the airport and families preparing to make an attempt to get there.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll give you the grid. The lift is coming for them at 0400, so we need them to be ready, immediate family only, they won\u2019t take anyone else,\u201d Mr. Saboe said on a conference call to a small group of volunteers scattered across the country who were communicating directly with Afghan families.",
      "One member of the group asked about interpreters who had special immigrant visas but were not citizens. There were hundreds waiting for rescue.",
      "Mr. Saboe shook his head. \u201cThey aren\u2019t taking them, AmCits only. As far as I know, they are cutting sling on the rest.\u201d",
      "One of the people trying to get out of Kabul this past week was Nemat, who worked for years as an interpreter for the Marine Corps. He got a green card in 2015 and is now attending college in Texas, but he was visiting family in Kabul when the Taliban took over.",
      "\u201cI was scared to death,\u201d he said. \u201cIf any of the Taliban recognized me, it would be the end of my life.\u201d",
      "Civilian flights out of the country were canceled. Nemat, who did not want to use his last name because he feared retaliation by the Taliban, stripped off his American clothes and put on a traditional Afghan long shirt and turban. He hid the paperwork showing he worked with the United States in a well. He tried to contact the State Department but got no response, so he texted the Marines he used to work with.",
      "His message reached Rich Porter, a project manager in North Carolina who had served with him as a Marine officer.",
      "\u201cThe terps we worked with are heroes; we could not have done our mission without them,\u201d Mr. Porter said, using a military shorthand for interpreter. \u201cWe knew we had to help in any way we could.\u201d",
      "Mr. Porter found Team America, and together sources were able to guide Nemat on the safest route to the airport. He passed through Taliban checkpoints with his American passport hidden in his mother\u2019s clothes and arrived at an airport gate.",
      "\u201cMy brother pushed me through the crowd, I was holding up my passport and the Marines pulled me over the wire,\u201d Nemat said on Thursday. \u201cI looked back and saw my mother crying, my brother, too. I am happy to be safe but I am very worried for them.\u201d",
      "Mr. Porter was so thankful for the work the group had done for Nemat that he joined the effort and is now helping others.",
      "\u201cIt is the least we can do,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are people who saved American lives.\u201d",
      "Zohra Hunter also joined the group after it helped her family, which had a pending special immigrant visa.",
      "\u201cThey had already made two attempts to get to the airport, and gotten beaten by the Taliban and shot at,\u201d said Ms. Hunter, an American citizen who was born in Afghanistan but now lives in Virginia. Two of her sister\u2019s children and her mother were trampled at one of the gates and injured, she said.",
      "Finally, with Team America coordinating with the military on the ground, the family got on a sanctioned shuttle to the airport and was let through a gate.",
      "Her relatives are now in Qatar. She is unsure where they will go next.",
      "The groups trying to rescue Afghans are growing increasingly desperate as the Aug. 31 pullout draws near. Many have pushed for the deadline to be extended, but on Thursday, in the wake of bombings that killed 13 United States military members and more than 170 Afghans, President Biden reiterated that he would hold to the date.",
      "Early Friday morning, Team America guided a group of 40 Afghans, many of them American citizens, to a gate at the airport. When they arrived, Mr. Saboe said, American officials refused to let them in, directing them to another, more dangerous gate. After several frantic calls, Mr. Saboe was able to talk directly to an official at the original gate. There, 19 Afghans went through. Many of their family members were turned away.",
      "\u201cThere is no mercy at this point; it\u2019s becoming increasingly hard. Nothing is coordinated and the security situation has made everything worse,\u201d Mr. Saboe said, sounding exhausted. \u201cAnd we still have so many people waiting. We just need more time.\u201d"

Some were thankful that America\u2019s involvement in the country seemed to have ended, but were also dismayed that hard-won progress was squandered. Others were fearful for Afghan friends left behind.",
      "In interviews, text messages and on Facebook, men and women who collectively spent decades in Afghanistan said they were angry that despite a drawdown that has spanned years, the United States could not manage to exit the country with more dignity.",
      "The anguish can be especially raw because veterans often worked side by side with Afghans during the years of attempts at nation-building, and now in that nation\u2019s collapse they see the individual faces of friends who have been enveloped by the anarchy.",

      "At the time, she thought efforts to stabilize Afghanistan were succeeding, and American troops would one day leave the country a better place. But her optimism slowly wore down as the Taliban gained ground.",

I hate to see it end like this, but you don\u2019t know what else we could have done,\u201d she said in an interview from her home in Louisville, Ky. \u201cDo we have an expectation that U.S. service members should stay and fight the Taliban when the Afghan Army won\u2019t?\u201d",

But bottlenecks in the system, and President Biden\u2019s insistence that all troops leave the country by the end of the month, may prevent the military from keeping that pace.",
      "The race against time means that the 5,800 Marines and soldiers at Hamid Karzai International Airport must try to evacuate thousands more Americans and Afghan allies, and then get themselves out, somehow erasing the detritus of 20 years of war in Afghanistan in the next seven days.",

      "But for all of Mr. Biden\u2019s insistence on sticking to his withdrawal deadline, neither the Department of Homeland Security nor the State Department has been able to ratchet up the vetting and processing times to the levels needed to meet demand.",
      "A U.S. official said it was taking as long as 12 hours for immigration officers at Al Udeid Air Base outside Doha, Qatar, to check arriving Afghans against the National Counterterrorism Center\u2019s watch list. The official said that vetting and screening processes needed to move faster to prevent the evacuee pipeline from clogging up again at Al Udeid, the largest base receiving Afghans, as it did for several hours last week.",
      "The Taliban have warned of \u201cconsequences\u201d if the U.S. military stays beyond the deadline. And on Tuesday, a Taliban spokesman said the group\u2019s fighters would physically block Afghans from going to the airport.",
      "The Pentagon has opened military bases in Virginia, Texas, Wisconsin and New Jersey to provide temporary housing for Afghan refugees, and will probably add more in the coming days, officials said.",
      "Mr. Kirby said Afghan allies of the United States, who fear reprisals from the Taliban, are still being processed at the Kabul airport, although the gates of the airport have been shuttered several times over the past week because of the surge of people.",
      "The United States will continue to evacuate Afghans until the last couple of days of its drawdown of troops and equipment, when flights are expected to be filled mostly with military troops and equipment, as well as any Americans desiring to leave. Dozens of Afghan commandos \u2014 trained by the United States \u2014 are also at the airport and must be evacuated.",
      "For the military, part of the problem is the sheer scale of moving so many people so quickly, with so little advanced notice. For instance, the C-17 military planes, which are transporting 400 people per load, have one or two bathrooms on them, and the flight from Kabul to Qatar is four hours.",
      "Once the flights arrive at Al Udeid in Qatar and other intermediate bases in the Middle East and Europe, evacuees are vetted by Homeland Security and State Department officials, who determine if they qualify to enter the United States.",
      "The military is treating the Taliban\u2019s red line on Aug. 31 seriously in part because, despite tough talk from Taliban spokesmen, some of the group\u2019s commanders have been cooperating with the U.S. military and allowing many people to get to the airport. In addition, the American military and the Taliban have cooperated against the threat of attacks from the Islamic State.",
      "But after Aug. 31, all bets are off, a senior U.S. official said.",
      "With so many people at the Kabul airport, in Doha and at other bases, concerns are rising about sanitation, food and water. The C-17 planes taking refugees out of Afghanistan are turning around and bringing in extra dumpsters, portable hand-washing stations, refrigerated trucks to keep water cool, and food and water.",
      "Over the past four days, Defense Department officials said, three babies were born to evacuees. One woman went into labor on Saturday during a flight landing at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, Air Force officials said. The aircraft commander descended to a lower altitude to increase air pressure in the jet, a decision that officials said saved the mother\u2019s life because she had low blood pressure. When the plane landed, medics rushed aboard and delivered the baby \u2014 a girl \u2014 in the cargo bay. All three babies are in good condition, Mr. Kirby said Tuesday.",
      "After receiving a classified briefing Monday night, Representative Adam B. Schiff, a California Democrat who heads the House Intelligence Committee, said the Aug. 31 deadline for withdrawing U.S. troops from Kabul was unrealistic.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s possible, but I think it\u2019s very unlikely,\u201d Mr. Schiff told reporters. Using the abbreviation for special immigrant visas, he added, \u201cGiven the number of Americans who still need to be evacuated, the number of S.I.V.s, the number of others who are members of the Afghan press, civil society leaders, women leaders \u2014 it\u2019s hard for me to imagine all of that can be accomplished between now and the end of the month.\u201d"

    "title": "U.S. to Advise Boosters for Most Americans 8 Months After Vaccination",
    "content": [
      "The Biden administration has decided that most Americans should get a coronavirus booster vaccination eight months after they received their second shot, and could begin offering third shots as early as the third week of September, according to administration officials familiar with the discussions.",
      "Officials are planning to announce the decision on Wednesday at the White House. Their goal is to let Americans who received the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines know now that they will need additional protection against the Delta variant, which is causing caseloads to surge across much of the nation. But the new policy will depend on the Food and Drug Administration authorizing additional shots.",
      "Recipients of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which was authorized as a one-dose regimen, will also most likely require an additional dose, the officials said. But they are waiting for results, expected this month, from a clinical trial that provided participants with two doses. So far, only about 14 million people in the United States have gotten the Johnson & Johnson shot, which the government began offering in March. The first Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were given in December.",
      "The first boosters would probably go to nursing home residents, health care workers and emergency workers, who were the first to be vaccinated last winter. They would likely be followed by other older people, then by the general population. Officials envision giving people the same vaccine they originally received.",
      "Some five million people in the United States \u2014 everyone who got two doses of Pfizer or Moderna vaccine by the end of January \u2014 would be eligible for boosters by late September under the plan. In all, more than 90 million people in the country have been fully vaccinated with Pfizer\u2019s product, and more than 64 million with Moderna\u2019s. But about 40 percent of the population has still not gotten even a first dose, a problem the administration will need to stay focused on even as it turns to providing boosters.",
      "Administration officials are expected to make the case Wednesday that even if the booster plan shifts based on new data, it is prudent to have a strategy in place now.",
      "White House officials are expected to present data showing that the vaccines\u2019 protection against Covid-19 infections is declining \u2014 a trend they attribute to a combination of the Delta variant and a degree of waning in the vaccines\u2019 protection. Unvaccinated people still make up the vast majority of those who become seriously ill or are hospitalized with Covid-19.",
      "The announcement comes as the Biden administration is struggling to regain control of a pandemic that it had claimed to have tamed little more than a month ago. President Biden had declared the nation reopened for normal life for the July 4 holiday, but the wildfire spread of the Delta variant has thwarted that. Covid-19 patients are again overwhelming hospitals in some states, and federal officials are worried about an increase in the number of children hospitalized just as the school year is set to begin.",
      "For hospitals and state and local governments, having to manage a new round of vaccinations amid the Delta surge adds another layer of complication to the response, said Dr. Janis M. Orlowski, chief health officer of the Association of American Medical Colleges, which represents 400 of the nation\u2019s largest teaching hospitals.",
      "Before vaccinating health care workers, Dr. Orlowski said, hospitals will want data about side effects from booster shots, so they can know how to stagger vaccinations among their staff without hurting their ability to care for patients. \u201cYou can\u2019t do the whole I.C.U. at the same time,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause you don\u2019t want everyone getting fever and chills.\u201d",
      "In interviews on Tuesday, hospital officials and doctors generally supported the push for booster shots. Unlike the vaccination campaign that began last winter, they said, this time there will be enough doses to go around, which should make things move more smoothly.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re running out of second chances,\u201d said Dr. Matthew Harris, the medical director of the coronavirus vaccination program at Northwell Health, New York\u2019s largest hospital system. \u201cWhat keeps me up at night is the inevitability of a variant that is not responsive to the vaccine, so if this is how we stay ahead of it, I fully support it.\u201d",
      "Dr. Danny Avula, Virginia\u2019s vaccine coordinator, said his state has thousands of vaccine providers in place and can likely manage boosters without much change. \u201cWhat caused so much of the urgency and frenzy of January through April was the limitations in supply,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it will be a very different rollout for booster than it was for the initial shots.\u201d",
      "The booster strategy has been under discussion for several weeks, but a consensus about how to proceed was reached in meetings only this weekend. Officials said senior health officials all endorsed it, including the surgeon general, Dr. Vivek H. Murthy, and the leaders of the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The administration has more than 100 million doses stockpiled that could be used for boosters, plus the tens of millions more in freezers at pharmacies and other locations. The administration has purchased still more supply scheduled for delivery this fall, and officials say they are not worried about running out.",
      "Federal health officials have been particularly concerned about data from Israel suggesting that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine\u2019s protection against severe disease has fallen significantly for elderly people who got their second shot in January or February.",
      "Israel can in some ways be viewed as a template for the United States because it vaccinated more of its population faster and has almost exclusively used the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine that made up much of the U.S. stock. Unlike the United States, though, Israel has a nationalized health care system that allows it to systematically track patients.",
      "The latest Israeli data, posted on the government\u2019s website, shows what some experts described as continued erosion of the efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against mild or asymptomatic Covid-19 infections in general and against severe disease among the elderly who were vaccinated early in the year.",
      "One slide suggests that for those age 65 or older who got their second shots in January, the vaccine is now only about 55 percent effective against severe disease. But researchers noted that the data has a wide margin of error, and some said other Israeli government data suggested the decline was less severe.",
      "\u201cIt shows a pretty steep decline in effectiveness against infection, but it\u2019s still a bit murky about protection against severe disease,\u201d said Dr. Peter J. Hotez, a vaccine expert at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, who reviewed the data at the request of The New York Times.",
      "Federal officials said the booster program would most likely follow much the same scenario as the initial vaccination program. The first shots for the general public in the United States were administered on Dec. 14, days after the F.D.A. authorized the Pfizer shot for emergency use. People started receiving the Moderna vaccine a week later.",
      "It is not clear how quickly the F.D.A. could rule on booster shots.",
      "Pfizer is further along in submitting data to the F.D.A. that it says supports the use of extra doses. Moderna and the National Institutes of Health are still studying whether a half-dose or a full dose would work better for a third shot but expect results soon. Both companies expect to complete their submissions of booster data soon.",
      "An advisory committee on vaccines for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would need to review the data on boosters before the C.D.C. can recommend them.",
      "The World Health Organization has called for a moratorium on booster shots until the end of September, saying available doses should be used to help countries that are far behind in vaccinations. But Israel is already offering third shots to those at least 50 years old. Germany and France have said they plan to offer additional shots to vulnerable segments of their populations next month. Britain has a plan to do so, but is holding off for now.",
      "Late last week, the F.D.A. authorized third doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for certain people with weakened immune systems, and the C.D.C. recommended them. The authorities decided those individuals, who make up fewer than 3 percent of Americans, merited extra shots because many fail to respond to the standard dosage. The agency has not yet authorized any of the vaccines for children younger than 12."

    "title": "Intelligence Review Yields No Firm Conclusion on Origins of Coronavirus",
    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 American intelligence agencies have not been able to determine if the coronavirus pandemic was the result of an accidental leak from a lab or if it emerged more naturally, according to declassified portions of a report to the White House that were released on Friday.",
      "The nation\u2019s spy agencies, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said, are unlikely to reach a conclusion without more cooperation from China or new sources of information.",
      "In a statement, President Biden said the United States would continue working to understand the origins of the virus and he called on China to be more transparent about what led to its emergence there in late 2019 before spreading rapidly across the globe.",
      "\u201cWe will do everything we can to trace the roots of this outbreak that has caused so much pain and death around the world, so that we can take every necessary precaution to prevent it from happening again,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cCritical information about the origins of this pandemic exists in the People\u2019s Republic of China, yet from the beginning, government officials in China have worked to prevent international investigators and members of the global public health community from accessing it.\u201d",
      "As debates about the pandemic\u2019s origins and China\u2019s role intensified, Mr. Biden ordered the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies three months ago to draft a report on the source of the virus.",
      "After the review, the National Intelligence Council and four other intelligence agencies reported that they believed the virus that causes Covid-19 was most likely created by \u201cnatural exposure to an infected animal through an animal infected with it, or close progenitor virus.\u201d",
      "Before the review was conducted, only two agencies favored the natural exposure theory. But the new report said the intelligence council and other agencies favoring the natural theory had only low confidence in their conclusions \u2014 a sign that the intelligence behind the determination was not strong and that assessments could change.",
      "On the other side of the debate, one agency said it had concluded, with moderate confidence, that the pandemic was the result of \u201ca laboratory-associated incident\u201d in China. According to the declassified report, analysts at that agency gave weight to the risky nature of work on coronaviruses. The agency also said the accident most likely involved \u201cexperimentation, animal handling or sampling by the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\u201d",
      "There were two labs in Wuhan doing work on the coronavirus before the pandemic, but intelligence agencies have mostly focused on the work done at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.",
      "The announcement from the director of national intelligence did not identify the agency that favored the laboratory-leak theory. But current and former officials said the F.B.I. believed that the virus was created in the lab. One former official said the bureau believed the virus probably escaped into the public from lab technicians.",
      "An F.B.I. spokeswoman declined to comment.",
      "The intelligence agencies all agreed that the virus was unlikely to have been created as any kind of biological weapon, the same stance the U.S. government has maintained for more than a year. The agencies also agreed that the initial exposures that caused the outbreak occurred \u201cno later than November 2019,\u201d according to the declassified conclusions.",
      "Critical to the debate over the origins of the virus, American intelligence officials do not believe the Chinese officials knew about it at the time of the outbreak, the report said.",
      "\u201cThe I.C. assesses China\u2019s officials did not have foreknowledge of the virus before the initial outbreak of Covid-19 emerged,\u201d the declassified report said, using the initials for the intelligence community.",
      "The three-month review Mr. Biden ordered was done to bring more scientific expertise into the examination of the pandemic\u2019s origins. Intelligence agencies used that period to examine a trove of data that had not been fully scrutinized.",
      "That data, taken from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, did not provide any additional information that persuaded additional agencies that a lab leak was possible.",
      "The key piece of missing data, according to intelligence officials, is clinical virus samples from early cases in China.",
      "Neither American intelligence officers, nor scientists around the world, have samples of the virus from the earliest known cases. That includes samples from a group of three Wuhan laboratory workers who became hospitalized with flulike symptoms last January.",
      "Obtaining virus samples from early cases in China could help identify \u201ca location of interest\u201d or \u201coccupational exposure,\u201d the declassified report said.",
      "Some American officials believe China has more access to such samples than it has been willing to share. The reluctance to cooperate has raised suspicions among some analysts.",
      "American intelligence officials do not believe the Chinese government necessarily knows how the virus was created, but some think officials in Beijing are worried about what a real investigation would discover and have moved to block the World Health Organization and others from a full inquiry.",
      "\u201cThese actions reflect, in part, China\u2019s government\u2019s own uncertainty about where an investigation could lead as well as its frustration the international community is using the issue to exert political pressure on China,\u201d the declassified report said.",
      "The investigation of the theory that the virus was accidentally created in the lab has made some people uneasy, especially those who believe the accusation is racist.",
      "Sonal Shah, the president of the Asian American Foundation, warned against allowing the examination of the origins of the pandemic to increase the risk of violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.",
      "\u201cEven though the administration\u2019s report today contains no clear conclusions, it will likely breed misinformation,\u201d she said.",
      "Others have defended the examination and said that neither theory is inherently racist. They have argued that a clearer understanding of the pandemic\u2019s origins can help prevent a future global health crisis.",
      "Mr. Biden said the United States would keep working with other nations and the World Health Organization to get access to more information from China.",
      "\u201cWe must have a full and transparent accounting of this global tragedy,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing less is acceptable.\u201d"

      "For more information on evolving travel restrictions in Europe and elsewhere, see our up-to-date list of countries that U.S. travelers may visit here.",
      "On Monday, the European Union removed the United States from its \u201csafe list\u201d of countries whose residents can travel to its 27 member states without requirements such as quarantine and testing. This generated confusion, with some people writing on social media that Americans have been banned from visiting Europe. That\u2019s not actually what the recommendation means.",
      "Americans have not been explicitly prohibited from going anywhere in Europe. But as of Tuesday, at least one country had put new restrictions on travelers depending on their vaccination status: Italy said it would require unvaccinated travelers to quarantine for five days; vaccinated travelers must take a test for the coronavirus before entering. Here\u2019s a look at what the new developments mean for vaccinated and unvaccinated people:",
      "Since June, the United States has been on the European Union\u2019s safe list for travel, which cleared the way for American travelers to visit many E.U. member countries without quarantining. In addition to taking the United States off the safe list on Monday, the European Council, the European Union\u2019s governing body, released a recommendation urging member countries to issue travel restrictions for visitors from the United States who are unvaccinated against the coronavirus. The European Union is encouraging authorities across Europe to reinstate the sort of mandatory quarantine and testing requirements that seemed to be on their way out, though primarily for unvaccinated travelers.",
      "Ultimately it\u2019s up to a given country to decide if it wants to issue new requirements, however.",
      "The first notable changes were announced Tuesday, by Italy. Even if visitors are vaccinated, they must now obtain a negative coronavirus test 72 hours before arrival. Previously, some airlines, such as Delta Air Lines, required this, but the Italian government did not.",
      "In general, though, if you are fully vaccinated with an E.U.-approved vaccine, which include those manufactured by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson, the requirements you face entering an E.U. country are unlikely to change significantly. Many member states have already been urging travelers to bring proof of vaccination and waiving quarantine requirements for those who can show proof of vaccination.",
      "Countries beyond Italy could decide to add new restrictions, but it\u2019s unclear how many will. Still, you\u2019d be wise to have your Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccine record card handy no matter where you are headed.",
      "Under Italy\u2019s newly announced policy, unvaccinated American travelers will now have to \u201cself-isolate\u201d for five days upon arrival in the country according to the Italian National Tourist Board.",
      "Previously, unvaccinated visitors from the United States needed to take a coronavirus test 48 hours before touching down in Italy, but they did not have to quarantine.",
      "As of Tuesday afternoon, it was not yet clear how the new recommendation would change travel beyond Italy.",
      "Tom Milanovic, a marketing manager for the Spanish tourism authority, said that many worried people had called him on Monday, wondering if they had to cancel upcoming trips. But so far, the European Union\u2019s recommendation has not altered Spain\u2019s requirements even for unvaccinated travelers, he said.",
      "\u201cAny U.S. citizen regardless of their status is still good to go,\u201d he said, adding that the country issues new guidelines each week. The current guidelines, which hold until Sept. 5, continue to categorize the United States as \u201clow risk,\u201d meaning Americans don\u2019t have to show a negative antigen test before flying to Spain.",
      "Tourism authorities from several other countries said that they were not at liberty to discuss the new requirements, but as far as they were aware, the European Union\u2019s recommendation did not change anything immediately.",
      "No, but it underscores how quickly rules and regulations continue to change. Unvaccinated travelers should be prepared to keep hitting refresh on the entry requirements for their chosen location until the moment they set out to the airport. It\u2019s also worth remembering that long before this recommendation, some countries were already requiring unvaccinated travelers to quarantine.",
      "If children are too young to get vaccinated, then the new recommendation does not affect them, a European Union official said.",
      "The new recommendation makes an exception for essential travel.",
      "No, this does not change anything yet. There is no guarantee that the person sitting next to you on your flight has been vaccinated.",
      "You can certainly try.",
      "Kate Kilcoyne, a travel adviser for All-Travel, a Los Angeles-based travel agency, said that it\u2019s too soon to know how airlines and cruises will respond to this new development, but her clients have generally had more success receiving credits rather than cash refunds when canceling their travel plans.",
      "Tammy O\u2019Hara, a travel agent for Million Miles Travel Agency, a boutique company based in New York, echoed this point. Most hotels, she has found, are more willing than airlines to offer full refunds, she added.",
      "Standard travel insurance may not be all that helpful, said Svetlana Stein, the president of L&B Travel, L.L.C., an agency in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cCovid-19 is now considered a foreseen situation and is often not accepted as a covered reason for cancellation,\u201d she said. Ms. Stein urged travelers to buy insurance that offers a \u201ccancel for any reason\u201d feature for this reason."

    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 For months, Apple and Google have been fighting a bill in the South Korean legislature that they say could imperil their lucrative app store businesses. The companies have appealed directly to South Korean lawmakers, government officials and the public to try to block the legislation, which is expected to face a crucial vote this week.",
      "The companies have also turned to an unlikely ally, one that is also trying to quash their power: the United States government. A group funded by the companies has urged trade officials in Washington to push back on the legislation, arguing that targeting American firms could violate a joint trade agreement.",
      "The South Korean legislation would be the first law in the world to require companies that operate app stores to let users pay for in-app purchases using a variety of payment systems. It would also prohibit blocking developers from listing their products on other app stores.",
      "How the White House responds to this proposal poses an early test for the Biden administration: Will it defend tech companies facing antitrust scrutiny abroad while it applies that same scrutiny to the companies at home?",
      "Washington has a longstanding practice of opposing foreign laws that discriminate against American firms, sometimes even when doing so conflicts with domestic policy debates. But President Biden wants a consistent approach to his concerns about the tech giants\u2019 incredible power over commerce, communications and news. In July he signed an executive order to spur competition in the industry, and his top two antitrust appointees have long been vocal critics of the companies.",
      "The approach the White House chooses may have widespread implications for the industry, and for the shape of the internet around the world. A growing number of countries are pursuing stricter regulations on Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon, fragmenting the rules of the global internet.",
      "American officials have echoed some of the industry\u2019s complaints about the proposal, saying in a March report it appeared to target American companies. But trade officials have yet to take a formal position on it, said Adam Hodge, a spokesman for the United States Trade Representative. He said officials were still considering how to balance the claim that the legislation discriminates against American companies with the belief among tech critics in South Korea and America that the legislation would level the playing field.",
      "\u201cWe are engaging a range of stakeholders to gather facts as legislation is considered in Korea, recognizing the need to distinguish between discrimination against American companies and promoting competition,\u201d Mr. Hodge said in a statement.",
      "Apple said that it regularly dealt with the United States government on a range of topics. During those interactions it discussed the South Korean app store legislation with American officials, including at the U. S. Embassy in Seoul, the company said in a statement.",
      "The company said the legislation would \u201cput users who purchase digital goods from other sources at risk of fraud, undermine their privacy protections, make it difficult to manage their purchases\u201d and endanger parental controls.",
      "A Google spokeswoman, Julie Tarallo McAlister, said in a statement that Google was open to \u201cexploring alternative approaches\u201d but believed the legislation would harm consumers and software developers.",
      "The proposal was approved by a committee in the Korean National Assembly last month, over the opposition of some in the Korean government. It could get a vote in the body\u2019s judiciary committee as soon as this week. It would then require a vote from the full assembly and the signature of President Moon Jae-in to become law.",
      "The proposal would have a major impact on Apple\u2019s App Store and the Google Play Store in Korea.",
      "The Google store accounted for 75 percent of global app downloads in the second quarter of 2021, according to App Annie, an analytics company. Apple\u2019s marketplace accounted for 65 percent of consumer spending on in-app purchases or subscriptions.",
      "One way software developers make money is by selling products directly in their apps, like Fortnite\u2019s in-game currency or a subscription to The New York Times. Apple has insisted for years that developers sell those in-app products through the company\u2019s own payment system, which takes up to a 30 percent cut of many sales. Last year, Google indicated it would follow suit by applying a 30 percent cut to more purchases than it had in the past. Developers say that the fees are far too steep.",
      "After South Korean lawmakers proposed the app store bill last year, the Information Technology Industry Council, a Washington-based group that counts Apple and Google as members, urged the United States Trade Representative to include concerns about the legislation in an annual report highlighting \u201cbarriers\u201d to foreign trade. The group said in October that the rules could violate a 2007 accord that says neither country can discriminate against firms with headquarters in the other.",
      "Apple said that it was not unusual for an industry group to provide feedback to the trade representative. The company said the government had explicitly asked for comment on potentially discriminatory laws. In a statement, Naomi Wilson, the trade group\u2019s vice president of policy for Asia, said that it encouraged \u201clegislators to work with industry to re-examine the obligations for app markets set forth in the proposed measure to ensure they are not trade-restrictive and do not disproportionately affect\u201d American companies.",
      "When the trade representative\u2019s report was published in March \u2014 just weeks after Mr. Biden\u2019s nominee to the position was sworn in \u2014 it included a paragraph that echoed some of the tech group\u2019s concerns. The report concluded that the South Korean law\u2019s \u201crequirement to permit users to use outside payment services appears to specifically target U.S. providers and threatens a standard U.S. business model.\u201d",
      "The American report did not say the law would violate the free trade agreement with South Korea. But in July, the managing director of a group called the Asia Internet Coalition, which lists Apple and Google as two of its members, pointed to the report when he told Korea\u2019s trade minister that the law \u201ccould provoke trade tensions between the United States and South Korea.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Biden administration has already signaled its concerns,\u201d the director said in a written comment in July.",
      "American diplomats in Seoul also raised questions about whether the legislation could cause trade tensions.",
      "\u201cGoogle said something like that, and a similar opinion was expressed by the U.S. Embassy in Korea,\u201d said Jo Seoung Lae, a lawmaker who backs the legislation. He added that the embassy had been in touch with his staff throughout June and July. Park Sungjoong, another lawmaker, also said that the embassy had expressed trade concerns about the law.",
      "Mr. Jo said that a Google representative had visited his office to express opposition to the proposal, and that Apple had also \u201cprovided their feedback\u201d opposing the legislation.",
      "Mr. Jo said that he had requested that the United States provide its official position, but he said he had not received one yet.",
      "American trade officials sometimes defend companies even when they are criticized by others in the administration. While former President Donald J. Trump attacked a liability shield for social media platforms, known as Section 230, his trade representative wrote a similar provision into agreements with Canada, Mexico and Japan.",
      "But Wendy Cutler, a former official who negotiated the trade agreement between South Korea and the United States, said that it would be difficult for America to argue that the Korean rules violate trade agreements when the same antitrust issues are being debated stateside.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be calling out a country for potentially violating an obligation when at the same time your own government is questioning the practice,\u201d said Ms. Cutler, now the vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. \u201cIt weakens the case substantially.\u201d",
      "South Korean and American app developers have run their own campaign for the new rules, arguing it would not trigger trade tensions.",
      "In June, Mark Buse, the top lobbying executive at the dating app company Match Group and a former board member of a pro-regulation group called the Coalition for App Fairness, wrote to Mr. Jo, the Korean lawmaker, supporting the proposal. He said that the Biden administration knew about concerns around the tech giants, making trade tensions less likely.",
      "Later that month, Mr. Buse attended a virtual conference about the app store legislation hosted by K-Internet, a trade group that represents major Korean internet companies like Naver, Google\u2019s main search competitor in South Korea, and Kakao.",
      "Mr. Buse, who traveled to Seoul this month to press the case for the legislation on behalf of the Coalition for App Fairness, made it clear that his employer considered it a high-stakes debate. He listed the many other countries where officials were concerned about Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s practices.",
      "\u201cAnd all of this,\u201d he said, \u201cis following the leadership that the Korean assembly is showing.\u201d"

    "title": "Overweight Adults Should Be Screened for Diabetes at 35, Experts Say",
    "content": [
      "Overweight adults should be screened for Type 2 diabetes and abnormally high blood sugar levels starting at age 35, five years earlier than currently advised, an expert task force recommended on Tuesday.",
      "The new recommendation, which does not apply to pregnant women, comes amid cresting rates of obesity and diabetes in the United States. It means that more than 40 percent of the adult population should now be screened, according to one estimate.",
      "The guideline was issued by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which makes recommendations for preventive services and screenings that insurance companies must completely cover, without out of pocket costs to the insured, under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The task force\u2019s recommendation and a summary of the latest scientific evidence were published on Tuesday in the journal JAMA.",
      "Nearly one in seven American adults now has diabetes, the highest rate on record, a recent study found. There has been little improvement over the past decade in patients\u2019 ability to manage the condition, keeping in check their blood sugar levels, blood pressure and cholesterol.",
      "The increase is especially troubling amid the pandemic, as diabetes is one of the chronic medical conditions that increase the risk that a coronavirus infection will lead to severe illness, hospitalization or even death.",
      "Diabetes is linked to heart disease and liver disease, and it is the leading cause of kidney failure and new blindness in adults. The condition can lead to limb amputation, nerve damage and other complications.",
      "The task force said health care providers should consider screening some individuals even earlier than age 35 if they are at heightened risk. Those include people with a family history of diabetes or a personal history of conditions like gestational diabetes, and people who are Black, Hispanic, Native American, Alaska Native or Asian American.",
      "All of these groups have higher rates of diabetes than white Americans.",
      "\u201cThe Covid epidemic is really important, but we also have an epidemic of diabetes and pre-diabetes driven by the epidemic of obesity and lack of exercise,\u201d said Dr. Michael J. Barry, the vice chair of the task force who directs the informed medical decisions program at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. \u201cAll these conditions that we\u2019ve lived with for years are still out there.\u201d",
      "About one-third of U.S. adults have high blood sugar levels, a condition called pre-diabetes that often precedes Type 2 diabetes and can progress to full blown disease. Most are unaware they have the condition, which doesn\u2019t produce obvious symptoms and is why screening is essential, Dr. Barry said.",
      "Being overweight or obese is the most important risk factor for the most common type of diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, and for pre-diabetes. Lifestyle changes \u2014 including increasing physical activity, eating a healthier diet and losing even a modest amount of weight \u2014 can prevent the progression from pre-diabetes to full diabetes. (Drug treatment is also an option.)",
      "Screening generally involves a blood test to determine whether blood sugar (or glucose) is elevated. The task force called for lowering the age of first screening to 35 because that is when the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes starts to inch upward. Screening should be carried out every three years until age 70, the task force said.",
      "Dr. Tannaz Moin, an endocrinologist who co-wrote an editorial accompanying the new recommendations, said that lowering the age for screening was a step in the right direction, and that she was pleased that the guidelines emphasized the importance of detecting pre-diabetes.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more recognition that pre-diabetes is a big problem that often flies under the radar,\u201d she said. It is critical to detect pre-diabetes in younger adults, because they may live with diabetes for a long time if they develop it at a relatively young age, and will be at a greater risk of developing complications.",
      "Intensive lifestyle interventions that focus on moderate weight loss and include 150 minutes of physical activity per week can prevent or delay the onset of Type 2 diabetes in overweight or obese people with pre-diabetes. A drug, metformin, is also an option but is not as beneficial as lifestyle changes.",
      "\u201cWe have really good evidence that we can delay the onset of Type 2 diabetes if we get individuals who have pre-diabetes to do something about their risk,\u201d Dr. Moin said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same for people with Type 2 diabetes: Once we know they have it, we have a whole toolbox of things we can offer them.\u201d",
      "Rates of diabetes and pre-diabetes have increased in recent years among younger populations, including children and teenagers. Studies have shown that almost one in four adults ages 18 to 44 has pre-diabetes.",
      "Another study published on Tuesday in JAMA reported that the prevalence of both Type 1 diabetes, often called juvenile diabetes, and Type 2 diabetes, which generally starts later in life, increased in children and teenagers from 2001 to 2017, with the greatest increases among those ages 16 and over.",
      "The rate of Type 2 diabetes nearly doubled, to 0.67 per 1,000 Americans ages 10 to 19 in 2017 from 0.34 per 1,000 young people in 2001. The greatest increases were reported among Black and Hispanic youngsters.",
      "The incidence of Type 1 diabetes also increased, to 2.15 per 1,000 children and teenagers under age 19 in 2017 from 1.48 per 1,000 in 2001, with the greatest increases among white and Black children and teenagers."

    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The nation\u2019s top national security officials assembled at the Pentagon early on April 24 for a secret meeting to plan the final withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan. It was two weeks after President Biden had announced the exit over the objection of his generals, but now they were carrying out his orders.",
      "In a secure room in the building\u2019s \u201cextreme basement,\u201d two floors below ground level, Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, met with top White House and intelligence officials. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken joined by video conference. After four hours, two things were clear.",
      "First, Pentagon officials said they could pull out the remaining 3,500 American troops, almost all deployed at Bagram Air Base, by July 4 \u2014 two months earlier than the Sept. 11 deadline Mr. Biden had set. The plan would mean closing the airfield that was the American military hub in Afghanistan, but Defense Department officials did not want a dwindling, vulnerable force and the risks of service members dying in a war declared lost.",
      "Second, State Department officials said they would keep the American Embassy open, with more than 1,400 remaining Americans protected by 650 Marines and soldiers. An intelligence assessment presented at the meeting estimated that Afghan forces could hold off the Taliban for one to two years. There was brief talk of an emergency evacuation plan \u2014 helicopters would ferry Americans to the civilian airport in Kabul, the capital \u2014 but no one raised, let alone imagined, what the United States would do if the Taliban gained control of access to that airport, the only safe way in and out of the country once Bagram closed.",
      "The plan was a good one, the group concluded.",
      "Four months later, the plan is in shambles as Mr. Biden struggles to explain how a withdrawal most Americans supported went so badly wrong in its execution. On Friday, as scenes of continuing chaos and suffering at the airport were broadcast around the world, Mr. Biden went so far as to say that \u201cI cannot promise what the final outcome will be, or what it will be that it will be without risk of loss.\u201d",
      "Interviews with key participants in the last days of the war show a series of misjudgments and the failure of Mr. Biden\u2019s calculation that pulling out American troops \u2014 prioritizing their safety before evacuating American citizens and Afghan allies \u2014 would result in an orderly withdrawal.",
      "Biden administration officials consistently believed they had the luxury of time. Military commanders overestimated the will of the Afghan forces to fight for their own country and underestimated how much the American withdrawal would destroy their confidence. The administration put too much faith in President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, who fled Kabul as it fell.",
      "And although Biden White House officials say that they held more than 50 meetings on embassy security and evacuations, and that so far no Americans have died in the operation, all the planning failed to prevent the mayhem when the Taliban took over Kabul in a matter of days.",
      "Only in recent weeks did the administration change course from its original plan. By then it was too late.",
      "Five days after the April meeting at the Pentagon, General Milley told reporters on a flight back to Washington from Hawaii that the Afghan government\u2019s troops were \u201creasonably well equipped, reasonably well trained, reasonably well led.\u201d He declined to say whether they could stand on their own without support from the United States.",
      "\u201cWe frankly don\u2019t know yet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to wait and see how things develop over the summer.\u201d",
      "The president\u2019s top intelligence officers echoed that uncertainty, privately offering concerns about the Afghan abilities. But they still predicted that a complete Taliban takeover was not likely for at least 18 months. One senior administration official, discussing classified intelligence information that had been presented to Mr. Biden, said there was no sense that the Taliban were on the march.",
      "In fact, they were. Across Afghanistan the Taliban were methodically gathering strength by threatening tribal leaders in every community they entered with warnings to surrender or die. They collected weapons, ammunition, volunteers and money as they stormed from town to town, province to province.",
      "In May, they launched a major offensive in Helmand Province in the south and six other areas of Afghanistan, including Ghazni and Kandahar. Back in Washington, refugee groups grew increasingly alarmed by what was happening on the ground and feared Taliban retribution against thousands of translators, interpreters and others who had helped the American war effort.",
      "Leaders of the groups estimated that as many as 100,000 Afghans and family members were now targets for Taliban revenge. On May 6, representatives from several of the United States\u2019 largest refugee groups, including Human Rights First, the International Refugee Assistance Project, No One Left Behind, and the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service logged onto Zoom for a call with National Security Council staff members.",
      "The groups pleaded with the White House officials for a mass evacuation of Afghans and urged them not to rely on a backlogged special visa program that could keep Afghans waiting for months or years.",
      "There was no time for visas, they said, and Afghans had to be removed quickly to stay alive. The response was cordial but noncommittal, according to one participant, who recalled a sinking feeling afterward that the White House had no plan.",
      "Representative Seth Moulton, a Massachusetts Democrat, veteran and ally of Mr. Biden, echoed those concerns in his own discussions with the administration. Mr. Moulton said he told anyone who would listen at the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon that \u201cthey need to stop processing visas in Afghanistan and just get people to safety.\u201d",
      "But doing what Mr. Moulton and the refugee groups wanted would have meant launching a dangerous new military mission that would probably require a surge of troops just at the moment that Mr. Biden had announced the opposite. It also ran counter to what the Afghan government wanted, because a high-profile evacuation would amount to a vote of no confidence in the government and its forces.",
      "Instead, the State Department sped up its efforts to process visas and clear the backlog. Officials overhauled the lengthy screening and vetting process and reduced processing time \u2014 but only to under a year. Eventually, they issued more than 5,600 special visas from April to July, the largest number in the program\u2019s history but still a small fraction of the demand.",
      "The Taliban continued their advance as the embassy in Kabul urged Americans to leave. On April 27, the embassy had ordered nearly 3,000 members of its staff to depart, and on May 15, officials there sent the latest in a series of warnings to Americans in the country: \u201cU.S. Embassy strongly suggests that U.S. citizens make plans to leave Afghanistan as soon as possible.\u201d",
      "On June 25, Mr. Ghani met with Mr. Biden at the White House for what would become for the foreseeable future the last meeting between an American president and the Afghan leaders they had coaxed, cajoled and argued with over 20 years.",
      "When the cameras were on at the beginning of the meeting, Mr. Ghani and Mr. Biden expressed mutual admiration even though Mr. Ghani was fuming about the decision to pull out American troops. As soon as reporters were shooed out of the room, the tension was clear.",
      "Mr. Ghani, a former World Bank official whom Mr. Biden regarded as stubborn and arrogant, had three requests, according to an official familiar with the conversation. He wanted the United States to be \u201cconservative\u201d in granting exit visas to the interpreters and others, and \u201clow key\u201d about their leaving the country so it would not look as if America lacked faith in his government.",
      "He also wanted to speed up security assistance and secure an agreement for the U.S. military to continue to conduct airstrikes and provide overwatch from its planes and helicopters for his troops fighting the Taliban. American officials feared that the more they were drawn into direct combat with the militant group, the more its fighters would treat American diplomats as targets.",
      "Mr. Biden agreed to provide the air support and to not make a public show of the Afghan evacuations.",
      "Mr. Biden had his own request for Mr. Ghani. The Afghan forces were stretched too thin, Mr. Biden told him, and should not try to fight everywhere. He repeated American advice that Mr. Ghani consolidate Afghan forces around key locations, but Mr. Ghani never took it.",
      "A week later, on July 2, Mr. Biden, in an ebullient mood, gathered a small group of reporters to celebrate new jobs numbers that he said showed that his economic recovery plan was working. But all the questions he received were about news from Afghanistan that the United States had abandoned Bagram Air Base, with little to no notice to the Afghans.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a rational drawdown with our allies,\u201d he insisted, \u201cso there\u2019s nothing unusual about it.\u201d",
      "But as the questions persisted, on Afghanistan rather than the economy, he grew visibly annoyed. He recalled Mr. Ghani\u2019s visit and said, \u201cI think they have the capacity to be able to sustain the government,\u201d though he added that there would have to be negotiations with the Taliban.",
      "Then, for the first time, he was pressed on what the administration would do to save Kabul if it came under direct attack. \u201cI want to talk about happy things, man,\u201d he said. He insisted there was a plan.",
      "\u201cWe have worked out an over-the-horizon capacity,\u201d he said, meaning the administration had contingency plans should things go badly. \u201cBut the Afghans are going to have to be able to do it themselves with the Air Force they have, which we\u2019re helping them maintain,\u201d he said. But by then, most of the U.S. contractors who helped keep the Afghan planes flying had been withdrawn from Bagram along with the troops. Military and intelligence officials acknowledge they were worried that the Afghans would not be able to stay in the air.",
      "By July 8, nearly all American forces were out of Afghanistan as the Taliban continued their surge across the country. In a speech that day from the White House defending his decision to leave, Mr. Biden was in a bind trying to express skepticism about the abilities of the Afghan forces while being careful not to undermine their government. Afterward, he angrily responded to a reporter\u2019s comparison to Vietnam by insisting that \u201cthere\u2019s going to be no circumstance where you see people being lifted off the roof of an embassy of the United States from Afghanistan. It is not at all comparable.\u201d",
      "But five days later, nearly two dozen American diplomats, all in the Kabul embassy, sent a memo directly to Mr. Blinken through the State Department\u2019s \u201cdissent\u201d channel. The cable, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, urged that evacuation flights for Afghans begin in two weeks and that the administration move faster to register them for visas.",
      "The next day, in a move already underway, the White House named a stepped-up effort \u201cOperation Allies Refuge.\u201d",
      "By late July, Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., the head of U.S. Central Command who oversees all military operations in the region, received permission from Mr. Austin to extend the deployment of the amphibious assault ship Iwo Jima in the Gulf of Oman, so that the Marines on board could be close enough to get to Afghanistan to evacuate Americans. A week later, Mr. Austin was concerned enough to order the expeditionary unit on the ship \u2014 some 2,000 Marines \u2014 to disembark and wait in Kuwait so that they could reach Afghanistan quickly.",
      "By Aug. 3, top national security officials met in Washington and heard an updated intelligence assessment: District capitals across Afghanistan were falling rapidly to the Taliban and the Afghan government could collapse in \u201cdays or weeks.\u201d It was not the most likely outcome, but it was an increasingly plausible one.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re assisting the government so that the Talibs do not think this is going to be a cakewalk, that they can conquer and take over the country,\u201d the chief American envoy to Afghan peace talks, Zalmay Khalilzad, told the Aspen Security Forum on Aug. 3. Days later, however, that is exactly what happened.",
      "By Aug. 6, the maps in the Pentagon showed a spreading stain of areas under Taliban control. In some places, the Afghans had put up a fight, but in many others, there was just surrender.",
      "That same day in Washington, the Pentagon reviewed worst-case scenarios. If security further deteriorated, planning \u2014 begun days after Mr. Biden\u2019s withdrawal announcement in April \u2014 led by Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, the president\u2019s homeland security adviser, called for flying most of the embassy personnel out of the compound, and many out of the country, while a small core group of diplomats operated from a backup site at the airport.",
      "On its face, the Kabul airport made sense as an evacuation point. Close to the center of the city, it could be as little as a 12-minute drive and a three-minute helicopter flight from the embassy \u2014 logistics that had helped reassure planners after the closure of Bagram, which was more than 50 miles and a far longer drive from Kabul.",
      "By Wednesday, Aug. 11, the Taliban advances were so alarming that Mr. Biden asked his top national security advisers in the White House Situation Room if it was time to send the Marines to Kabul and to evacuate the embassy. He asked for an updated assessment of the situation and authorized the use of military planes for evacuating Afghan allies.",
      "Overnight in Washington, Kandahar and Ghazni were falling. National security officials were awakened as early as 4 a.m. on Aug. 12 and told to gather for an urgent meeting a few hours later to provide options to the president. Once assembled, Avril D. Haines, the director of national intelligence, told the group that the intelligence agencies could no longer assure that they could provide sufficient warning if the capital was about to be under siege.",
      "Everyone looked at one another, one participant said, and came to the same conclusion: It was time to get out. An hour later, Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden\u2019s national security adviser, walked into the Oval Office to deliver the group\u2019s unanimous consensus to start an evacuation and deploy 3,000 Marines and Army soldiers to the airport.",
      "By Saturday, Aug. 14, Mr. Biden was at Camp David for what he hoped would be the start of a 10-day vacation. Instead, he spent much of the day on dire video conference calls with his top aides.",
      "On one of the calls, Mr. Austin urged all remaining personnel at the Kabul embassy be moved immediately to the airport. It was a stunning turnaround from what Ned Price, the State Department spokesman, had said two days earlier: \u201cThe embassy remains open, and we plan to continue our diplomatic work in Afghanistan.\u201d Ross Wilson, the acting U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan who was on the call, said the staff still needed 72 hours to leave.",
      "\u201cYou have to move now,\u201d Mr. Austin replied.",
      "Mr. Blinken spoke by phone to Mr. Ghani the same day. The Afghan president was defiant, according to one official familiar with the conversation, and insisted that he would defend Afghanistan until the end. He did not tell Mr. Blinken that he was already planning to flee his country, which American officials first learned by reading news reports.",
      "Later that day, the U.S. embassy in Afghanistan sent a message saying it would pay for American citizens to get out of the country, but warned that although there were reports that international commercial flights were still operating from Kabul, \u201cseats may not be available.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Ghani was gone. His departure \u2014 he would eventually turn up days later in the United Arab Emirates \u2014 and scenes of the Taliban celebrating at his presidential palace documented the collapse of the government. By the end of the day, the Taliban addressed the news media, declaring their intention to restore the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.",
      "The evacuation of the Kabul embassy staff was by that point underway as diplomats rushed to board military helicopters for the short trip to the airport bunker.",
      "Others stayed behind long enough to burn sensitive documents. Another official said embassy helicopters were blown up or otherwise destroyed, which sent a cloud of smoke over the compound.",
      "Many Americans and Afghans could not reach the airport as Taliban fighters set up checkpoints on roads throughout the city and beat some people, leaving top F.B.I. officials concerned about the possibility that the Taliban or criminal gangs might kidnap Americans, a nightmare outcome with the U.S. military no longer in the country.",
      "As Mr. Biden made plans Sunday evening to address Americans the next day about the situation, the American flag was lowered over the abandoned embassy. The Green Zone, once the heart of the American effort to remake the country, was again Taliban territory."

    "title": "New Israeli Leader Backs Hard Line on Iran but Softer Tone With U.S.",
    "content": [
      "JERUSALEM \u2014 Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, speaking days before his first meeting with President Biden as Israel\u2019s new leader, said he would oppose American-led attempts to reinstate a lapsed nuclear agreement with Iran and continue Israel\u2019s covert attacks on Iran\u2019s nuclear program.",
      "In an interview with The New York Times, his first with an international news organization since succeeding Benjamin Netanyahu in June, he also said he would expand West Bank settlements that Mr. Biden opposes, declined to back American plans to reopen a consulate for Palestinians in Jerusalem and ruled out reaching a peace agreement with the Palestinians under his watch.",
      "While these policies differed little in substance from those of his predecessor, Mr. Bennett said he would use the meeting with Mr. Biden to try to reset the tone of Israel\u2019s relationship with the United States, which was rocky between Mr. Netanyahu and Democratic administrations. He said he would seek common ground with the Biden administration on Iran, and promised to arrive at the White House with a new and constructive approach to containing Iran\u2019s nuclear program.",
      "\u201cI call it the good-will government,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a new dimension here \u2014 coming up with new ways to address problems, being very realistic, very pragmatic, and being reasonable with friends.\u201d",
      "Mr. Bennett said he would present a new strategic vision on Iran, which he said would include strengthening ties with Arab countries opposed to Iran\u2019s regional influence and nuclear ambitions, taking diplomatic and economic action against Iran, and continuing Israel\u2019s clandestine attacks on Iran, including what he called \u201cthe gray-area stuff.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat we need to do, and what we are doing, is forming a regional coalition of reasonable Arab countries, together with us, that will fend off and block this expansion and this desire for domination\u201d by Iran, Mr. Bennett said.",
      "\u201cIsrael is here,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are the precise anchor of stability, of willingness to do the job to keep this area safer.\u201d",
      "Against the backdrop of America\u2019s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and the installation of a new, hard-line president in Iran, Mr. Bennett\u2019s charm offensive could provide Mr. Biden with a minor foreign policy laurel \u2014 the revitalization of a relationship with a key American ally after recent setbacks on the world stage.",
      "But it could also provide kindling for friction.",
      "Mr. Bennett did not reveal the details of his new vision for Iran, but the policies he cited could just as easily have been articulated by Mr. Netanyahu, if perhaps more combatively. Mr. Netanyahu vehemently opposed the 2015 nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which he said did not do enough to restrict Iran\u2019s long-term nuclear ambitions and failed to address Iran\u2019s other destabilizing activities in the region, including its support for proxy militias.",
      "Mr. Netanyahu successfully encouraged President Trump to abandon the deal. He also accelerated a long-running shadow war with Iran and sealed diplomatic agreements with four Arab countries that once ostracized Israel \u2014 deals that he hoped would help his fight against Iran.",
      "But Mr. Bennett\u2019s constructive tone differs from that of Mr. Netanyahu, who had a strong relationship with the Trump administration but a fraught one with the Democratic administrations that book-ended Mr. Trump\u2019s tenure. In 2015, Mr. Netanyahu antagonized President Obama with a combative speech before Congress that criticized the impending nuclear deal, and in 2010 he embarrassed Mr. Biden, then Mr. Obama\u2019s vice president, when his government announced new settlement construction in East Jerusalem shortly after Mr. Biden arrived in Israel on an official visit.",
      "It took Mr. Biden nearly a month after his inauguration to call Mr. Netanyahu, which some Israeli analysts took as a snub. In contrast, Mr. Biden called Mr. Bennett just two hours after the new Israeli leader had been sworn into office.",
      "Mr. Bennett\u2019s more conciliatory approach is part of a wider effort by the new premier to show that Israel has moved on from Mr. Netanyahu, who developed an increasingly fractious relationship with congressional Democrats and polarized American Jews, an approach that critics said risked turning seven decades of solid American support for Israel into a partisan issue.",
      "By contrast, Mr. Bennett heads a diverse governing coalition that he says aims to soothe Israel\u2019s social and political divisions, tackle domestic policy conundrums that went unaddressed during Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s final years in power and heal relations with the Biden administration and estranged Arab countries, like Jordan.",
      "\u201cWe could be this lighthouse in a storm, if you will,\u201d Mr. Bennett said.",
      "A former high-tech entrepreneur who spent parts of his childhood in the United States and Canada and speaks fluent English, Mr. Bennett represents a new generation in Israeli politics. The first Israeli prime minister to wear a kippa, a Jewish skullcap, he has long moved easily between the religious and secular worlds and says the skills required for building successful start-ups equally apply when it comes to rebooting the country.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s all about flexibility,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about responding rapidly to new information and new developments.\u201d",
      "But on major issues, the new Israel is a lot like the old one.",
      "A former settler leader who opposes the creation of a Palestinian state, Mr. Bennett said there would be no resolution of the conflict with the Palestinians for the foreseeable future. But he also said that he would not advance his earlier plan, later endorsed then dropped by Mr. Netanyahu, to annex large parts of the occupied West Bank.",
      "Peace talks will not happen partly because the Palestinian leadership is fractured and rudderless, he said. But also because Mr. Bennett is resolutely opposed to Palestinian sovereignty.",
      "And on a practical level, any attempt to address the issue would break up his diverse coalition, which includes parties that support Palestinian statehood and others opposed.",
      "\u201cThis government is a government that will make dramatic breakthroughs in the economy,\u201d Mr. Bennett said. \u201cIts claim to fame will not be solving the 130-year-old conflict here in Israel.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cThis government will neither annex nor form a Palestinian state, everyone gets that. I\u2019m prime minister of all Israelis, and what I\u2019m doing now is finding the middle ground \u2014 how we can focus on what we agree upon.\u201d",
      "In Mr. Bennett\u2019s view, most problems, including the Palestinian conflict, can be addressed through \u201ceconomy, economy, economy.\u201d He intends to focus on bottom-up, on-the-ground steps that he said were more important than recycled political efforts doomed to failure.",
      "But on the construction of West Bank settlements and the blockade of Gaza, Mr. Bennett is picking up where Mr. Netanyahu left off.",
      "The blockade will remain as long as Hamas, the militant group that rules the territory, continues to arm itself and fire rockets at Israel, he said. And he said he would be prepared to engage in another war with Hamas even if it lost him the support of the four Arab lawmakers whose backing keeps him in power.",
      "\u201cI will do what\u2019s necessary to secure my people,\u201d Mr. Bennett said. \u201cI will not and never involve political considerations in defense- and security-related decisions.\u201d",
      "Mr. Bennett authorized several air raids on militant bases in Gaza on recent nights, after arsonists in Gaza sent incendiary balloons into southern Israel and a militant shot and critically wounded an Israeli soldier who had been firing on Palestinian rioters. These exchanges tested the fragile cease-fire that ended an 11-day war in May, but which has yet to be formalized.",
      "Mr. Bennett said his government would extend a longstanding Israeli policy of expanding existing settlements in the West Bank, which much of the world considers illegal under international law and an impediment to the creation of a future Palestinian state in the occupied territories.",
      "\u201cIsrael will continue the standard policy of natural growth,\u201d Mr. Bennett said.",
      "He also declined to comment directly on whether he would block the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to reestablish a consulate for the Palestinians in Jerusalem. Mr. Trump closed the consulate, folding its duties into the United States Embassy, which he moved to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv.",
      "But Mr. Biden hopes to reopen the consulate to help mend a relationship with the Palestinians that collapsed under Mr. Trump. Palestinians hope that East Jerusalem, which Israel captured from Jordan in 1967, will one day form the capital of a Palestinian state. Mr. Bennett chafes at any gesture that might signal support for a future division of the city.",
      "\u201cJerusalem is the capital of Israel,\u201d Mr. Bennett said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the capital of other nations.\u201d",
      "And the prime minister batted away rights issues that recent polls suggest are of increasing concern to liberal Jews in the United States. He rejected claims that Israel operates a policy of apartheid in the West Bank, and condemned a recent decision by the ice-cream maker, Ben & Jerry\u2019s, to stop selling ice cream in the occupied territories.",
      "Over the course of an hourlong interview, Mr. Bennett was at his most engaged and passionate when talking about more technocratic topics, like his recent decision to provide Israelis with a third dose of a coronavirus vaccine.",
      "Israel is battling a fourth wave of coronavirus infections despite having a world-leading vaccination program. Mr. Bennett is micromanaging the crisis, starting each day by reviewing new global and Israeli data and research.",
      "He pioneered the provision of booster shots before the practice was approved even by American health authorities, again turning Israel into a real-world test case for vaccine efficacy.",
      "\u201cI talk to, I\u2019d say, three or four leaders around the world about stuff every week,\u201d Mr. Bennett said. \u201cThe moment Covid comes up, a 20-minute call turns into an hour-and-a-half call. Because Covid is the biggest issue on every leader\u2019s plate.\u201d",
      "Surrounded by biographies of great leaders \u2014 including Caesar, Abraham Lincoln and Israel\u2019s founding prime minister, David Ben-Gurion \u2014 Mr. Bennett portrayed himself as having prepared all his life for this moment of leadership.",
      "But amid all the talk of a post-Netanyahu era, it was not long before the Israeli reality hit home. Mid-interview, an aide burst into Mr. Bennett\u2019s office, asking us to leave. A domestic public relations crisis needed the prime minister\u2019s urgent attention.",
      "Mr. Bennett had spoken the previous night to the family of the soldier wounded in the recent Gaza clashes, and at one point bungled the soldier\u2019s name. Another politician had also called the family and gotten all the details right, the soldier\u2019s mother told the Israeli news media that morning.",
      "The politician\u2019s name was Benjamin Netanyahu."

    "content": [
      "Tens of thousands of Afghan nationals risked their lives to help the United States military in Afghanistan, many of them working as interpreters in combat. Now, after the Taliban\u2019s takeover, they are desperate to leave \u2014 but passage to the United States may prove elusive.",
      "More than 300,000 Afghan civilians have been affiliated with the American mission over its two-decade presence in the country, according to the International Rescue Committee, but a minority qualify for refugee protection in the United States.",
      "About 2,000 such people whose cases already had been approved have arrived in the United States on evacuation flights from Kabul, the capital, that began in July.  President Biden said on Monday while addressing the nation that there were plans to airlift more Afghan families in \u201ccoming days,\u201d though he provided no details.",
      "Refugee advocates said they feared that thousands of vulnerable people were likely to be left behind, at their peril, as militants tightened their grip on Afghanistan\u2019s territory.",
      "Since 2002, the United States has employed Afghans to assist U.S. troops, diplomats and aid workers. Many were threatened, kidnapped and attacked, and an unknown number killed, as a result of their association with the United States. In response, Congress created the special immigrant visa programs to give such workers a path to legal residency in the United States.",
      "But the programs, which enjoy broad bipartisan support, have been marred by processing delays.",
      "Applicants must show they have been employed for at least two years by the U.S. government or an associated entity. Among other paperwork, they must prove they performed valuable service by providing a recommendation from an American supervisor. They must also show that they have experienced, or are experiencing, a serious threat as a consequence of their work for the United States.",
      "More than 15,000 Afghan nationals, plus family members, have already been resettled in the United States with special immigrant visas, out of a total of 34,500 authorized visas.",
      "At least 18,000 people have applications pending, and that number is expected to increase considerably given the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan.",
      "Critics say that the U.S. government, going back several administrations, has delayed special immigrant visa approvals by demanding an extraordinary amount of documentation as part of an unwieldy 14-step process.",
      "Applicants have faced average wait times of three years, though Congress had specified that it should take no more than nine months. Many have been waiting as long as a decade for the outcome of their cases.",
      "Special immigrant visa recipients are eligible for the same resettlement benefits as refugees. They arrive with green cards, and can apply for U.S. citizenship after five years. But they are not classified as refugees, nor do they count against the number of refugees that the United States commits to admitting each year.",
      "The U.S. government since July has evacuated about 2,000 interpreters and their family members whose cases had already been approved. They were brought from Kabul to the Fort Lee military base south of Richmond, Va., and many have since been sent to cities across the country. But staff members from refugee resettlement agencies were notified after the latest flight landed on Sunday that plans to evacuate more Afghans had been suspended.",
      "Garry Reid, a civilian Pentagon official charged with handling the evacuations, said on Monday that 700 Afghan allies had been evacuated in the previous 48 hours. He said the United States would scale up by receiving more departing Afghans at U.S. military bases, but he did not offer a specific timeline.",
      "The Biden administration also had been negotiating with several countries in the Middle East and Central Asia to temporarily host some people until they can be resettled in the United States. But it was not clear whether it would even be possible to evacuate more Afghan allies, at least for now, given the volatility on the ground."

      "The influx of patients is straining hospitals and pushing health care workers to the brink as deaths have risen to an average of more than 1,000 a day for the first time since March. The seven-day average of Covid hospitalizations peaked in mid-January with nearly 140,000 people hospitalized.",
      "Hospitalizations nationwide have increased by nearly 500 percent in the past two months, particularly across Southern states, where I.C.U. beds are filling up, a crisis fueled by some of the country\u2019s lowest vaccination rates and widespread political opposition to public health measures like mask requirements.",
      "In Florida, 16,457 people are hospitalized, the most of any state, followed by Texas, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "With the surge pummeling the nation and overwhelming hospitals, a shortage of bedside nurses has complicated efforts to treat hospitalized coronavirus patients, leading to longer emergency room waiting times and rushed or inadequate care.",
      "This month, one in five American I.C.U.s had reached or exceeded 95 percent of beds full. Alabama was one of the first states to run out, and the crisis is concentrated in the South, with small pockets of high occupancy elsewhere in the country.

      "As in previous surges, hospitals have been forced to expand capacity by creating makeshift I.C.U.s in areas typically reserved for other types of care, and even in hallways or spare rooms.

      "The sweeping international effort to evacuate thousands of vulnerable Afghans and foreign nationals from Kabul\u2019s airport neared completion on Saturday as the United States continued to withdraw its remaining troops from Taliban-controlled Afghanistan after carrying out a retaliatory airstrike in response to a devastating terrorist attack.",
      "Britain planned to end the evacuation of its citizens on Saturday and to begin bringing its remaining troops home, Gen. Nick Carter, the chief of the defense staff, told the BBC\u2019s Radio 4. More American troops have also begun getting on planes and leaving. A military official said on Saturday that there were around 4,000 U.S. troops in Kabul, down from 5,800 a few days ago.",
      "The official\u2019s comment came just as President Biden warned that \u201can attack is highly likely in the next 24 to 36 hours.\u201d Early Sunday morning in Kabul, the United States Embassy warned of a \u201cspecific, credible threat\u201d to the airport area and urged all American citizens there to leave immediately.",
      "The troop departures signaled a tumultuous end to a 20-year war that has left the country awash in grief and desperation, with many Afghans fearing for their lives under Taliban rule and struggling with cash shortages and rising food prices.",
      "\u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to bring everybody out and that has been heartbreaking,\u201d General Carter told the BBC. \u201cThere have been some very challenging judgments that have had to be made on the ground.\u201d",
      "France, too, has ended its evacuations, French officials said on Friday.",
      "With just three days remaining before Mr. Biden\u2019s Aug. 31 deadline to withdraw U.S. troops, the mission has been shifting its focus, from vetting and airlifting Afghan civilians to bringing home American military personnel.",
      "About 6,800 people were evacuated from the Kabul airport on Friday, down significantly from early Thursday, when White House officials said that 13,400 people had been evacuated from the airport in the previous 24 hours.",
      "About 117,000 people, most of them Afghans, have been evacuated since the Taliban seized Kabul on Aug. 15, Pentagon officials said. On Saturday, about 1,400 people were still at the airport, and had been screened and booked for flights, Pentagon officials said.",
      "About 350 Americans have told the State Department that they were still seeking to leave the country, the department said on Saturday, adding that it believes some may have already left Afghanistan.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of Afghans are still thought to be trying to flee the country, yet Mr. Biden and other global leaders have acknowledged that many will not get out before the deadline.",
      "Outside Kabul\u2019s airport on Saturday, roads remained closed and the large crowds that had strained to push inside had largely dissipated in the aftermath of Thursday\u2019s suicide bombing, which killed 13 American service members and as many as 170 civilians.",
      "At the Abbey Gate, near where the bombing occurred, only two families and two young men still waited.",
      "The airport\u2019s South Gate remained open, and there was a growing backlog of buses carrying some 500 to 1,000 people, as U.S. military personnel screened for suicide vests and other explosives. The Taliban, which was manning checkpoints around the airport, also turned away dozens of buses. Few people, if any, were getting through the airport gates.",
      "Among those still hoping to leave were two brothers who said they had traveled 26 hours from Herat, a city in Western Afghanistan, and had managed to sneak past guards outside the airport\u2019s perimeter to reach the Abbey Gate. One of them said he had been selected by a U.S. visa lottery.",
      "The brothers knew of the deadly explosion at the gate two nights ago, \u201cbut what can we do,\u201d one of them said on Saturday. \u201cThis is our only way out.\u201d",
      "Officials from Turkey, Qatar and the Group of 7 nations are to meet on Monday on a range of issues about Afghanistan, including the future of the Kabul airport, according to two officials familiar with the discussions.",
      "After the American military leaves on Tuesday, the path for Afghan evacuees will grow only more difficult as the Taliban takes control of the airport.",
      "Ned Price, a State Department spokesman, said on Friday that officials were in talks with allies, and the Taliban, to allow nonmilitary flights to resume as quickly as possible after the U.S. military\u2019s departure.",
      "He would not comment on reports that Turkey and Qatar were planning to run the airport with the Taliban, although he said that Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken had spoken with Turkey\u2019s foreign minister, Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu, to discuss \u201cour cooperation in Afghanistan and our continuing efforts to ensure the safe and orderly evacuation of our citizens, allies and partners.\u201d",
      "Thursday\u2019s attack near the airport was one of the deadliest in the nearly two decades since the U.S.-led invasion.",
      "\u201cThe situation on the ground continues to be extremely dangerous, and the threat of terrorist attacks on the airport remains high,\u201d Mr. Biden said in a statement on Saturday. \u201cOur commanders informed me that an attack is highly likely in the next 24-36 hours.\u201d",
      "The Pentagon on Saturday gave its fullest account yet of Friday\u2019s strike in response to the bombing outside the airport. It said that the military had used a drone to kill two \u201chigh-profile\u201d targets for the Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan, also known as ISIS-K or the Islamic State Khorasan, a group that is a rival of the Taliban and that claimed responsibility for Thursday\u2019s attack. Military officials said one other target was injured.",
      "Defense Department officials said one drone target was an ISIS-K \u201cplanner,\u201d and the other was a \u201cfacilitator.\u201d",
      "The strike was carried out by a single MQ-9 Reaper drone flying from a base in the United Arab Emirates, according to a senior U.S. military official. The targets were struck in Jalalabad, the capital of Nangarhar Province, roughly 90 miles east of Kabul.",
      "The \u201cplanner\u201d who was killed was believed to be involved in future plots against targets in Kabul, including the airport, but there was no evidence so far that he was involved in the suicide bombing near the airport on Thursday, the official said.",
      "\u201cI said we would go after the group responsible for the attack on our troops and innocent civilians in Kabul, and we have,\u201d Mr. Biden said in his statement. \u201cThis strike was not the last. We will continue to hunt down any person involved in that heinous attack and make them pay.\u201d",
      "Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, condemned the drone strike, telling Reuters it was a \u201cclear attack on Afghan territory.\u201d",
      "For the first time, Pentagon officials publicly acknowledged the possibility that some people killed outside the airport on Thursday might have been shot by American service members after the suicide bombing.",
      "Investigators are looking into whether the gunfire came from Americans at the gate, or from the Islamic State.",
      "The suicide bombing and the American response came as Afghanistan\u2019s economy, which was sustained for years by an influx of international aid, has been in free fall.",
      "Many Afghans are struggling to support their families, and have gathered outside banks and A.T.M.s in the hope of withdrawing money, only to return home cashless and despairing.",
      "On Saturday, hundreds protested outside one bank branch in Kabul and scores more marched through central Kabul to demand the reopening of banks that had closed after the Taliban takeover.",
      "\u201cIslamic government, give us our rights!\u201d they chanted. One of the country\u2019s largest banks, Azizi Bank, issued a statement to customers saying that it was waiting for Afghanistan\u2019s central bank to resume operations before reopening.",
      "A representative of the central bank said that it would reopen on Sunday, but that to prevent bank runs, it might not begin distributing money until a new government was established.",
      "The Taliban have indicated that Hajji Mohammad Idris, a member of the movement, will serve as acting head of the central bank. News reports have indicated that Mr. Idris has no formal financial training.",
      "Despite ending its presence in Afghanistan, the United States still controls billions of dollars belonging to the Afghan central bank, money that Washington is making sure remains out of the reach of the Taliban.",
      "Concern is also growing about the plight of farmers and herders, who form the backbone of Afghanistan\u2019s rural economy. The country continues to be hit hard by a worsening drought that threatens the livelihoods of more than 7 million people who rely on agriculture or livestock, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization warned on Saturday.",
      "\u201cFarmers and livestock owners must not be forgotten in today\u2019s humanitarian crisis,\u201d said Qu Dongyu, the organization\u2019s director-general. \u201cUrgent agricultural support now is key to counter the impact of the drought and a worsening situation in Afghanistan\u2019s vast rural areas in the weeks and months ahead.\u201d"

    "title": "Biden Falls Short on Pledge for U.S. to Be the World\u2019s Vaccine \u2018Arsenal,\u2019 Experts Say",
    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Biden, who has pledged to fight the coronavirus pandemic by making the United States the \u201carsenal of vaccines\u201d for the world, is under increasing criticism from public health experts, global health advocates and even Democrats in Congress who say he is nowhere near fulfilling his promise.",
      "Mr. Biden has either donated or pledged about 600 million vaccine doses to other countries \u2014 a small fraction of the 11 billion that experts say are needed to slow the spread of the virus worldwide. His administration has also taken steps to expand Covid-19 vaccine manufacturing in the United States and India, and is supporting production in South Africa and Senegal to expand access to locally produced vaccines in Africa.",
      "But with the administration now recommending booster doses for vaccinated Americans starting next month, outraged public health experts and many Democrats on Capitol Hill are calling on the president to move more aggressively to scale up global manufacturing. In an analysis to be published on Thursday, the AIDS advocacy group PrEP4All found that the administration had spent less than 1 percent of the money that Congress appropriated for ramping up Covid-19 countermeasures on expanding vaccine manufacturing.",
      "Congress put a total of $16.05 billion in the American Rescue Plan this year, in two separate tranches, that could be used to procure and manufacture treatments, vaccines and tools for ending the pandemic. But PrEP4All found that all told, the administration had spent $145 million \u2014 just $12 million of it from the American Rescue Plan \u2014 to expand vaccine manufacturing. The bulk of that went to retrofitting production lines at Merck, the pharmaceutical giant, which is teaming up with Johnson & Johnson to produce one billion vaccine doses starting in early 2022.",
      "White House officials say all the money has been allocated as intended, including $10 billion for \u201cvaccine raw materials, vaccine and other manufacturing capacity, and industrial base expansion.\u201d But they did not respond to repeated questions about whether or how the money has actually been spent. Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington and the chairwoman of the Senate health committee, has also asked for a more detailed accounting, her office said.",
      "On Capitol Hill, 116 Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have called for putting $34 billion to increase vaccine manufacturing capacity in the upcoming budget reconciliation act. This month, they wrote to the president asking him to endorse the idea, but have not gotten a response, said Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, Democrat of Illinois, who is leading the effort in the House.",
      "\u201cThis lack of attention to executing a robust vaccination strategy abroad is arguably one of their biggest missteps with regard to Covid,\u201d said Mr. Krishnamoorthi, who said he lost three members of his extended family in India to Covid-19.",
      "James Krellenstein, a founder of PrEP4All and the author of its report, was more pointed. \u201cIf they don\u2019t change course pretty soon,\u201d he said, \u201cthe Biden administration is going to be remembered in terms that the Reagan administration is remembered today in not dealing with the AIDS crisis.\u201d",
      "Addressing the world\u2019s coronavirus vaccine needs is a complicated endeavor, with many layers of challenges. Vaccine makers around the world, including those in Russia, China and India, have predicted a total of 12 billion doses by the end of 2021, according to Duke University\u2019s Global Health Innovation Center, which tracks vaccine manufacturing and publishes the Launch & Scale Speedometer website. Eight months into the year, an estimated five billion have been delivered.",
      "Some manufacturers are falling behind. Novavax has had production problems. Johnson & Johnson, which initially planned for one billion doses this year, has made slightly more than 103 million, Mr. Krellenstein said, citing data from the scientific intelligence firm Airfinity. That is in part because its contract manufacturer, Emergent BioSolutions, ruined up to 15 million doses, prompting the Food and Drug Administration to shutter its Baltimore plant for three months.",
      "If 12 billion doses were indeed produced and equitably distributed by year\u2019s end, the world\u2019s needs could be met. But, the Duke institute wrote, \u201cthose are both big ifs.\u201d",
      "Several other countries as well as the United States are already recommending booster shots, which will cut into the supply. And the virus changes shape so rapidly \u2014 the highly infectious Delta variant is now dominant around the globe \u2014 that the vaccines developed last year may soon be outdated, said Dr. Richard Hatchett, the chief executive of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, which helps lead the international vaccine effort known as Covax.",
      "In the short term, poor nations need doses, and Mr. Biden is correct when he says the United States has donated more than any other country. The United States has already donated 115 million surplus doses from the nation\u2019s own supply, and has purchased 500 million doses from Pfizer and BioNTech to be distributed through Covax. With the United States planning for booster shots, one official said, there is no surplus right now.",
      "\u201cTheir financial contributions are huge \u2014 no other country has pledged as much as the U.S.,\u201d Dr. Hatchett said. But, he added, \u201cit\u2019s not to say that they can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t do more.\u201d",
      "Dr. Hatchett said he would like to see a more nuanced discussion of the logistics of not only making vaccines for poor and middle-income nations, but also administering them. The New York Times recently reported that Covax was having trouble getting those shots into people\u2019s arms. Unused doses are sitting idle on airport tarmacs in poor nations that lack the money and capacity to buy fuel to transport doses to clinics, to train people to give the shots \u2014 and to persuade people to take them.",
      "Mr. Biden took his first steps to address the vaccine shortage in March, when the White House announced the Merck deal as well as a partnership with Japan, India and Australia aimed at expanding manufacturing capacity. That included a pledge to help Biological E, an Indian manufacturer, produce one billion doses by the end of 2022.",
      "A White House official said the United States International Development Finance Corporation, which is making the investment, \u201cexpects to begin disbursing funds within the next several weeks.\u201d The official did not offer specifics, or an amount.",
      "Mr. Biden promised in June that the United States would begin an \u201centirely new effort\u201d to increase vaccine supply and vastly expand manufacturing capacity, most of it in the United States. He also put Jeffrey D. Zients, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, in charge of developing a global strategy. Mr. Zients pledged to work with U.S. manufacturers to \u201cvastly increase supply for the rest of the world in a way that also creates jobs here at home.\u201d",
      "But since then, the Delta variant has shifted the focus to the new domestic crisis. Dr. Krishna Udayakumar, the director of the center at Duke, faulted Mr. Biden for pursuing an approach that \u201ccontinues to be piecemeal\u201d \u2014 an assessment echoed by J. Stephen Morrison, a global health expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t have a strategy, nor do they have a structure to execute it,\u201d Mr. Morrison said.",
      "White House officials say that it is not possible for them to scale up production quickly, in part because of a scarcity of raw materials, and that doing so would take three to five years \u2014 an assertion that Dr. Tom Frieden, who directed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the Obama-Biden administration, dismissed as \u201cnonsense.\u201d",
      "Dr. Frieden, now the president of Resolve to Save Lives, a health nonprofit, pointed to Lonza, a Swiss biotechnology company, which entered into an agreement with the vaccine maker Moderna in May 2020, retrofitted its facility in Portsmouth, N.H., and was producing vaccine six months later.",
      "\u201cPeople say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s going to take months,\u2019\u201d Dr. Frieden said. \u201cWell, Covid is with us for years. The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago. The second best time is today.\u201d",
      "Dr. Frieden and others also want the Biden administration to lean more heavily on Pfizer and Moderna to transfer their technology to manufacturers around the globe. The Financial Times reported this week that South Korean vaccine makers are poised to expand, but are struggling to secure intellectual property licensing deals with the two companies.",
      "Mr. Biden is likely to make some kind of announcement about addressing the pandemic when the United Nations General Assembly convenes in New York for its annual meeting in September. The administration is considering creating a government-owned manufacturing plant that would be run by a private contractor \u2014 a plan endorsed by PrEP4All. But a person familiar with the proposal said it was only a possibility at this point.",
      "There are challenges with such an approach, particularly if experienced vaccine makers do not participate, as the situation with Emergent BioSolutions demonstrated.",
      "Mr. Krishnamoorthi said the Democrats\u2019 plan was modeled on PEPFAR, the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, an initiative started by President George W. Bush that has invested $85 billion to address the global AIDS epidemic.",
      "Public Citizen, the nonprofit consumer advocacy organization, has a plan calling for the government to invest $25 billion in developing regional manufacturing hubs around the world, which it says would produce enough vaccine for low- and middle-income countries in a year.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s said, \u2018We\u2019ll be an arsenal for the world\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s a little vague,\u201d said Peter Maybarduk, who directs Public Citizen\u2019s Access to Medicines program. \u201cWhat we see instead are dribs and drabs, like the excess of the U.S. supply, maybe if we\u2019re not using it for third shots at home.\u201d"

    "title": "Taliban Takeover Could Extinguish U.S. Influence in Kabul",
    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The fall of Kabul on Sunday left the Biden administration facing the once-unthinkable prospect of whether, and how, to engage with a Taliban-led government in Afghanistan\u2019s capital \u2014 or cede all influence in the country to an extremist group that brutalized Afghans and harbored Osama bin Laden as he planned attacks on America.",
      "The sudden exile of President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, just hours after President Biden and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken each assured him of full American support, gives the Taliban little incentive to negotiate a transitional government for a country in crisis, said two U.S. officials involved in discussions inside the administration.",
      "The officials said Mr. Ghani fled his country without telling his cabinet or leaving plans for a government handover. That has all but ensured the Taliban\u2019s ascent to power \u2014 one that the Biden administration can only hope will be carried out as peacefully as possible.",
      "It also likely extinguishes a long-stalled American effort for peace talks toward establishing a power-sharing system between the Taliban and Afghanistan\u2019s elected leaders, and leaves U.S. officials hoping that a group that has defied nearly all pleas for moderation in recent months will protect some semblance of women\u2019s and political rights and honor a pledge not to harbor Qaeda terrorists.",
      "Mr. Blinken said the United States would support talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban \u201cabout the way forward.\u201d",
      "The chief American negotiator, Zalmay Khalilzad, was in Doha, Qatar, working with the United Nations and other international diplomats \u201cto see if there can be a peaceful resolution going forward, a peaceful settlement, a peaceful transfer of power that would be good for the people of Afghanistan to avoid further bloodshed,\u201d Mr. Blinken said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "One official said Mr. Khalilzad was working to get an agreement from Afghan leaders \u2014 including Abdullah Abdullah, the chairman of Afghan national reconciliation council, which was set up last year, and possibly Hamid Karzai, the former president \u2014 to start talks with Taliban negotiators. Both men are believed to be among the only Afghan officials left who have enough political standing to persuade the Taliban to discuss next steps.",
      "But privately, Biden administration officials said they were facing a bitter reality of having little to no influence over a peace process that now appears to be little more than a negotiated surrender by a defeated Afghan government.",
      "Representative Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, blamed both the Biden and Trump administrations for what she called the \u201cdevastating, catastrophic real-time lesson\u201d of withdrawing U.S. troops from a nation where a tenuous government depended on military assistance. But she had particularly sharp words for former President Donald J. Trump and his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who oversaw a February 2020 agreement with the Taliban to end the war.",
      "\u201cThey walked down this path of legitimizing the Taliban, of perpetuating this fantasy, telling the American people that the Taliban were a partner for peace,\u201d Ms. Cheney said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Trump told us that the Taliban was going to fight terror,\u201d Ms. Cheney said. \u201cSecretary Pompeo told us that the Taliban was going to renounce Al Qaeda. None of that has happened.\u201d",
      "After taking office in January, Mr. Biden decided to stick to the agreement with the Taliban, which Mr. Khalilzad brokered. On Sunday, Mr. Blinken sought to make the case that the deal committed the United States to withdrawing its troops or facing the certain prospect of attacks on Americans in Afghanistan who were already at risk given a dwindling number of security forces who could protect them.",
      "He called the astonishing pace of the Taliban\u2019s nationwide rout \u201ca very fluid situation.\u201d",
      "The last American personnel at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul fled to the capital\u2019s international airport on Sunday, sheltering in what Mr. Blinken described earlier in the day as a small but enduring mission to be located there while leaving behind a sprawling compound, stripped of its American flag, in the heart of Kabul.",
      "Moving diplomatic offices to the airport will allow officials to swiftly depart if under immediate threat, and Mr. Blinken said it would maintain an American presence in Afghanistan as the Biden administration has promised. At the same time, embassy officials urged American citizens who were still in Afghanistan to shelter in place and resubmit paperwork to request help for evacuating instead of showing up at the airport, given reports of gunfire there.",
      "While briefing members of Congress on the fast-moving developments, Mr. Blinken said the State Department was creating a new task force for Afghanistan issues, to be led by Dean Thompson, the acting assistant secretary for South and Central Asian affairs, according to a person familiar with the call.",
      "Despite the United States investing billions of dollars and suffering the deaths of thousands of Americans during a 20-year war in Afghanistan, it now has limited influence over the swiftly unfolding endgame in Kabul. The question now is what leverage, if any, the Biden administration might have over a government controlled in part or wholly by the Taliban.",
      "For months, Biden officials have offered the hopeful rationale that the Taliban might moderate their behavior once in power to win diplomatic recognition and foreign aid. During a visit to Afghanistan in April, Mr. Blinken called it \u201cvery important that the Taliban recognize that it will never be legitimate and it will never be durable if it rejects a political process and tries to take the country by force.\u201d",
      "And during an interview with Al Jazeera last month, Mr. Blinken warned that \u201cif an Afghanistan emerges that does not respect the basic rights of its people, that abuses the rights of women and girls, that does not respect the basic gains of the last 20 years, that Afghanistan will be a pariah in the international community.\u201d",
      "But the Taliban\u2019s summer rampage across the country has left such hopes in shambles. While the group attended peace talks with Afghan government officials in the ostensible pursuit of a power-sharing agreement, its rapid takeover suggests it was never acting in good faith.",
      "The group\u2019s advance across the country has been marked by reports of massacres, targeted executions of government officials, security forces and civil society leaders, and forced \u201cmarriages\u201d of women that human rights groups equate to sexual slavery.",
      "\u201cThe Taliban are an ideological group, not just a group of politicians seeking power \u2014 they cannot go too far from their belief system,\u201d said Husain Haqqani, a former Pakistani ambassador to Washington who is now a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute. \u201cThe notion that the desire for international legitimacy outweighs someone\u2019s core beliefs is a fantasy that has led Americans into unrealistic expectations and erroneous policies before.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Blinken also said the Taliban should not dare to be caught sheltering international terrorists like bin Laden, who planned the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks from Afghanistan.",
      "\u201cThe Taliban have a certain self-interest in this,\u201d Mr. Blinken said on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cThey know what happened the last time they harbored a terrorist group that attacked the United States. It\u2019s not in their self-interest to allow a repeat of that.\u201d",
      "Mr. Haqqani noted, however, that the United States had demanded before the 2001 attacks that the Taliban hand over bin Laden and was rebuffed.",
      "In a particularly ominous development, the Taliban on Sunday claimed to have freed prisoners held at the Bagram Air Base outside Kabul, where \u201chigh value\u201d Qaeda members had been detained, according to Bill Roggio, a longtime Afghanistan analyst at the hawkish Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \u201cThis will reverberate for years to come,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.",
      "As the United States raced to evacuate personnel from its embassy in Kabul, human and refugee rights groups sharply criticized the Biden administration for not moving faster to relocate America\u2019s Afghan allies from a country where they were at risk of lethal Taliban reprisals.",
      "\u201cUnless there is a swift and meaningful effort to evacuate the thousands of allies and their families to the United States or a U.S. territory, we will have broken our promise to leave no one behind,\u201d Jennifer Quigley, senior director for government affairs at Human Rights First, said in a statement.",
      "Earlier this month, the Biden administration announced that Afghans not eligible for the Special Immigrant Visa program created by Congress to protect those who had assisted the American military \u2014 including those who worked for U.S.-based media organizations and nongovernmental organizations \u2014 could apply for high-priority refugee status.",
      "But U.S. officials said those Afghans, who may number in the tens of thousands, must first leave the country under their own auspices merely to begin an application process that can take more than a year.",
      "With the Taliban in control of cities, highways and border crossings, it may now be too late for many of them to leave."

      "The man, Eduard Florea, 41, of Queens, pleaded guilty to posting violent threats against Mr. Warnock, who had just won a runoff election in Georgia for the Senate and was later sworn in on Jan. 20. \u201cWarnock is going to have a hard time casting votes for communist policies when he\u2019s swinging with the fish,\u201d Mr. Florea posted online on Jan. 5, using an expletive before fish.",
      "Mr. Florea also pleaded guilty in Federal District Court in Brooklyn to a weapons offense after federal agents discovered a vast arsenal in his New York City home in January, including more than 1,000 rounds of rifle ammunition that he unlawfully possessed because of a prior felony conviction, prosecutors said in a news release.",
      "Mr. Florea, a software engineer whose arrest in January came amid an intensifying nationwide manhunt for those who broke into the U.S. Capitol, will face up to 15 years in prison when he is sentenced on Nov. 29, federal prosecutors said. Mr. Florea is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.",
      "\u201cWith today\u2019s guilty plea, Florea admits to threatening the life of a successful candidate for the U.S. Senate and to urging others to take up arms to unleash violence at the Capitol,\u201d Jacquelyn M.

      "Mia Eisner-Grynberg, a lawyer for Mr. Florea, declined to comment on Monday.",
      "Mr. Warnock\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The runoff election victory for Mr. Warnock, and that of Jon Ossoff, a fellow Georgia Democrat, effectively cemented control of the U.S. Senate for Democrats, with Vice President Kamala Harris serving as the tiebreaker in the 50-50 chamber.",
      "Mr. Florea posted his violent comments on Parler, a social networking app popular with conservatives, under the name, \u201cLoneWolfWar.\u201d A day before a mob of President Trump\u2019s supporters stormed the Capitol, Mr. Florea, who was not in Washington, posted on Parler that everyone needed to \u201ccome to an agreement\u201d and \u201cgo armed\u201d to the Capitol so they \u201ccould take back Washington,\u201d according to court records.",

      "Later that day, after the storming of the U.S. Capitol had begun, Mr. Florea posted that he intended to go to Washington with a group of armed individuals who would be ready to engage in more violence, federal prosecutors said.",
      "While the Capitol was under siege, federal prosecutors said, Mr. Florea posted: \u201cIt\u2019s time to unleash some violence.\u201d",

      "Few people in Congress have stood as alone as Representative Barbara Lee did on Sept. 14, 2001. Three days earlier, the United States had endured the most devastating attack ever on its soil. Now Congress was called on to authorize the unleashing of American military power against Al Qaeda and its Taliban enablers in Afghanistan who were held responsible for what has eternally come to be called 9/11.",
      "In the House, 420 members voted to give the president that authority. The Senate agreed, 98-0. Only one lawmaker said no: Ms. Lee, a Democrat representing a district centered on Oakland and Berkeley, Calif. Her vote brought angry denunciations and even physical threats.",
      "\u201cPeople were calling me a traitor \u2014 \u2018she\u2019s got to go,\u2019 \u201d she told Retro Report. \u201cBut I knew then that it was going to set the stage for perpetual war.\u201d",
      "That is exactly what it did.",
      "But after 20 years, that perpetual war has finally ended. With the United States-supported Afghan government gone and the Taliban once again in control, Ms. Lee is no longer a lonely skeptical voice in Washington, doubting America\u2019s capacity to reshape a distant and often hostile land. Lessons from the Afghanistan experience form the core of the accompanying video from Retro Report, whose mission is to examine the enduring impact of past events on present policies.",
      "A stiff measure of humility is in order, suggested Richard A. Boucher, who was the assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian Affairs during the administration of President George W. Bush.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t remake a country on the American image,\u201d Mr. Boucher said to Retro Report. \u201cYou can\u2019t win when you\u2019re fighting people for their own villages and their own territory. Those were lessons we thought we learned in Vietnam. And yet, 30 or 40 years later, we end up in Afghanistan repeating the same mistakes.\u201d",
      "Humility was not a hallmark of United States policy in Afghanistan, even though Mr. Bush and his advisers understood that the country was called \u201cthe graveyard of empires\u201d for good reason. Britain had a misadventure there in the 19th century. The Soviet Union had its own in the late 20th century. Somehow, Mr. Bush thought 21st-century America would be different.",
      "Addressing cadets at the Virginia Military Institute in April 2002, a few months after United States-led troops had routed the Taliban, Mr. Bush offered a vision of an Afghanistan reconstituted with Washington\u2019s guiding hand, much as devastated Europe had been after World War II through the Marshall Plan. \u201cTrue peace,\u201d he said, would not result from military force alone but rather from new networks of roads, hospitals and schools.",
      "Mr. Bush said he understood the history of military conflict in Afghanistan. \u201cIt\u2019s been one of initial success, followed by long years of floundering and ultimate failure,\u201d he said. But he added, with a fleeting, confident smile, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to repeat that mistake.\u201d",
      "Mistakes, obviously, were nonetheless made. Among them, in the judgment of many analysts, was the Bush administration\u2019s expansion of its \u201cwar on terror\u201d to Iraq. And as the years passed, it became evident that the Afghan leaders on whom Washington had placed big bets would not be the hoped-for instruments of effective, corruption-free governance.",
      "\u201cI used to say to my guys on the Afghan desk, \u2018If we\u2019re winning, how come it don\u2019t look like we\u2019re winning?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Boucher told Retro Report.",
      "To complicate matters, the Taliban never disappeared. Slowly at first, and then with stunning speed, they regained control.",
      "\u201cThe people were not rejecting the Taliban,\u201d Mr. Boucher said. \u201cThat was, in the end, because the government couldn\u2019t deliver much for the people.\u201d",
      "Well before recent weeks, he said, \u201cwe should have at least asked ourselves whether it wasn\u2019t really time for us to leave, to say to the Afghans, \u2018It\u2019s your place. You run it as best as you can.\u2019\u201d",
      "Now the world is left to wonder whether the relatively moderate image that Taliban leaders have sought to project in recent days should be taken seriously. Or will they, instead, revert to the thuggery of the past, with dissidents killed, ancient monuments leveled, women denied jobs and compelled to wear burqas, and girls forced to leave school?",
      "What lasting lessons the United States has learned remain similarly unclear. For one thing, the congressional vote in 2001 that gave the president open-ended license to use military force is still in force; it has been used as a basis for the deployment of American soldiers to Ethiopia, Somalia, Yemen and many other countries.",
      "Across the years, Representative Lee has introduced legislation to revoke this blanket authorization for the White House. She managed to succeed in the House in 2019, but the effort then failed in the Senate.",
      "Her view 20 years ago, she told Retro Report, was that \u201cwe need to think through our military response, our national security response, and the possible impact on civilians.\u201d",
      "On that score, she seems unchanged from when she rose in Congress in 2001 to say: \u201cHowever difficult this vote may be, some of us must urge the use of restraint. Our country is in a state of mourning. Some of us must say, \u2018Let\u2019s step back for a moment, let\u2019s just pause, just for a minute, and think through the implications of our actions today, so that this does not spiral out of control.\u2019\u201d",
      "At the time, \u201csome of us\u201d ended up being \u201cone of us\u201d \u2014 just her."

    "title": "F.D.A. Fully Approves Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s Vaccine, a First for a Covid-19 Shot",
    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Food and Drug Administration on Monday granted full approval to Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s coronavirus vaccine for people 16 and older, a decision that is likely to set off a cascade of vaccine requirements by hospitals, colleges and universities, corporations and other organizations.",
      "Within hours, the Pentagon, CVS, the State University of New York system and the New York City school system, among others, announced that they would enforce mandates they had prepared but made contingent on the F.D.A.\u2019s action.",
      "The approval came as the nation\u2019s fight against the pandemic has intensified again, with the highly infectious Delta variant biting deeply into the progress that the country had made over the first half of the year. The Biden administration hopes the development will motivate at least some of the roughly 85 million Americans who are eligible for shots but have so far rejected them to change their minds.",
      "The regulatory move goes a step beyond the emergency use authorization that the agency granted in December. More than 92 million people have already been fully vaccinated since then with Pfizer doses. Some who have rejected the vaccines, expressing fears that they are experimental, have said they wanted to wait until the agency spent more time studying their safety and fully approved them.",
      "In a roughly 10-minute address on the approval, President Biden said it should sweep away any lingering doubts about vaccines and spur more mandates. Appealing to corporate, state and local leaders, he said: \u201cDo what I did last month. Require your employees to get vaccinated or face strict requirements.\u201d In late July, he announced that all federal employees and on-site contractors must be vaccinated against the coronavirus or be required to submit to regular testing and other measures.",
      "Mr. Biden tried to cast the F.D.A. approval as an example of how his administration was making headway against the pandemic, despite overflowing intensive care units in some states and an average of more than 1,000 lives a day lost. He said the death toll, while rising, was still far lower than it was last winter, because more than nine in ten older Americans are now vaccinated.",
      "With the F.D.A. yet to authorize a vaccine even on an emergency basis for children younger than 12, Mr. Biden also tried to reassure anxious parents about the growing number of children who are getting infected with the Delta variant, saying that severe Covid-19 cases in that age group are still \u201cvery, very rare.\u201d He also promised to soon address \u201chow we get our kids back to school safely.\u201d",
      "The F.D.A., which has been under pressure to speed up its evaluations of coronavirus vaccines, gave full approval to Pfizer\u2019s just 97 days after the company submitted the last of what regulators said were hundreds of thousands of documents. Officials said they were able to decide the matter in less than half the usual time because regulators worked nights and weekends and added staff members, not because they cut corners.",
      "\u201cThis is a pivotal moment for our country in the fight against the pandemic,\u201d Dr. Janet Woodcock, the acting F.D.A. commissioner, told reporters. \u201cThe public can be confident that this vaccine meets the F.D.A.\u2019s gold standard for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality that we require for an approved product.\u201d",
      "Some health experts are worried that the approval will unleash a wave of demands from vaccine recipients who want their doctors to prescribe booster doses. The federal government plans to begin rolling out third shots to people who had their second shot eight months earlier, but only after the F.D.A. clears extra doses and not until Sept. 20.",
      "\u201cI think we just have to keep people calm,\u201d said Dr. Jesse L. Goodman, a former chief scientist at the F.D.A. and now a medical professor at Georgetown University. He noted that more than one million Americans had already managed to get extra shots on their own and that demand could be difficult to control.",
      "Ordinarily, final approval could give doctors a certain measure of freedom to prescribe a drug differently than the label advises. Pfizer is also ostensibly now free to market the vaccine, under the brand name Comirnaty.",
      "In this case, though, as both Pfizer and the F.D.A. noted, the federal government controls the distribution of the vaccine in the United States. Dr. Woodcock strongly discouraged people from seeking a third shot until the F.D.A. has ruled on whether extra shots are safe and effective for the general adult population.",
      "She specifically warned against giving the vaccine to children under 12, saying that doing so would be \u201cof great concern\u201d because regulators have not collected enough data yet from clinical trials on safety or the proper dose. Trials are still in progress for that age group, and a regulatory decision about emergency use could be several months away.",
      "\u201cWe certainly want to make sure that we get it right in the children ages 5 through 11,\u201d said Dr. Peter Marks, the F.D.A.\u2019s top vaccine regulator, \u201cand then even in younger children after that.\u201d",
      "The vaccine is still authorized for emergency use, instead of fully approved, for children 12 to 15.",
      "Pfizer said it presented the F.D.A. with data from 44,000 clinical trial participants \u2014 half of whom got the vaccine, the other half a placebo \u2014 in the United States, the European Union, Turkey, South Africa and South America. The F.D.A. said the data showed the vaccine was 91 percent effective in preventing disease. That was a slight drop from the 95 percent efficacy rate in December, when the vaccine was cleared for emergency use. Pfizer said the decrease reflected the fact that researchers had more time to catch people who became sick.",
      "Some public health experts were hopeful that the decision could push some of those hesitant about getting vaccinated off the fence.",
      "Even if only 5 percent more Americans were persuaded to get shots, as some experts have predicted, \u201cthat\u2019s still a huge slice of people,\u201d said Dr. Thomas Dobbs, the chief health officer for Mississippi. Like a number of other Southern states, his has been ravaged by the Delta variant. He said licensure would help \u201cshake loose this false assertion that the vaccines are an \u2018experimental\u2019 thing.\u201d",
      "A recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, which has been tracking public attitudes during the pandemic, found that three of every 10 unvaccinated people said they would be more likely to get vaccinated with a shot that had been fully approved. But the pollsters and other experts warned that far fewer Americans might actually be swayed by the approval.",
      "\u201cI think that is a vanishingly small number of people in real life\u201d who would change their minds because of the vaccine\u2019s regulatory status, said Alison Buttenheim, an associate professor of nursing at the University of Pennsylvania and an expert on vaccine hesitancy. But if full approval spurs more requirements from employers and other organizations, she said, the results could be more significant.",
      "\u201cWe still have a lot of people who just haven\u2019t gotten around to it or don\u2019t have huge objections, but no one\u2019s told them they have to\u201d get vaccinated, she said. \u201cMandates simplify things for people.\u201d",
      "Already on Monday, the Pentagon announced that the country\u2019s 1.4 million active-duty troops would have to be vaccinated, and Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey said that all teachers in that state would have to get shots or submit to weekly testing. Chevron and CVS both said they would require some of their employees to receive coronavirus vaccines, and the State University of New York and the University of Minnesota systems announced similar requirements for students.",
      "Wall Street rose, with investors buoyed by the vaccine news. The S&P 500 stock index was up almost 1 percent, and shares of Pfizer climbed 2.5 percent.",
      "\u201cThe full regulatory approval of the Pfizer vaccine created hopes that it may spur additional gains in vaccination rates in the U.S., which would be an economic positive going forward,\u201d said John Canavan, the lead analyst at Oxford Economics.",
      "So far, 54 percent of Americans who have been fully inoculated have gotten Pfizer shots. Most of the rest received Moderna\u2019s vaccine, which also requires two doses.",
      "Dr. Marks said that federal health agencies would continue to monitor the Pfizer vaccine\u2019s safety. The F.D.A. will also require Pfizer to continue to study the risk of myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis, an inflammation of the membrane surrounding the heart, in people who get its shot, including long-term outcomes for those who fall ill after vaccination. The F.D.A. in June attached warnings to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines noting possible increased risk of both conditions after the second dose.",
      "Less than two months after it appeared to have curbed the spread of the virus, the United States is averaging around 150,000 new cases a day and more than 90,000 hospitalized Covid-19 patients. Exactly two months ago, before the Delta variant fully took hold, federal health experts said the nation would be highly unlikely to again face a death toll of 1,000 or more people a day. The seven-day average as of Sunday was 1,008 daily deaths, according to a New York Times database.",
      "\u201cFull approval could not come at a more important time,\u201d said Dr. Richard Besser, the president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and a former acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He called on schools and businesses to require vaccination before allowing people to congregate indoors.",
      "Vaccination rates have been rising steadily in recent weeks as fear of the Delta variant has grown. Providers were administering about 837,000 shots a day late last week, and Mr. Biden said the most recent seven-day total was the highest since early July. He said more people in Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi \u2014 some of the states with the highest caseloads \u2014 got their first shots in the past month than in the previous two months combined.",
      "Dr. Marks said that myths about the vaccines remain a major impediment to fighting the pandemic, including false claims that shots would cause infertility, would foster rather than prevent Covid-19, and had even led to thousands of deaths.",
      "\u201cLet me be clear: These claims are simply not true,\u201d he said.",
      "The F.D.A. is in the midst of a blizzard of decisions about coronavirus vaccines. The next major one looming is whether to authorize booster shots.",
      "The Biden administration said last week it planned to offer third shots to adults who got the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, eight months after their second injection, starting Sept. 20. Third shots are already authorized for some people with immune deficiencies, but the risk-benefit calculus is different for the general population.",
      "Federal health officials said that both Pfizer\u2019s and Moderna\u2019s vaccines, which rely on similar technology, wane in potency over time. That trend, they said, is converging with the rise of the particularly dangerous Delta variant, making those who completed their vaccinations at the start of the year increasingly vulnerable to infection.",
      "Some public health experts have challenged the plan for booster shots as premature. They say the available data shows that the vaccines are holding up well against severe disease and hospitalization, including against the Delta variant. Extra shots would be warranted only if the vaccines failed to meet that standard, some have said.",
      "Regulators are still reviewing Moderna\u2019s application for full approval of its vaccine, which it filed in June, a month after Pfizer. That decision could take several weeks. Johnson & Johnson is expected to apply for full approval soon."

    "title": "The U.S. will advise most Americans to get booster shots eight months after vaccination.",
    "content": [
      "More than five million Americans could be eligible for booster shots of Covid-19 vaccine by late September under a Biden administration plan to combat the Delta variant by giving extra doses eight months after initial vaccinations.",
      "Officials are expected to announce the strategy at a White House briefing on Wednesday. Nursing home residents, health care workers and emergency workers would probably be first in line. Other older people would be next, followed by the rest of the general population.",
      "But the plan depends on several crucial steps taking place in the next few weeks. Most important, the Food and Drug Administration would need to decide that third shots are safe and effective for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, the two vaccines that were rolled out first and have been most used.",
      "Pfizer is farther along in submitting data to the F.D.A. that it says supports the use of boosters. Moderna and the National Institutes of Health are still studying whether a half-dose or a full dose would work better for a third shot, but they expect results soon. Moderna\u2019s chief executive, St\u00e9phane Bancel, has said the firm plans to submit its data to the F.D.A. next month.",
      "Officials envision giving people the same vaccine they originally received, using pharmacies as key distribution points.",
      "Administration officials are discouraging people from seeking booster doses on their own, noting that the F.D.A. has yet to rule on their safety and efficacy. Nonetheless, the C.D.C. says that more than a million Americans have already obtained them, apparently by pretending they were unvaccinated. The officials hope to roll out extra shots in an orderly way, so that people get a booster shot when it is recommended, not simply based on their own fears.",
      "Dr. Danny Avula, the vaccine coordinator for the state of Virginia, said that his state had thousands of vaccine providers already in place and could most likely manage boosters without much change. \u201cWhat caused so much of the urgency and frenzy of January through April was the limitations in supply,\u201d he said.",
      "The government has more than 100 million doses stockpiled that could be used for boosters, along with tens of millions more doses that have already been delivered to pharmacies and other locations. Even more supply is scheduled for delivery this fall.",
      "In interviews on Tuesday, hospital officials and doctors were supportive of the push for booster shots.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re running out of second chances,\u201d said Dr. Matthew Harris, the medical director of the coronavirus vaccination program at Northwell Health, New York\u2019s largest hospital system. \u201cWhat keeps me up at night is the inevitability of a variant that is not responsive to the vaccine, so if this is how we stay ahead of it, I fully support it.\u201d",
      "Federal officials envision offering additional shots to recipients of the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine, as well as those who got Moderna or Pfizer. But the government began offering the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in March, months later than the others, and only 14 million people have gotten it. By comparison, 155 million people have been fully vaccinated with either Pfizer or Moderna.",
      "Data from a Johnson & Johnson clinical trial in which participants were given two doses is likely to be submitted to the F.D.A. later this month and will guide the government\u2019s recommendation on that vaccine.",
      "At Wednesday\u2019s briefing, administration officials plan to make the case that a booster strategy is essential, even if it must be amended as more data comes in. They are expected to present data showing that vaccine efficacy is declining even though unvaccinated people still make up the vast majority of those who become seriously ill or are hospitalized."

      "Echoing several other top U.S. officials in recent days, John F. Kirby, a Defense Department spokesman, noted to reporters on Friday that Afghan government forces had numerical and firepower advantages over the Taliban and suggested they should be able to stop the onslaught if only they tried hard enough.",
      "\u201cWe will do what we can from the air, but they have the advantage. They have greater numbers. They have an air force. They have modern weaponry,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time now to use those advantages.\u201d",
      "A day earlier, Mr. Kirby was more explicit. \u201cNo potential outcome has to be inevitable, including the fall of Kabul,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be that way. It really depends on the kind of political and military leadership that the Afghans can muster to turn this around.\u201d",
      "President Biden has spoken in similar terms, saying on Tuesday that Afghan forces \u201chave got to want to fight.\u201d The next day, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said the Afghans \u201chave what they need,\u201d but must determine whether they have \u201cthe political will to fight back.\u201d",
      "But Afghan forces are suffering from shattered morale, diminishing supplies, and the shock of a war they are losing much faster than all but the most pessimistic analysts expected.",
      "And privately, many U.S. officials are growing increasingly doubtful that the Afghan forces can rally to mount a defense of Kabul, which could potentially force a stalemate and an eventual political settlement.",
      "That attitude is reflected by the increasingly frantic preparations underway for the worst-case scenario of a Taliban takeover of the capital city.",
      "U.S. officials on Thursday announced the deployment of 3,000 troops to begin evacuating Americans from Kabul, and are accelerating plans to relocate Afghans who worked with U.S. military forces, and who may be eligible for Special Immigrant Visas to resettle in the United States. Some 20,000 Afghans have applied for the visas, which take months to process, leaving them vulnerable to potential Taliban reprisals while they wait. Many live in Kabul.",
      "People familiar with the planning say that State Department officials have been working virtually around the clock to expedite what U.S. officials have called Operation Allies Refuge.",
      "Nearly 700 Afghans have landed in the Washington area on four flights so far, with most moving on to Fort Lee in Virginia. About 1,750 more are expected to arrive at Fort Lee over the next 10 days, according to the sources familiar with the planning.",
      "The State Department said this month that thousands of Afghans with American ties who did not qualify for the Special Immigrant Visa program, including people who worked for U.S.-based media organizations and nongovernmental organizations, would be eligible for priority refugee status.",
      "But those Afghans must apply for refugee status from outside of Afghanistan \u2014 a prospect that has become far more daunting as the Taliban seize control of more territory, roads and border crossings, making it dangerous to try to leave the country. Many of Afghanistan\u2019s neighbors have also turned back refugees fleeing the Taliban advances.",
      "Refugee advocates and former U.S. officials who have worked in Afghanistan said they had been inundated with messages from panicking Afghans with Western ties looking for assistance in fleeing the country. The Taliban have been accused of massacring their political enemies after their battlefield victories.",
      "In another sign of alarm, Politico reported that the staff at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul had been instructed to begin burning documents. A State Department spokesman did not deny the report but said, without discussing specifics, that the embassy was following the standard operating procedure for diplomatic posts worldwide that are ordered to shrink their footprint.",
      "But the spokesman did say that Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken had not urged Afghanistan\u2019s president, Ashraf Ghani, to resign during a Thursday phone call that Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III had also joined.",
      "The Taliban have made Mr. Ghani\u2019s resignation one of their key demands at peace talks with Afghan government officials that began in 2019, and have thus far proved fruitless.",
      "White House officials said on Friday that Mr. Biden\u2019s national security team had briefed him on conditions in the country.",
      "But while the White House has maintained an external sense of calm, officials are keenly aware of the growing sense of political danger for Mr. Biden as cable news networks devote more airtime to the Taliban surge and an increasingly chaotic American exit.",

      "It was the end of a decades-long American military engagement overseas, and thousands of U.S. allies were clamoring to board the last planes leaving for, they hoped, eventual resettlement in the United States. Their capital had fallen. Deadly reprisals for those who stayed behind were almost certain.",
      "It was 1975, the tumultuous backdrop was Southeast Asia, and Washington largely opened America\u2019s doors, letting in some 300,000 refugees from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia over the next four years. Joseph R. Biden Jr., then a young senator from Delaware, co-sponsored landmark legislation that won unanimous passage in the Senate and was signed into law in 1980, divorcing refugee admissions from U.S. foreign policy and generally expanding the number allowed into the country each year.",
      "Now, as similar scenes of chaos and desperation unfold in Kabul with the conclusion of America\u2019s 20-year war in Afghanistan, most analysts say there is little chance the country will repeat the extensive refugee resettlement effort that accompanied the end of the war in Vietnam.",
      "Decades of lukewarm public sentiment over refugees, a toxic political stalemate over immigration and contemporary concerns over terrorism and the coronavirus pandemic have all but eliminated the possibility of a similar mass mobilization.",
      "Since the 1930s, polling by Gallup has shown time and again that Americans are ambivalent toward accepting refugees. As recently as 2018, amid a surge of Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans seeking safe haven, Americans said they would rather accept ordinary immigrants coming to look for better lives than refugees fleeing war and violence, according to the Pew Research Center \u2014 the opposite of respondents in 16 other Western countries.",
      "The refugee law that Mr. Biden co-sponsored calls for the president to determine the number of refugee admissions for a given year based on humanitarian concerns or what is otherwise in the national interest, giving the White House wide latitude.",
      "When the program began in 1980, the U.S. capped the number of refugees at 234,000. But that limit has trended generally downward since, hitting what many thought would be a low of 15,000 in the last year of the presidency of Donald J. Trump, whose hostility to all kinds of immigration was a cornerstone of his administration.",
      "Mr. Biden ran on a pledge to adopt a more humane policy and rebuild the resettlement program, but the country is poised to admit the lowest number of refugees in the history of the program \u2014 there have been 6,246 through July 31 \u2014 partly because the pandemic closed consulates and delayed processing of applications.",
      "The crisis conditions in Afghanistan have prompted urgent calls to resettle Afghans who are trying urgently to leave before a Taliban crackdown, starting with the translators and others who face retribution because of their work with the U.S. military.",
      "\u201cPresident Biden has said, \u2018America is back\u2019 \u2014 is the city on the hill. Now he has the chance to prove it,\u201d said Ryan Crocker, whose long diplomatic career included stints as U.S. ambassador to both Iraq and Afghanistan.",
      "More than a dozen governors from both parties have expressed a willingness to receive refugees, and faith-based groups across the country are volunteering to help sponsor Afghan families. Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, said that Utah had \u201ca long history of welcoming refugees from around the world\u201d and was \u201ceager to continue that practice\u201d with Afghan refugees.",
      "But with large numbers of people fleeing violence and poverty in Central America and other countries pushing recently across the border with Mexico, some conservatives are calling for a hard line against large numbers of Afghan refugees.",
      "Representative Tom Tiffany of Wisconsin, a Republican, said he was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d that thousands of Afghans could be transported to Fort McCoy in his state without appropriate screening and called on the White House to abandon \u201cthis dangerous ready-fire-aim plan.\u201d",
      "And Fox News\u2019s Tucker Carlson warned that admitting refugees now could eventually result in \u201cmillions\u201d of Afghan immigrants. \u201cSo first we invade, and then we are invaded.\u201d",
      "What obligation, if any, does the United States have to accept people from other countries who are fleeing for their lives? None legally. There is no international law that requires the United States to take in refugees.",
      "Yet, since the aftermath of World War II, it has played a leading role in welcoming refugees, especially from countries where it engaged militarily in the service of strategic and geopolitical considerations.",
      "Between 1945 and 1950, the United States admitted about 350,000 Europeans, mainly Jews who survived the Holocaust.",
      "President Dwight D. Eisenhower paroled some 40,000 Hungarians into the United States, and President John F. Kennedy went on to allow several hundred thousand Cubans opposed to the regime of Fidel Castro. Then came Vietnam and the exodus of hundreds of thousands of boat people after the fall of Saigon.",
      "In all of those cases, refugees were casualties of America\u2019s Cold War campaign against Communism, and they enjoyed a certain amount of public support.",
      "\u201cDuring the \u201980s, refugees are relatively popular because they are seen as a symbol of the superiority of our political and economic system,\u201d said Serena Parekh, the author of two books on refugees, including \u201cNo Refuge: Ethics and the Global Refugee Crisis,\u201d published last year. \u201cThey are part of Cold War politics and play well into national interests.\u201d",
      "In the late 1980s, the United States received tens of thousands of Soviet Jews and other religious minorities for whom the American public had sympathy. In the 1990s, there was an influx from the conflict in the former Yugoslavia.",
      "But by the late 1990s, the Congressional Black Caucus was criticizing the program for not assisting enough Africans fleeing bloodshed in countries like Somalia, forcing them to remain parked in teeming camps. Public attitudes toward refugees already were shifting, said Dr. Parekh, a professor at Northeastern University.",
      "\u201cRefugees start to look more foreign or dissimilar to people in the U.S.,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead of being seen as people courageously fleeing persecution, they are seen as people who will be an economic burden.\u201d",
      "In response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the United States invaded Afghanistan; two years later it invaded Iraq.",
      "Back home, public concern grew when immigrants \u2014 not refugees \u2014 were involved in a handful of other deadly terror attacks. The administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama added layers of security checks to the application process.",
      "\u201cThe refugee program became so mired in red tape and extreme vetting that it looks like a program designed to keep people out of the United States rather than rescue them,\u201d said Mark Hetfield, the chief executive of HIAS, a resettlement agency founded as Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, who has worked in the field for 32 years.",
      "After terrorist attacks in Paris in 2015, more than 20 governors announced that their states would not accept refugees from Syria, fearing terrorist infiltrators.",
      "Not long after taking office, Mr. Trump slashed the refugee cap to 50,000 from the 110,000 set by Mr. Obama, and issued an executive order barring the entry of people from several predominantly Muslim countries. The next year, he set a ceiling of 45,000; fewer than half arrived amid tighter background checks and restrictions.",
      "Mr. Biden quickly began to undo his predecessor\u2019s immigration policies, but rising public concern over the rapid increase in unauthorized crossings on the southwestern border prompted him to defer a plan to increase the cap on refugees this year.",
      "The delay forced 700 refugees, already screened and holding tickets, to be pulled off flights. There was swift rebuke from human rights activists and fellow Democrats, and within hours, the White House announced that the 2021 cap would be raised to 62,500. But it was not clear whether, given the pandemic, the program\u2019s depletion by his predecessor and soaring numbers at the border, this number would be achieved.",
      "As of March 31, the latest data available, 20,829 Afghans, plus 52,799 family members, had received special immigrant visas since 2014 under a separate program created by Congress for those who could face reprisals for their work with U.S. troops.",

      "Mr. Biden said on Wednesday that the United States hoped to evacuate between 50,000 and 65,000 Afghan allies, including their families, and had approved an additional $500 million to help with \u201curgent refugee and migration needs.\u201d",

    "content": [
      "KABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 The Pentagon is moving 3,000 Marines and soldiers to Afghanistan and another 4,000 troops to the region to evacuate most of the American Embassy and U.S. citizens in Kabul, as the Biden administration braces for a possible collapse of the Afghan government within the next month, administration and military officials said.",
      "The sharply deteriorating situation in the country, as the Taliban rapidly advance across the north and Afghan security forces battle to defend ever shrinking territory in the south and west, has forced the Biden administration to accelerate plans to get Americans out.",
      "President Biden, after meeting with his top national security advisers on Wednesday night and again Thursday morning, also ordered additional expedited flights out of the country for Afghans who have worked with the United States, so that their applications for special immigrant visas could be evaluated.",
      "The embassy sent the latest in a series of alarming alerts, urging Americans to \u201cleave Afghanistan immediately using available commercial flight options.\u201d",
      "And in Washington, the State Department spokesman, Ned Price, announced what he described as a drawdown of an unspecified number of civilians among the roughly 4,000 embassy personnel \u2014 including about 1,400 American citizens \u2014 to begin immediately.",
      "\u201cAs we\u2019ve said all along, the increased tempo of the Taliban military engagements and the resulting increase in violence and instability across Afghanistan is of grave concern,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been evaluating the security situation every day to determine how best to keep those serving at our embassy safe.\u201d",
      "But, Mr. Price added, \u201cLet me be very clear about this: The embassy remains open.\u201d",
      "American negotiators are also trying to extract assurances from the Taliban that they will not attack the U.S. Embassy in Kabul if they take over the country\u2019s government and ever want to receive foreign aid, three American officials said.",
      "The 30-day estimate is one scenario, and administration and military officials insist that the fall of Kabul might still be prevented if the Afghan security forces can muster the resolve to put up more resistance. But while Afghan commandos have managed to continue fighting in some areas, they have largely folded in a number of northern provincial capitals.",
      "The Taliban seized the strategic city of Ghazni, about 90 miles south of Kabul, on Thursday, putting the group in a better position to attack Kabul after its recent string of victories in the north.",
      "By the end of the day, the Taliban were also on the verge of taking Kandahar, the country\u2019s second-largest city, and Herat, in western Afghanistan near the Iranian border. Kandahar is historically and strategically important. The Taliban, led by Mullah Mohammad Omar, began their insurgency there in the 1990s.",
      "A senior official in the Biden administration said in an interview that the Taliban might soon take Mazar-i-Sharif, the capital of Balkh Province and the country\u2019s economic engine, which is now effectively surrounded by the Taliban. The fall of Mazar-i-Sharif and Kandahar, the official said, could lead to a surrender of the Afghan government by September.",
      "Another senior U.S. official described the mood in the White House as a combination of alarm and resignation \u2014 at the rapid pace of the Taliban offensive and the collapse of Afghan national forces, and over how the situation could continue to worsen. There has been a constant stream of video teleconference calls every day this week, the official said.",
      "American officials conceded that they greatly overestimated the ability of the Afghan national forces to hold off the Taliban for at least a year or so. The collapse, they said, was almost instantaneous. But they argued that Mr. Biden accurately assessed the ultimate outcome: that if Americans stayed, they would get caught in the crossfire of yet another Afghan civil war.",
      "The Pentagon press secretary, John F. Kirby, said that two Marine infantry battalions and one Army battalion, some 3,000 troops altogether, would deploy in the next two days to Hamid Karzai International Airport to help evacuate Americans and embassy personnel. The troops are coming from areas in the Middle East, the Central Command area of responsibility, Mr. Kirby said.",
      "An additional 1,000 Army personnel will head to Qatar, the Pentagon said, to help process the visa applications of Afghan who worked with American military during the war and who could be targeted by surging Taliban forces.",
      "And as a contingency plan in case any embassy evacuation turns into a fight with the Taliban, the Pentagon is moving an entire infantry brigade combat team \u2014 some 3,500 troops \u2014 from Fort Bragg to Kuwait in the next week, so that they can quickly deploy if necessary.",
      "If those troops end up in Afghanistan, that would bring the number of American forces there to around 7,000, more than double the number in the country when Mr. Biden announced in April that he would withdraw American troops and end America\u2019s longest war.",
      "The deployment is \u201ca very narrowly focused mission of safeguarding the orderly reduction of civilian personnel out of Afghanistan,\u201d Mr. Kirby said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re going to be focused on. It\u2019s not a combat mission.\u201d",
      "A Marine battalion of several hundred is already on the embassy grounds, responsible for evacuating the embassy, officials said.",
      "\u201cWe believe this is that the prudent thing to do given the rapidly deteriorating security situation,\u201d Mr. Kirby said.",
      "In the Biden administration\u2019s aspirational plan for Afghanistan, none of this was supposed to happen \u2014 at least not so quickly. Mr. Biden announced in April that American troops would withdraw from the country by Sept. 11; he later moved that date up to Aug. 31, and most of the troops have left. He insisted that the Afghan government and military, with financial support from the United States, would be responsible for defending the country\u2019s urban areas from the Taliban.",
      "But since the announcement, the Taliban have rolled across city after city, despite having only around 75,000 fighters compared with the American-trained Afghan security forces\u2019 300,000 troops. That dichotomy has caused frustration in the Pentagon and among American officials, who have repeatedly said that the Afghan troops, if their backs were to the wall, would rally to defeat the Taliban.",
      "\u201cThey have a lot of advantages that the Taliban don\u2019t have,\u201d Mr. Kirby said this week, referring to Afghanistan\u2019s national security forces. \u201cTaliban doesn\u2019t have an air force, Taliban doesn\u2019t own airspace. They have a lot of advantages. Now, they have to use those advantages.\u201d",
      "But President Ashraf Ghani\u2019s administration has failed to carry out any kind of strategy to defend what cities that remain or retake them despite saying he would do so. Pro-government militia forces, championed by Afghan officials and reminiscent of the bloody civil war of the 1990s, have consistently been unable to push back the Taliban.",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Ghani replaced the country\u2019s army chief and appointed a new commander of the military\u2019s commando units, in what has amounted to one of his most public moves yet to contend with the Taliban offensive, which has taken more than half of Afghanistan\u2019s roughly 400 districts.",
      "Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III spoke with Mr. Ghani on Thursday to coordinate planning, Mr. Price said.",
      "The American military is still supporting, to some degree, Afghanistan\u2019s government forces with airstrikes. But those strikes have largely been limited to the southern part of the country, around Kandahar. That is because of logistics: Now that the United States has withdrawn from Bagram Air Base in the north and has hauled away its warplanes and their huge support systems, it is harder to reach the north. Such strikes could require aerial refueling and would have other logistical hurdles that make them harder to conduct.",
      "Zalmay Khalilzad, the chief American envoy in talks with the Taliban, is leading the diplomatic effort for assurances from the Taliban that they will not attack the embassy. Two officials confirmed his efforts, which have not been previously reported, on the condition of anonymity to discuss the delicate negotiations.",
      "Mr. Khalilzad is hoping to convince Taliban leaders that the embassy must remain open, and secure, if the group hopes to receive American financial aid and other assistance as part of a future Afghan government. The Taliban leadership has said it wants to be seen as a legitimate steward of the country, and is seeking relations with other global powers, including Russia and China, in part to receive economic support.",
      "A third official said on Thursday that the Taliban would forfeit any legitimacy \u2014 and, in turn, foreign aid \u2014 if it attacks Kabul or takes over Afghanistan\u2019s government by force.",
      "Five current and former officials described the mood inside the embassy as increasingly tense and worried, and diplomats at the State Department\u2019s headquarters in Washington noted a sense of tangible depression at the specter of closing it, nearly 20 years after Marines reclaimed the burned-out building in December 2001.",
      "Several people gloomily revived a comparison that all wanted to avoid: the fall of Saigon in 1975, when Americans stationed at the U.S. Embassy were evacuated from a rooftop by helicopter."

      "On Javier Mackey\u2019s second deployment to Afghanistan, one of his friends was shot in an ambush and bled to death in his arms. He saw high-ranking Afghan officers selling off equipment for personal gain and Afghan troops running away during firefights. And he started wondering what the United States could really achieve by sending thousands of troops to a distant land that seemed to have never known peace. That was in 2008.",
      "Mr. Mackey, an Army Special Forces soldier, deployed there five more times, was shot twice, and, he said, grew more cynical on each trip, until he decided the only sensible thing for the United States to do was cut its losses and leave.",
      "Even so, seeing the swift and chaotic collapse of the Afghan government in recent days hit him with the intensity of a bomb blast.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pain \u2014 pain I thought I had gotten used to,\u201d said Mr. Mackey, who retired as a sergeant first class in 2018 and now lives in Florida. \u201cI sacrificed a lot, I saw death every year. And the guys I served with, we knew it would probably come to an end like this. But to see it end in chaos, it makes us angry. After everything we gave, I just wish there had been a way to leave with honor.\u201d",
      "In the 20 years that the United States military was in Afghanistan, more than 775,000 American troops deployed there, to citylike air bases and sandbag outposts on lonely mountaintops. As the Taliban swept into Kabul on Sunday, wiping away any gains made, veterans said in interviews that they watched with a roiling mix of sadness, rage and relief. Some were thankful that America\u2019s involvement in the country seemed to have ended, but were also dismayed that hard-won progress was squandered. Others were fearful for Afghan friends left behind.",
      "In interviews, text messages and on Facebook, men and women who collectively spent decades in Afghanistan said they were angry that despite a drawdown that has spanned years, the United States could not manage to exit the country with more dignity.",
      "The anguish can be especially raw because veterans often worked side by side with Afghans during the years of attempts at nation-building, and now in that nation\u2019s collapse they see the individual faces of friends who have been enveloped by the anarchy.",
      "\u201cMy heart breaks for the Afghan people,\u201d said Ginger Wallace, a retired Air Force colonel who in 2012 oversaw a program that retrained low-level Taliban fighters to clear land mines and work in other jobs that offered an alternative to combat.",
      "At the time, she thought that efforts to stabilize Afghanistan were succeeding, and that American troops would one day leave the country a better place. But her optimism slowly wore down as the Taliban gained ground.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking, absolutely. I hate to see it end like this, but you don\u2019t know what else we could have done,\u201d she said in an interview from her home in Louisville, Ky. \u201cDo we have an expectation that U.S. service members should stay and fight the Taliban when the Afghan Army won\u2019t?\u201d",
      "Ms. Wallace met her wife, Janet Holliday, while deployed in Afghanistan. The two normally watch the news each morning, but on Monday, as scenes of mayhem unfolded at the airport in Kabul, Ms. Holliday, a retired Army colonel, switched to the Food Channel.",
      "\u201cIt was too hard to watch,\u201d Ms. Holliday said, excusing herself as she became upset. \u201cI just can\u2019t help thinking about what a waste it is. I can\u2019t allow myself to think about how after all that blood and treasure, it ends like this.\u201d",
      "More than with other wars in the nation\u2019s history, Americans have been mostly insulated from the fighting in Afghanistan. There was no draft or mass mobilization. Less than 1 percent of the nation served and a disproportionate number of troops came from rural counties in the South and West, far from the seats of power.",
      "But veterans have said in interviews over the years that they were cleareyed about the challenges posed by the war, perhaps more so than the rest of the nation. They saw firsthand the deeply ingrained traditional cultures, tribal allegiances and endemic corruption that continually hobbled American efforts.",
      "Mr. Mackey agreed with President Biden\u2019s decision to withdraw, but thought the way it was done was slapdash and unprofessional.",
      "\u201cWe train to have contingencies. The way it was handled was just irresponsible,\u201d Mr. Mackey said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to have another Vietnam, we wanted to do better.\u201d",
      "Jake Wood was a 25-year-old Marine sniper deployed to a forgotten corner of Afghanistan in 2008 when he started to see how much daylight there was between the optimistic pronouncements of top American leaders and the reality of serving with Afghans on the ground.",
      "Villagers in the district center of Sangin, where he manned an outpost, seemed to have little allegiance to the Afghan government in Kabul or the American vision of democracy.",
      "\u201cWe had no idea what our mission was, even back then,\u201d said Mr. Wood, who now runs the nationwide veteran volunteering network Team Rubicon. \u201cWere we trying to defeat the Taliban? Were we nation-building? I don\u2019t think we knew.\u201d",
      "The Afghans he served with seemed to accept the uncertainty with a weary fatalism foreign to young Marines. At one point over small cups of tea, he said, he spoke with a young Afghan he served with who said Afghanistan only knows war, and when the American war ended, another would come.",
      "\u201cHe told me that maybe the Americans would come back,\u201d Mr. Wood said. Then he recalled the Afghan saying, \u201cBut if you do, I can\u2019t tell you if we\u2019ll be friends or enemies.\u201d",
      "Mr. Wood said the veterans he has been in touch with feel a mix of sadness and fury watching the fall of Kabul: sadness that the folly that seemed so obvious in the ranks took years and thousands of lives for top leaders to accept; fury that the result of that ignorance and hubris was playing out on cable television in a way that would tarnish the reputation of the nation and the hundreds of thousands of troops who fought.",
      "\u201cWe already knew we were losing the war,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now we are losing it live on TV in front of the rest of the world. That\u2019s what\u2019s so hard.\u201d"

      "A group of survivors and descendants of victims of the race massacre in Tulsa, Okla., has asked the Justice Department to take over the search for mass graves of Black residents who were killed during the rampage in 1921.",
      "The group, Justice for Greenwood, said it did not trust city officials to lead the search for the graves or to handle any remains that may be found.",
      "\u201cTo ensure the deaths of the massacre victims whose remains are found are properly and thoroughly investigated, we are calling on the Department of Justice to act as a neutral, third-party investigator and to take over the search,\u201d the group said in a letter that was signed by the three surviving victims of the massacre, as well as state legislators and community and city leaders.",
      "The Justice Department should investigate and \u201cprovide answers and findings that the massacre survivors and their descendants, and the rest of the public, can trust,\u201d they said in the letter, which was dated Friday.",
      "A spokeswoman said the Justice Department had received the letter but declined to comment.",
      "The city has been working with archaeologists and forensic anthropologists to search for and identify the remains.",
      "As many as 300 people died during the rampage, which was led by white looters who set fire to the businesses and homes of Black residents in the Greenwood neighborhood in June 1921. Greenwood, then a booming business district, comprised some 40 blocks of restaurants, hotels and theaters owned and run by Black entrepreneurs. The mob destroyed it in less than 24 hours.",
      "A spokeswoman for the city of Tulsa declined to comment on the letter because members of Justice for Greenwood have a pending lawsuit against the city demanding compensation for the losses that descendants of the victims and survivors endured.",
      "In 2018, Mayor G.T. Bynum announced that the city would conduct a search for bodies, focusing on four sites, including Oaklawn Cemetery, that had been identified as potential locations of mass graves of the victims.",
      "\u201cThe only way to move forward in our work to bring about reconciliation in Tulsa is by seeking the truth honestly,\u201d Mr. Bynum said in a statement posted on the city\u2019s website. \u201cWe are committed to exploring what happened in 1921 through a collective and transparent process.\u201d",
      "The authors of the letter to the Justice Department contended that some of those involved in the search effort, whom they did not name, were the descendants of people who \u201cboth encouraged and actively participated in the violence that destroyed Greenwood in 1921 in the first place.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe city has an obvious conflict of interest,\u201d said Damario Solomon-Simmons, the executive director of Justice for Greenwood. \u201cWe do not believe the city has the moral authority or the desire to do the right thing in this situation.\u201d",
      "Mr. Solomon-Simmons, a lawyer, is representing the three survivors and descendants of the victims in the lawsuit.",
      "The massacre followed a chance encounter between two teenagers \u2014 Dick Rowland, 19, a Black shoe shiner, and Sarah Page, 17, a white elevator operator. Mr. Rowland entered the elevator on May 31, 1921. A scream was heard from inside, and Mr. Rowland fled.",
      "Accused of sexually assaulting Ms. Page, he was arrested that morning and jailed in the Tulsa County Courthouse. A large group of armed Black people, fearful that Mr. Rowland would be lynched, rushed to the courthouse to ensure his safety.",
      "The charges against Mr. Rowland were later dropped, and the authorities eventually concluded that he had most likely tripped and stepped on Ms. Page\u2019s foot, according to a 2001 report from the Oklahoma Commission to Study the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921.",
      "But by June 1, the day after the arrest, a large mob of white Tulsans had begun setting fire to businesses in Greenwood. People were killed on the street or simply vanished.",
      "No one was ever charged. In the years and decades after the massacre, the city and the Chamber of Commerce tried to cover it up, distorting the narrative to present Black residents as the violent instigators.",
      "In June, Kary Stackelbeck, the state archaeologist, led a team that uncovered more than 30 unmarked graves at Oaklawn Cemetery.",
      "During a news conference that month, she told reporters that there were no dates or any documentation to help identify the bodies.",
      "Nineteen bodies were considered viable enough for a forensic analysis, she said.",
      "During the same news conference, Dr. Phoebe Stubblefield, a forensic anthropologist, said that only one of the bodies that had been examined showed signs of trauma \u2014 a Black male who was found with a bullet lodged in his shoulder.",
      "She said that the analysis of the bodies was preliminary and that a final report would eventually be presented to the city\u2019s public oversight committee during a public meeting.",
      "Dr. Stubblefield said the process of identifying the bodies or figuring out when and how they died was complicated in large part because there was no information about them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult project,\u201d Dr. Stubblefield said, adding that the part of the cemetery where the bodies were found was \u201cshockingly underdocumented.\u201d",
      "The body of the man who was found with the bullet was well-preserved, she said, but the remains of the other bodies that had been examined were \u201cbrittle and falling apart,\u201d making it hard to determine signs of trauma.",
      "The city reburied the bodies after the analysis, infuriating the survivors and the descendants of the victims, Mr. Solomon-Simmons said.",
      "\u201cNone of those bodies have been properly identified,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the uproar.\u201d",
      "In a letter to the City Council, Mr. Bynum said that the bodies had been \u201ctemporarily\u201d reburied as part of a plan that was approved and discussed at public meetings before the exhumation began.",
      "He said the goal was to determine whether any of the remains belonged to the victims of the massacre, a process that could take years, and to find available DNA to connect the remains with descendants.",
      "\u201cWe have been clear since we began this process a few years ago that the city of Tulsa is in this for the long haul,\u201d Mr. Bynum said. \u201cWhen you start searching for victims nearly a century after they were buried, there are not quick and easy answers.\u201d"

    "title": "Faculty at some U.S. state universities protest for more safety measures.",
    "content": [
      "At Pennsylvania State University, the faculty senate passed a resolution expressing \u201cno confidence\u201d in the school\u2019s plan to bring back students without requiring them to be vaccinated against the coronavirus.",
      "At Mississippi\u2019s public universities, the pleas of hundreds of professors to require vaccinations have been drowned out by a politically conservative drumbeat against mandates.",
      "And at Clemson University, the faculty plans to stage a protest on Wednesday, the first day of classes, to call for mandatory masks.",
      "As thousands of students begin returning to campuses around the United States for the fall, more than 500 universities have said they will require coronavirus vaccination this year.",
      "But at dozens of universities with less stringent health requirements, from Ohio to Iowa to North Carolina, professors are using protests, petitions and even resignations to press their demands for tighter coronavirus prevention methods. Much of the protest is coming in states where politicians, virtually all Republicans, have fiercely opposed vaccine or mask requirements, leaving universities with few tools to combat the spread of the virus.",
      "A vast majority of counties across the United States are experiencing either \u201csubstantial\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d transmission rates that call for indoor mask-wearing even among the vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Orientation at Clemson University prompted the faculty protest. The university asked students to protect themselves from the Delta variant by wearing masks, but few students did so at a convocation for freshmen last week, judging by a photo of the event that circulated online.",
      "\u201cWhen I see hundreds of students packed together, and you can\u2019t find a mask, I thought, \u2018we are in trouble,\u2019\u201d said Kim Paul, a biologist at Clemson, a public land-grant university in South Carolina with about 20,000 undergraduates.",
      "\u201cI think the university needs to show real leadership and push back against the governor and say, \u2018No, we are an institution of higher learning,\u2019\u201d Dr. Paul said. \u201cWe need to follow the science.\u201d",
      "A spokesman for Clemson, Joe Galbraith, said that after seeing unmasked students at the last freshman convocation on Friday, the university placed masks at every seat on Monday during a similar meeting of transfer students. \u201cParticipation was quite different,\u201d Mr. Galbraith noted.",
      "Clemson and other universities had interpreted South Carolina law as banning both vaccine and mask mandates, but a ruling on Tuesday by the South Carolina Supreme Court might change that, at least as it applies to masks.  ",
      "In a case involving the University of South Carolina, the court ruled that nothing in state law prohibits universities from requiring masks. The University of South Carolina had imposed a mask mandate, then rescinded it, after Alan Wilson, the state\u2019s attorney general, said it was a violation of state budget rules.",
      "The ruling on Tuesday applies to all public colleges in the state, including Clemson, said Dick Harpootlian, a lawyer and Democratic state senator who filed on behalf of a professor at University of South Carolina.",
      "After the ruling, Clemson announced it would require masks.",
      "In Mississippi, hundreds of faculty members signed a petition demanding that the university system require vaccination.",
      "The petition was started at Mississippi State University, where classes are set to begin this week.",
      "Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, has encouraged the state\u2019s residents to get vaccinated, but the state has declined to require vaccines on university campuses.",
      "A spokesman for Mississippi State, Sid Salter, said that about 52 percent of the student body has reported being vaccinated, a rate higher than the state population as a whole.  The figure, however, is based on responses from a subset of students, just over a third of the student body, who self-reported their vaccine status to the university.",
      "Penn State, with 40,000 undergraduates at its main campus in State College, Pa., decided not to require vaccination, even though Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, vetoed a bill that would have banned vaccine requirements. The school has imposed a mask mandate.",
      "In a letter to the Penn State community last week, Eric J. Barron, the university\u2019s president, blamed the decision on \u201cpolitical realities.\u201d",
      "\u201cState funding of our university requires a two-thirds vote of the Pennsylvania legislature, meaning that our funding relies on strong bipartisan support,\u201d Dr. Barron wrote.",
      "As if to reinforce that concern, the president pro tempore of the Pennsylvania State Senate, Jake Corman, a Republican whose district includes State College, expressed concern on Monday that state lawmakers might retaliate against the university if it mandated vaccines. Mr. Corman said he would not support funding cuts.",
      "A survey of Penn State undergraduates in State College found that 83 percent were fully vaccinated, a rate the university called \u201cpromising.\u201d The university said, however, that only 71 percent of students responded, a fact that raises questions about the results because unvaccinated students may be less likely to respond."

    "title": "Taliban Sweep in Afghanistan Follows Years of U.S. Miscalculations",
    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Biden\u2019s top advisers concede they were stunned by the rapid collapse of the Afghan army in the face of an aggressive, well-planned offensive by the Taliban that now threatens Kabul, Afghanistan\u2019s capital.",
      "The past 20 years show they should not have been.",
      "If there is a consistent theme over two decades of war in Afghanistan, it is the overestimation of the results of the $83 billion the United States has spent since 2001 training and equipping the Afghan security forces and an underestimation of the brutal, wily strategy of the Taliban. The Pentagon had issued dire warnings to Mr. Biden even before he took office about the potential for the Taliban to overrun the Afghan army, but intelligence estimates, now shown to have badly missed the mark, assessed it might happen in 18 months, not weeks.",
      "Commanders did know that the afflictions of the Afghan forces had never been cured: the deep corruption, the failure by the government to pay many Afghan soldiers and police officers for months, the defections, the soldiers sent to the front without adequate food and water, let alone arms. In the past several days, the Afghan forces have steadily collapsed as they battled to defend ever shrinking territory, losing Mazar-i-Sharif, the country\u2019s economic engine, to the Taliban on Saturday.",
      "Mr. Biden\u2019s aides say that the persistence of those problems reinforced his belief that the United States could not prop up the Afghan government and military in perpetuity. In Oval Office meetings this spring, he told aides that staying another year, or even five, would not make a substantial difference and was not worth the risks.",
      "In the end, an Afghan force that did not believe in itself and a U.S. effort that Mr. Biden, and most Americans, no longer believed would alter the course of events combined to bring an ignoble close to America\u2019s longest war. The United States kept forces in Afghanistan far longer than the British did in the 19th century, and twice as long as the Soviets \u2014 with roughly the same results.",
      "For Mr. Biden, the last of four American presidents to face painful choices in Afghanistan but the first to get out, the debate about a final withdrawal and the miscalculations over how to execute it began the moment he took office.",
      "\u201cUnder Trump, we were one tweet away from complete, precipitous withdrawal,\u201d said Douglas E. Lute, a retired general who directed Afghan strategy at the National Security Council for Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. \u201cUnder Biden, it was clear to everyone who knew him, who saw him pressing for a vastly reduced force more than a decade ago, that he was determined to end U.S. military involvement,\u201d he added, \u201cbut the Pentagon believed its own narrative that we would stay forever.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe puzzle for me is the absence of contingency planning: If everyone knew we were headed for the exits, why did we not have a plan over the past two years for making this work?\u201d",
      "From the moment that news outlets called Pennsylvania for Mr. Biden on Nov. 7, making him the next commander in chief for 1.4 million active-duty troops, Pentagon officials knew they would face an uphill battle to stop a withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan. Defense Department leaders had already been fending off Mr. Biden\u2019s predecessor, Donald J. Trump, who wanted a rapid drawdown. In one Twitter post last year, he declared all American troops would be out by that Christmas.",
      "And while they had publicly voiced support for the agreement Mr. Trump reached with the Taliban in February 2020 for a complete withdrawal this May, Pentagon officials said they wanted to talk Mr. Biden out of it.",
      "After Mr. Biden took office, top Defense Department officials began a lobbying campaign to keep a small counterterrorism force in Afghanistan for a few more years. They told the president that the Taliban had grown stronger under Mr. Trump than at any point in the past two decades and pointed to intelligence estimates predicting that in two or three years, Al Qaeda could find a new foothold in Afghanistan.",
      "Shortly after Lloyd J. Austin III was sworn in as defense secretary on Jan. 22, he and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recommended to Mr. Biden that 3,000 to 4,500 troops stay in Afghanistan, nearly double the 2,500 troops there. On Feb. 3, a congressionally appointed panel led by a retired four-star Marine general, Joseph F. Dunford Jr., publicly recommended that Mr. Biden abandon the exit deadline of May 1 and further reduce American forces only as security conditions improved.",
      "A report by the panel assessed that withdrawing troops on a strict timeline rather than how well the Taliban adhered to the agreement heightened the risk of a potential civil war once international forces left.",
      "But Mr. Biden, who had become deeply skeptical of American efforts to remake foreign countries in his years on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and as vice president, asked what a few thousand American troops could do if Kabul was attacked. Aides said he told them that the presence of the American troops would further the Afghan government\u2019s reliance on the United States and delay the day it would take responsibility for its own defense.",
      "The president told his national security team, including Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, that he was convinced that no matter what the United States did, Afghanistan was almost certainly headed into another civil war \u2014 one Washington could not prevent, but also, in his view, one it could not be drawn into.",
      "By March, Pentagon officials said they realized they were not getting anywhere with Mr. Biden. Although he listened to their arguments and asked extensive questions, they said they had a sense that his mind was made up.",
      "In late March, Mr. Austin and General Milley made a last-ditch effort with the president by forecasting dire outcomes in which the Afghan military folded in an aggressive advance by the Taliban. They drew comparisons to how the Iraqi military was overrun by the Islamic State in 2014 after American combat troops left Iraq, prompting Mr. Obama to send American forces back.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this movie before,\u201d Mr. Austin told Mr. Biden, according to officials with knowledge of the meetings.",
      "But the president was unmoved. If the Afghan government could not hold off the Taliban now, aides said he asked, when would they be able to? None of the Pentagon officials could answer the question.",
      "On the morning of April 6, Mr. Biden told Mr. Austin and General Milley he wanted all American troops out by Sept. 11.",
      "The intelligence assessments in Mr. Biden\u2019s briefing books gave him some assurance that if a bloody debacle resulted in Afghanistan, it would at least be delayed. As recently as late June, the intelligence agencies estimated that even if the Taliban continued to gain power, it would be at least a year and a half before Kabul would be threatened; the Afghan forces had the advantages of greater numbers and air power, if they could keep their helicopters and planes flying.",
      "Even so, the Pentagon moved swiftly to get its troops out, fearful of the risks of leaving a dwindling number of Americans in Afghanistan and of service members dying in a war the United States had given up for lost. Before the July 4 weekend, the United States had handed over Bagram Air Base, the military hub of the war, to the Afghans, effectively ending all major U.S. military operations in the country.",
      "\u201cAfghans are going to have to be able to do it themselves with the air force they have, which we\u2019re helping them maintain,\u201d Mr. Biden said at the time. A week later, he argued that the Afghans \u201chave the capacity\u201d to defend themselves.",
      "\u201cThe question is,\u201d he said, \u201cwill they do it?\u201d",
      "To critics of the decision, the president underestimated the importance of even a modest presence, and the execution of the withdrawal made the problem far worse.",
      "\u201cWe set them up for failure,\u201d said David H. Petraeus, the retired general who commanded the international forces in Afghanistan from 2010 until he was appointed C.I.A. director the next year. Mr. Biden\u2019s team, he argued, \u201cdid not recognize the risk incurred by the swift withdrawal\u201d of intelligence and reconnaissance drones and close air support, as well as the withdrawal of thousands of contractors who kept the Afghan air force flying \u2014 all in the middle of a particularly intense fighting season.",
      "The result was that Afghan forces on the ground would \u201cfight for a few days, and then realize there are no reinforcements\u201d on the way, he said. The \u201cpsychological impact was devastating.\u201d",
      "But administration officials, responding to such critiques, counter that the Afghan military dwarfs the Taliban, some 300,000 troops to 75,000.",
      "\u201cThey have an air force, a capable air force,\u201d something the Taliban does not have, John F. Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said on Friday. \u201cThey have modern equipment. They have the benefit of the training that we have provided for the last 20 years. It\u2019s time now to use those advantages.\u201d",
      "But by the time Mr. Kirby noted those advantages, none of them seemed to be making a difference. Feeling abandoned by the United States and commanded by rudderless leaders meant that Afghan troops on the ground \u201clooked at what was in front of them, and what was behind them, and decided it\u2019s easier to go off on their own,\u201d said retired Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the former commander of United States Central Command who oversaw the war in Afghanistan from 2016 to 2019.",
      "Mr. Biden, one administration official said, expressed frustration that President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan had not managed to effectively plan and execute what was supposed to be the latest strategy: consolidating forces to protect key cities. On Wednesday, Mr. Ghani fired his army chief, Lt. General Wali Mohammad Ahmadzai, who had only been in place for two months, replacing him with Maj. Gen. Haibatullah Alizai, a special operations commander. The commandos under General Alizai are the only troops who have consistently fought the Taliban these past weeks.",
      "Richard Fontaine, the chief executive of the Center for a New American Security, an influential Washington think tank that specializes in national security, wrote that in the end, the 20-year symbiosis between the United States and the Afghan government it stood up, supported and ushered through elections had broken down.",
      "\u201cThose highlighting the Afghan government\u2019s military superiority \u2014 in numbers, training, equipment, air power \u2014 miss the larger point,\u201d he wrote recently. \u201cEverything depends on the will to fight for the government. And that, it turns out, depended on U.S. presence and support. We\u2019re exhorting the Afghans to show political will when theirs depends on ours. And ours is gone.\u201d",
      "On Saturday, as the last major city in northern Afghanistan fell to the Taliban, Mr. Biden accelerated the deployment of 1,000 additional troops to the country to help ensure the safe evacuation of U.S. citizens and Afghans who worked for the U.S. government from Kabul.",
      "Mr. Biden released a lengthy statement in which he blamed Mr. Trump for at least part of the unfolding disaster. He said, \u201cI inherited a deal cut by my predecessor\u201d which \u201cleft the Taliban in the strongest position militarily since 2001 and imposed a May 1, 2021, deadline on U.S. forces.\u201d",
      "He said when he took office, he had a choice: abide by the deal or \u201cramp up our presence and send more American troops to fight once again in another country\u2019s civil conflict.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was the fourth president to preside over an American troop presence in Afghanistan \u2014 two Republicans, two Democrats,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cI would not, and will not, pass this war onto a fifth.\u201d"

      "Mr. Williams would lead the Southern District of New York after working as a prosecutor in the office for nearly a decade, most recently overseeing a unit that specializes in securities fraud. The office has handled some of the nation\u2019s most politically sensitive cases, including several inquiries of people close to former President Donald J. Trump.",
      "Mr. Biden also announced nominees to supervise two other offices that tend to investigate the Justice Department\u2019s more prominent cases, including Breon S. Peace, a former federal prosecutor, as the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn and Jessica D. Aber as the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, where she has worked since 2009. All three nominations would have to be confirmed by the Senate.",
      "The timing of the appointments is crucial to Mr. Biden\u2019s bid to curb gun violence and prosecute gun trafficking, the White House said in a statement announcing the nominations. The president pledged this summer to make federal tools available to the state and local authorities to combat an uptick of violent crime in big cities.",
      "\u201cThese individuals were chosen for their devotion to enforcing the law, their professionalism, their experience and credentials in this field, their dedication to pursuing equal justice for all, and their commitment to the independence of the Department of Justice,\u201d the White House said.",
      "Mr. Biden also tapped Carla B. Freedman, a prosecutor in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Northern District of New York, to lead the office, setting her up to be the first Senate-confirmed woman to fill the position.

Garland, is likely to oversee major trials of Ghislaine Maxwell, the longtime companion of Jeffrey Epstein, who was accused of helping him recruit and sexually abuse minors; and Sayfullo Saipov, the Uzbek man charged in a 2017 truck attack that killed eight people on a Manhattan bike path. The government has said it will seek the death penalty if he is convicted. Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Saipov have both pleaded not guilty.",
      "Mr. Williams has experience investigating politically sensitive cases.

    "title": "Biden Ramps Up Virus Strategy for Nursing Homes and Schools, and Urges Booster Shots",
    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Biden administration moved on multiple fronts on Wednesday to fight back against the surging Delta variant, strongly recommending booster shots for most vaccinated American adults and using federal leverage to force nursing homes to vaccinate their staffs.",
      "In remarks from the East Room of the White House, President Biden also directed his education secretary to \u201cuse all of his authority, and legal action, if appropriate,\u201d to deter states from banning universal masking in classrooms. That move is destined to escalate a fight with some Republican governors who are blocking local school districts from requiring masks to protect against the virus.",
      "The shifts in strategy reflect the administration\u2019s growing concern that the highly contagious Delta variant is erasing its hard-fought progress against the pandemic and thrusting the nation back to the more precarious point it was at earlier in the year.",
      "Thus far, Mr. Biden has been reluctant to use the federal government\u2019s power to withhold funding as a means of fighting the pandemic. But that changed Wednesday, when he said his administration would make employee vaccination a condition for nursing homes to receive Medicare and Medicaid funding. Officials said the decision would affect more than 15,000 nursing homes that employ 1.3 million workers.",
      "\u201cThe threat of the Delta virus remains real, but we are prepared, we have the tools, we can do this,\u201d Mr. Biden said in the East Room, adding, \u201cThis is no time to let our guard down.\u201d",
      "He accused politicians who were banning local school districts from requiring masks in the classroom of setting a \u201cdangerous tone,\u201d adding, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to sit by as governors try to block and intimidate educators from protecting our children.\u201d The administration is sending letters to eight states \u2014 Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Utah \u2014 challenging their efforts to ban universal masking in schools.",
      "For many Americans, the booster strategy will affect them the most. The government plans to offer third shots to adults who received the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines eight months after they received their second dose. About 150 million Americans have been fully immunized with one of those two vaccines.",
      "\u201cWe are concerned that the current strong protection against severe infection, hospitalization and death could decrease in the months ahead, especially among those who are at higher risk\u201d or who were inoculated in the early months of the vaccination campaign, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said.",
      "Assuming that regulators decide third shots are safe and effective, the effort will start Sept. 20. Officials said they were waiting on more data to decide whether the 14 million Americans who received Johnson & Johnson\u2019s single-dose vaccine should also receive an additional shot, but suggested that they would be included as well.",
      "Although some public health experts have said booster shots were prudent and expected, not all scientists are convinced it is the right move. And advocates for global health said it was morally wrong \u2014 and shortsighted \u2014 for the administration to give booster shots to Americans when so many people around the world were still waiting to be vaccinated.",
      "For state officials and health care providers, already exhausted from an 18-month battle against a novel virus that seems to shift its shape the moment it seems under control, the booster-vaccination campaign will bring a fresh round of logistical challenges. Some worried it could sidetrack efforts to vaccinate the roughly 85 million Americans who were eligible for shots but remained unvaccinated.",
      "\u201cWe now have to fight a war on two fronts,\u201d said Dr. Jos\u00e9 R. Romero, the Arkansas secretary of health. \u201cWe have to continue to press the vaccine into those groups that have not accepted it, and then have another effort to vaccinate those at high risk.\u201d",
      "The move to make employee vaccination a condition for nursing homes to receive Medicare and Medicaid funding reflects months of frustration with the comparatively low vaccination rates among nursing assistants and other workers who care for highly vulnerable people.",
      "Officials described it as the first time that Mr. Biden had threatened to withhold federal funding in order to force vaccinations.",
      "In an interview before the president spoke, Education Secretary Miguel A. Cardona described another major turning point: his department will use its civil rights enforcement arm to allow schools to require masks. The move comes as many educators and parents fear a surge in cases as the school year is about to start and as pediatric Covid cases climb.",
      "The C.D.C. has recommended that everyone in schools wears masks, regardless of their vaccination status, but some states and localities are refusing to issue rules requiring masks or preventing schools from imposing them.",
      "\u201cThe president is appalled, as I am, that there are adults who are blind to their blindness, that there are people who are putting policies in place that are putting students and staff at risk,\u201d Dr. Cardona said in the interview.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d he said, \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t be having this conversation. What we\u2019re dealing with now is negligence.\u201d",
      "Administration officials made clear that booster shots would depend upon a determination by the Food and Drug Administration that third shots are safe and effective \u2014 a ruling expected in the coming weeks. Whether those under the age of 18 will be eligible will also be up to the F.D.A. and a federal advisory committee of experts, they said.",
      "Aside from some people with weakened immune systems who have already been authorized for third shots, officials advised that fully vaccinated people wait for what they promised would be a speedy but orderly national rollout of booster shots.",
      "\u201cHere\u2019s what you need to know: If you are fully vaccinated, you still have a high degree of protection from the worst outcomes of Covid-19 \u2014 severe disease, hospitalization and death,\u201d Dr. Vivek H. Murthy, the surgeon general, said at a White House briefing. \u201cWe are not recommending that you go out and get a booster today.\u201d",
      "Dr. Walensky presented a series of studies at the briefing that she said showed the vaccines\u2019 efficacy wanes over time. Some doctors applauded the decision to offer booster shots.",
      "\u201cGiven the prevalence we have of the Delta variant, doing everything we can to keep people out of the hospital \u2014 especially those at high risk \u2014 does make sense,\u201d said Dr. Paul Biddinger, the director of the Center for Disaster Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital.",
      "But some scientists criticized the policy as overly broad, arguing that it is not clear that the general population needs a third shot.",
      "Jennifer B. Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Bloomberg School of Public Health, said the studies cited by administration officials showed that the vaccines were doing what they were intended to do \u2014 protect against severe disease and hospitalization.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the metric of, \u2018We\u2019re seeing more infection\u2019 is the right metric to be judging the efficacy of the vaccines,\u201d she said. \u201cThe right metric is, \u2018Does it prevent severe disease?\u2019\u201d",
      "The administration\u2019s move follows similar actions by Israel, Germany and France but goes against the recommendation of the World Health Organization, which is arguing extra vaccine supply should go to countries that have vaccinated far fewer of their residents.",
      "\u201cVaccine injustice is a shame on all humanity and if we don\u2019t tackle it together, we will prolong the acute stage of this pandemic for years when it could be over in a matter of months,\u201d Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the organization\u2019s director general, said at a news conference before the White House\u2019s briefing.",
      "Jeffrey D. Zients, the White House pandemic coordinator, said the administration was already donating 600 million doses of vaccines to needy countries and would continue that effort \u2014 a point Mr. Biden reiterated in the East Room.",
      "\u201cWe can take care of America and help the world at the same time,\u201d Mr. Biden said.",
      "Administration experts said the booster policy was the result of dual, disturbing trends: a decline in the vaccines\u2019 potency over time and the apparent ability of the Delta variant to somehow bypass their protection better than its predecessors.",
      "One study they cited found the vaccines\u2019 effectiveness at preventing infections among nursing home residents dropped to about 53 percent from 75 percent between spring and summer, when the Delta variant became dominant.",
      "Dr. Walensky said preliminary data from another study of more than 4,000 frontline workers suggested that the vaccines might not work as well against the Delta variant than against prior variants. In that study, a decline in vaccine efficacy against infection appeared related to the variant, not to how long ago the workers were vaccinated, she said.",
      "She also cited data from Israel showing a worsening in the infection rate among vaccinated people over time. Israel vaccinated much of its population faster than other countries, making it a potential harbinger of what is to come for the United States.",
      "Dr. Murthy said there was \u201cnothing magical\u201d about the eight-month timeline for allowing boosters, describing it simply as the best judgment of health experts. He and other officials emphasized that the overwhelming majority of hospitalizations and deaths from Covid continued to occur among the unvaccinated.",
      "\u201cProtection against severe disease and hospitalization is currently holding up pretty well,\u201d Dr. Walensky said.",
      "First in line for booster shots will be health care workers, nursing home residents and other older adults, followed by the rest of the general population. Officials envision offering the extra shots at pharmacies and other sites where initial vaccinations are already underway, rather than reopening mass vaccination sites. More than five million people could be eligible for the shots as of late September.",
      "Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the president\u2019s top medical adviser for the pandemic, said studies had shown that third shots of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines could boost the levels of antibodies that fight the virus tenfold \u2014 an increase he called \u201cremarkable.\u201d",
      "Although they promised the booster rollout would be orderly and thoughtful, federal officials are clearly racing against the clock to offer extra shots before those who were vaccinated earliest could be more vulnerable to the threat of severe disease.",
      "The F.D.A. must first authorize third doses, and an advisory committee of the C.D.C. must review the evidence and make recommendations. But neither Pfizer nor Moderna has yet submitted all the necessary data showing that third shots are safe and effective.",
      "Pfizer is expected to finish submitting its data this month. Moderna and the National Institutes of Health are studying whether a half dose or full dose works best. The company plans to submit its data next month.",
      "On the plus side, federal and state health officials said that much of the infrastructure for a rollout was already in place. Tens of thousands of pharmacies and other sites are already offering shots on a daily basis, and many state officials said they could easily expand their work.",
      "The nation\u2019s vaccine surplus also makes it unlikely that Americans will experience the kind of frenzy seen in the early weeks of the vaccine effort last winter, when older Americans desperate for shots flooded mass vaccination sites. \u201cThe bottom line is that we are prepared for boosters, and we will hit the ground running,\u201d Mr. Zients said.",
      "Some state officials sounded less sure of a smooth operation. \u201cIt\u2019s hard even to predict how strong the demand will be,\u201d said Dr. Marcus Plescia, the chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, which was briefed on the administration\u2019s plans Wednesday morning by C.D.C. experts.",
      "\u201cThe big question is, do we do community vaccination clinics again, which worked very well in the initial run,\u201d he said, \u201cor is the demand going to be a little bit more spaced out over time?\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Air Force acknowledged on Tuesday that human body parts were found in the wheel well of an American military C-17 cargo plane that took flight amid chaos at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Afghanistan\u2019s capital, Kabul.",
      "Air Force officials have not said how many people died in the episode on Monday, but said the service was investigating \u201cthe loss of civilian lives\u201d as a crowd of Afghans, desperate to escape the country after their government collapsed to the Taliban, climbed onto the plane\u2019s wings and fell from the sky after it took off.",
      "Harrowing video of the episode, recorded by the Afghan news media, has circulated around the world, instantly making the horrific scene \u2014 of American military might flying away as Afghans hung on against all hope \u2014 a symbol of President Biden\u2019s retreat from Afghanistan.",
      "\u201cWe are all contending with a human cost to these developments,\u201d Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, said at a briefing on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThe images from the past couple of days at the airport have been heartbreaking,\u201d said Mr. Sullivan, the first cabinet-level administration official to take questions from reporters since the Taliban took control of Kabul on Sunday.",
      "Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., the top military officer in charge of Afghanistan, flew to Kabul on Tuesday, where, he said, commercial flights had resumed after they were paused to secure the field. A White House official said U.S. military flights evacuated about 1,100 people on Tuesday, bringing the total so far to more than 3,200.",
      "American pilots and troops were forced to make on-the-spot decisions during the panic at the airport on Sunday and Monday. Another C-17 transport plane left Kabul late Sunday night with 640 people crowded on board, more than double the planned number, military officials said, after hundreds of Afghans who had been cleared by the State Department to be evacuated surged onto loading ramps. The pilots, determining that the immense aircraft could handle the load, decided to take off, officials said. That plane landed safely at its destination with the Afghans aboard.",
      "But the people who tried the next day on a different C-17 were not so fortunate.",
      "Early Monday morning, the gray Air Force plane \u2014 call sign REACH885 \u2014 descended onto the runway. The lumbering jet was carrying equipment and supplies for the U.S. Marines and soldiers on the ground securing the airport and helping with the evacuation of thousands of Americans and Afghans.",
      "Minutes after the plane touched down, rolled to a stop and lowered its rear ramp, hundreds, perhaps thousands of Afghans, rushed forward as the small crew watched in alarm.",
      "The crew was aware of what had happened the night before. On Monday morning, the number of people at the airport clamoring to get onto flights had swelled. The crew members feared for their safety, jumped back up into the plane and pulled up the loading ramp before they had finished unloading, officials said.",
      "By then, throngs of Afghans had climbed aboard the wings of the plane and, unbeknown to the crew, officials said, into the wheel well into which the landing gear would fold after takeoff.",
      "The crew contacted air traffic control, operated by U.S. military personnel, and the plane was cleared for takeoff, after spending only minutes on the ground.",
      "Mindful of the people hanging onto the plane, the pilots taxied slowly at first. Military Humvees rushed alongside trying to chase people away and off the plane. Two Apache helicopter gunships flew low, seeking to scare some people away from the plane or push them off with their powerful rotor wash.",
      "REACH885 accelerated and was airborne.",
      "Minutes later, however, the pilot and co-pilot realized they had a serious problem: The landing gear would not fully retract. They sent one of the crew members down to peer through a small porthole that allows them to view potential problems in the wheel well while aloft.",
      "It was then the crew saw the remains of an undetermined number of Afghans who had stowed away in the wheel well \u2014 apparently crushed by the landing gear. Scenes captured in videos of the flight showed other people plunging to their death.",
      "After the four-hour flight, the plane landed at its destination, Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which has become the hub for receiving passengers, including Americans and Afghans, eventually bound for the United States.",
      "Alerted of the tragedy on board, mental health counselors and chaplains met the anguished crew members as they disembarked.",
      "\u201cSafety officials are doing due diligence to better understand how events unfolded,\u201d Ann Stefanek, an Air Force spokeswoman, said in the statement."

    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 American negotiators are trying to extract assurances from the Taliban that they will not attack the U.S. Embassy in Kabul if the extremist group takes over the country\u2019s government and ever wants to receive foreign aid, three American officials said.",
      "The effort, led by Zalmay Khalilzad, the chief American envoy in talks with the Taliban, seeks to stave off a full evacuation of the embassy as they rapidly seize cities across Afghanistan. On Thursday, the State Department announced it was sending home an unspecified number of the 1,400 Americans stationed at the embassy and drawing down to what the agency\u2019s spokesman, Ned Price, described as a \u201ccore diplomatic presence\u201d in Kabul.",
      "The embassy also urged Americans who were not working for the U.S. government to immediately leave Afghanistan on commercial flights. The Taliban\u2019s march has put embassies in Kabul on high alert for a surge of violence in coming months, or even weeks, and forced consulates and other diplomatic missions in the country to shut down.",
      "American diplomats are now trying to determine how soon they may need to fully evacuate the embassy should the Taliban prove to be more bent on destruction than a d\u00e9tente.",
      "\u201cLet me be very clear about this: The embassy remains open,\u201d Mr. Price said on Thursday. \u201cAnd we plan to continue our diplomatic work in Afghanistan.\u201d",
      "Mr. Price said the heightened pace of the Taliban\u2019s rout, leading to increased violence and instability across Afghanistan, was of \u201cgrave concern.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo given the situation on the ground, this is a prudent step,\u201d he said.",
      "Five current and former officials described the mood inside the embassy as increasingly tense and worried, and diplomats at the State Department\u2019s headquarters in Washington noted a sense of depression at the specter of closing it, nearly 20 years after U.S. Marines reclaimed the burned-out building in December 2001.",
      "Several people gloomily revived a comparison that all wanted to avoid: the fall of Saigon in 1975, when Americans stationed at the U.S. Embassy were evacuated from a rooftop by helicopter.",
      "The fears underscore what was unfathomable just a few years ago, when thousands of American forces were in Afghanistan and the U.S. Embassy in Kabul hosted one of the largest diplomatic staffs in the world.",
      "Mr. Khalilzad is hoping to convince Taliban leaders that the embassy must remain open, and secure, if the group hopes to receive American financial aid and other assistance as part of a future Afghan government. The Taliban leadership has said it wants to be seen as a legitimate steward of the country, and is seeking relations with other global powers, including Russia and China, in part to receive economic support.",
      "Two officials confirmed Mr. Khalilzad\u2019s efforts, which have not been previously reported, on the condition of anonymity to discuss the delicate negotiations. A third official said on Thursday that the Taliban would forfeit any legitimacy \u2014 and, in turn, foreign aid \u2014 if it attacked Kabul or took over Afghanistan\u2019s government by force.",
      "Other governments are also warning the Taliban that they will not receive aid if they overrun the Afghan government, given the rampage its fighters have waged across the country in recent days. On Thursday, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas of Germany said Berlin would not give the Taliban any financial support if they ultimately rule Afghanistan with a hard-line Islamic law.",
      "In other posts around the world, U.S. diplomats said they were closely watching the perilous situation in Kabul to see how the State Department would balance its longstanding commitment to stabilizing Afghanistan against protecting the Americans who remain there as military forces withdraw.",
      "Ronald E. Neumann, who was the American ambassador to Afghanistan from 2005 to 2007, described a push and pull between the Pentagon and the State Department in similar situations, given the military\u2019s responsibility for carrying out evacuations and diplomats\u2019 duty to maintain American assistance and influence even in danger zones.",
      "\u201cIf the military goes too early, it may be unnecessary, and it may cost you a lot politically,\u201d said Mr. Neumann, who is now the president of the American Academy of Diplomacy in Washington. \u201cIf the diplomats wait too late, it looks like Saigon off the roof or the departure from Mogadishu after everything was already lost, and it puts the military people at risk. So there\u2019s no guaranteed right side.\u201d",
      "Another senior U.S. official expressed alarm this week at the fall of the provincial capitals across Afghanistan, and said that if other cities follow, particularly Mazar-i-Sharif, the only major northern city still under government control, the situation could disintegrate quickly.",
      "Officials in Washington and Kabul said the embassy was holding regular meetings of an emergency action committee, which is set up in every American diplomatic post to assess whether or how soon an evacuation may be necessary. The content of the meetings is classified because, in part, they review intelligence about specific attack scenarios.",
      "Spokespeople from the State Department headquarters in Washington and the U.S. Embassy in Kabul would not discuss how often the committee was meeting, but other officials said its members were holding discussions daily.",
      "The committee can only make recommendations, and it would be up to the embassy\u2019s top-ranking diplomat \u2014 in this case, Ross Wilson, the charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires in Kabul \u2014 to order an evacuation after consulting with senior officials in Washington. On Thursday, Mr. Wilson warned the Taliban that \u201cattempts to monopolize power through violence, fear and war will only lead to international isolation.\u201d",
      "Starting in April, the embassy began sending home nonessential employees as security became more untenable in Kabul. Other staff members have been allowed to leave, without penalty to their careers, if they feel in danger.",
      "One diplomat said a number of what he described as small military elements have recently been brought in to reinforce the embassy, which is inside what is probably already the most hardened compound in Kabul\u2019s international zone, where diplomatic missions and the Afghan government are based.",
      "At the same time, officials said, fewer diplomats are rotating into Kabul to replace colleagues who have left to further cull the number of Americans posted there. That has raised concerns in the American diplomatic corps that the embassy would have trouble recruiting staff for years to come.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a wrenching time,\u201d said Eric Rubin, the president of the union that represents career foreign service officers and who is a former ambassador to Bulgaria. He said about one-quarter of the current U.S. diplomatic corps have been posted to either Afghanistan or Iraq over the last 20 years and remain emotionally invested in the war zones in which they worked.",
      "\u201cThere was a lot of sacrifice,\u201d Mr. Rubin said. \u201cEveryone who served there for the most part served without their families, and under difficult conditions; at times under mortar fire. So it wasn\u2019t easy.\u201d",
      "As recently as last month, senior officials at the embassy in Kabul voiced confidence that personnel there could be evacuated quickly if necessary, noting a sufficient number of commercial flights leaving from the capital\u2019s international airport every day could accommodate the compound\u2019s staff.",
      "It is not clear, however, whether an evacuation would include all of the embassy\u2019s foreign personnel along with American citizens, and the fate of Afghan employees who would all but certainly be targeted by the Taliban for aiding the United States is of acute concern to senior officials, according to several people familiar with the discussions.",
      "Officials also said the Biden administration is concerned that an evacuation of the American Embassy could create a domino effect that accelerates the departure of other diplomatic missions and international support \u2014 and, in turn, leads to the collapse of the Afghan government.",
      "\u201cI am quite sure that no one in our Foreign Service who\u2019s involved in this effort is advocating closing down the embassy and evacuating,\u201d Mr. Rubin said.",
      "While decisions about the embassy\u2019s security are on the horizon, he said, \u201cthere\u2019s no reason to think that there\u2019s an imminent security threat to our people.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe first thing is, obviously, the mission, and the mission is changing,\u201d Mr. Rubin said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s going to propose to walk away.\u201d"

    "content": [
      "With climate change and long-term drought continuing to take a toll on the Colorado River, the federal government on Monday for the first time declared a water shortage at Lake Mead, one of the river\u2019s main reservoirs.",
      "The declaration triggers cuts in water supply that, for now, mostly will affect Arizona farmers. Beginning next year they will be cut off from much of the water they have relied on for decades. Much smaller reductions are mandated for Nevada and for Mexico across the southern border.",
      "But larger cuts, affecting far more of the 40 million people in the West who rely on the river for at least part of their water supply, are likely in coming years as a warming climate continues to reduce how much water flows into the Colorado from rain and melting snow.",
      "\u201cAs this inexorable-seeming decline in the supply continues, the shortages that we\u2019re beginning to see implemented are only going to increase,\u201d said Jennifer Pitt, who directs the Colorado River program at the National Audubon Society. \u201cOnce we\u2019re on that train, it\u2019s not clear where it stops.\u201d",
      "The Bureau of Reclamation, an agency of the Interior Department, declared the shortage as it issued its latest outlook for the river for the next 24 months. That forecast showed that by the end of this year Lake Mead, the huge reservoir near Las Vegas, would reach a level of 1,066 feet above sea level. It hasn\u2019t seen a level that low since it began to fill after the completion of Hoover Dam in the 1930s. The lake will be at 34 percent of capacity.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s announcement highlights the challenges we face in the Colorado River basin and elsewhere in the West,\u201d said Tanya Trujillo, assistant interior secretary for water and science.",
      "Water levels at Lake Mead and the other large Colorado reservoir, Lake Powell, in Utah, have been falling for years, leaving a telltale white \u201cbathtub ring\u201d of mineral deposits along the shoreline as demand has outpaced supply.",
      "The mandatory cuts, referred to as Tier 1 reductions, are part of a contingency plan approved in 2019 after lengthy negotiations among the seven states that use Colorado River water: California, Nevada and Arizona in the lower basin, and New Mexico, Utah, Colorado and Wyoming in the upper basin. American Indian tribes and Mexican officials have also been involved in the planning.",
      "The shortage announced Monday affects only the lower basin states, but the Bureau of Reclamation may declare a similar shortage for the upper basin, perhaps as early as next year.",
      "The shortage declaration will reduce Arizona\u2019s supply of Colorado River water, delivered by a system of canals and pumping stations called the Central Arizona Project, by about 20 percent, or 512,000 acre-feet. (An acre-foot is about 325,000 gallons, enough water for two or three households for a year.)",
      "In anticipation of the cuts, some farmers have fallowed fields or switched to less water-intensive crops. Others will be pumping more groundwater to make up for the cuts, which raises additional questions about sustainability because groundwater supplies are not unlimited.",
      "\u201cThe river is the iconic resource,\u201d said Kevin Moran of the Environmental Defense Fund. \u201cBut we have to think about managing our groundwater as well.\u201d",
      "The question for Lake Mead and the Colorado is whether the Tier 1 cuts will be enough to halt the decline in supply as climate change continues to affect the river\u2019s flow. Additional tiers, which could go into effect soon if the lake level continues to decline, as the forecast released Monday projects, would involve increasingly draconian cuts. And even further reductions may have to be negotiated.",
      "This year has been one of the worst ever for runoff into the Colorado River, said Ted Cooke, general manager of the Central Arizona Project. \u201cThe big question is, what\u2019s going to happen in 2022?\u201d he said. After two decades of drought, \u201cone thing that we don\u2019t have is the resiliency in the reservoirs, because they\u2019re so low, to withstand the type of year that we had this year back to back.\u201d",
      "Sharon B. Megdal, director of the Water Resources Research Center at the University of Arizona, said she thought the declaration\u2019s focus on the dire state of the river would lead to more efforts in the region to use less water. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to see some adaptation,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if we can do that much to avoid further cuts.\u201d",
      "With the various tier cuts that were negotiated, \u201cWe\u2019re really only talking through 2025,\u201d Dr. Megdal said. \u201cIf things continued to get worse and worse, I think there would be some interventions to do even more. We can\u2019t let the river system fail.\u201d",
      "Lake Mead now contains about 12 million acre-feet of water, far below its capacity of nearly 30 million acre-feet. The last time it was anywhere near full was two decades ago.",
      "Since then, much of the Southwest has been mired in a drought that climate scientists say rivals some long-lasting droughts in the past 2,000 years.",
      "Even in the occasional recent year with good snowpack in the Rocky Mountains, the amount of water running off into the river has declined. Researchers say warming is largely to blame, as soils have become so dry that they soak up much of the melting snow like a sponge, before it can reach the river.",
      "Planning for the likelihood of a reduced supply of Colorado River water began shortly after the drought first set in. By 2007, the states had developed guidelines for coping with shortages, which the 2019 agreement fleshed out.",
      "\u201cThe announcement today is a recognition that the hydrology that was planned for years ago and we hoped we\u2019d never see is here,\u201d said Camille Touton, a deputy commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation.",
      "\u201cThe river is in uncharted territory,\u201d Mr. Moran said. \u201cClimate scientists have pretty well articulated that something like 40 to 60 percent of the decline is due to a warming climate.\u201d",
      "Mr. Moran said that the new infrastructure bill, which has passed the Senate but faces a rockier road in the House, includes at least several billion dollars that could help the region cope with this new reality. This includes money to improve so-called natural infrastructure, including forests, watersheds and underground aquifers, which could help bolster the supply, or at least slow the decline.",
      "\u201cOur water infrastructure is not just man-made reservoirs and treatment plants,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the natural system, too.\u201d"

Before this summer\u2019s surge, the highest number of active cases was 295, reported nearly a year ago. Only 37 percent of the population was fully vaccinated as of Saturday, trailing every state but Mississippi and Alabama, according to federal data.",

      "Mr. Motta attributed the lagging vaccination rate to misinformation, a segment of the islands\u2019 population that is deeply suspicious of vaccines and the fact that the shots are not yet fully approved but are being administered under emergency use authorizations.",
      "The islands have set up a lottery to incentivize vaccinations, Mr. Motta said, and shots or regular testing are required for the roughly 6,000 government employees, the staff members at the territory\u2019s hospitals. Vaccines are mandatory for most on-campus students and staff at the University of the Virgin Islands, as well.",
      "The islands made vaccines available to all adults when much of the country still limited them to high-risk groups, leading some Americans to visit in order to be inoculated.",
      "All deaths and hospitalizations recorded in the islands involve unvaccinated people, Mr. Motta said, and the few documented breakthrough infections were not serious \u2014 more evidence that vaccines offer high protection from the worst outcomes.",

    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 With the Afghan government collapsing to a surging Taliban, President Biden sought to project an image of resolve on Saturday, speeding the deployment of an additional 1,000 troops to Afghanistan as he announced a series of steps that he said would protect American interests.",
      "The announcement came hours after the Taliban seized the last major city in northern Afghanistan, Mazar-i-Sharif, marking the complete loss of the country\u2019s north as they appeared on the verge of a full military takeover. A day earlier, two key cities in southern and western Afghanistan fell to the Taliban.",
      "On Sunday, the insurgents took Jalalabad, the capital of Nangarhar Province in the east. With that, they essentially encircled the capital, Kabul, which is now the only major city left under government control.",
      "Mr. Biden\u2019s statement on Saturday did little beyond asserting what the administration has already been doing: proclaiming support for the government of Afghanistan, warning the Taliban not to attack American troops and undertaking the intensive process of giving special immigrant visas to fleeing Afghans who worked for the United States over the past 20 years.",
      "The president defended his decision to leave the country after two decades of war, a departure that has led to the near-disintegration of the Afghan military.",
      "He also sought to spread the blame, accusing President Donald J. Trump of boxing him in by agreeing to a May 1 deadline to withdraw all American troops from the country.",
      "\u201cI faced a choice \u2014 follow through on the deal, with a brief extension to get our forces and our allies\u2019 forces out safely, or ramp up our presence and send more American troops to fight once again in another country\u2019s civil conflict,\u201d he said.",
      "He added: \u201cI was the fourth president to preside over an American troop presence in Afghanistan \u2014 two Republicans, two Democrats. I would not, and will not, pass this war onto a fifth.\u201d",
      "Mr. Trump himself has criticized Mr. Biden\u2019s decision to withdraw; in reality, both men promised to end America\u2019s longest war.",
      "Mr. Biden\u2019s top national security aides were huddled in meetings at the White House all day Saturday, as an unrelenting stream of bad news came in from Afghanistan. The president, in his statement, directed his secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, to support President Ashraf Ghani and other Afghan leaders as \u201cthey seek to prevent further bloodshed and pursue a political settlement.\u201d As part of the effort, Mr. Blinken will also contact top officials in the region, the White House said.",
      "An administration official said that the administration would also reach out to the Taliban in the next day. It was unclear whether the outreach would go further than the warning Mr. Biden reiterated on Saturday, \u201cthat any action on their part on the ground in Afghanistan that puts U.S. personnel or our mission at risk there will be met with a swift and strong U.S. military response.\u201d",
      "Mr. Biden\u2019s decision on Saturday to accelerate the deployment of an additional 1,000 troops to Afghanistan brings the number of American troops on the ground to 5,000. The Pentagon had announced this week that 3,000 forces would join the 1,000 already in the country as part of the effort to evacuate Americans and their allies. In addition, the Pentagon said on Friday that it would send an additional 3,000 from the Army\u2019s 82nd Airborne to Kuwait as a sort of insurance policy, so they could be in the region if needed; the additional troops Mr. Biden ordered to Afghanistan on Saturday were among those bound for Kuwait.",
      "A senior U.S. official said Zalmay Khalilzad, the chief American negotiator with the Taliban in peace talks in Doha, Qatar, has asked the extremist group to not enter Kabul until the United States concludes evacuating what could be more than 10,000 American citizens, including Afghan-Americans, embassy staff and translators and other Afghans who have worked with the American government. It was unclear how quickly the evacuations could be completed or if that was even possible.",
      "Taliban officials have countered by asking that the United States cease airstrikes against its fighters as they take over cities across Afghanistan.",
      "As his army has all but collapsed and his government\u2019s control shrinks, Mr. Ghani is facing pressure to step down. Yet in a recorded speech televised early Saturday afternoon, he promised only to \u201cprevent further instability\u201d and did not resign. With Taliban forces having captured Pul-i-Alam, a provincial capital only 40 miles from Kabul, Mr. Ghani said he had begun \u201cextensive consultations at home and abroad\u201d and that the results would soon be shared. He said remobilizing Afghanistan\u2019s military forces was a priority.",
      "Still, he has little apparent support at home, and thousands of his soldiers were surrendering. Mr. Ghani was not \u201cworth fighting for,\u201d Omar Zakhilwal, a former finance minister, tweeted on Friday.",
      "With most of Afghanistan under the control of the Taliban, and with Kabul one of the last bastions held by government forces, many of the city\u2019s residents expressed fatalism and fear at the prospect of their home falling into the hands of the militant group.",
      "The loss of the country\u2019s north \u2014 once the heart of the resistance to the Taliban\u2019s earlier rise to power in 1996 \u2014 offered a devastating blow to morale for a country gripped with panic.",
      "The Taliban seized Mazar-i-Sharif barely an hour after breaking through the front lines at the city\u2019s edge. Soon after, government security forces and militias fled \u2014 including those led by the infamous warlords Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum and Atta Muhammad Noor \u2014 effectively handing control to the insurgents.",
      "In the late 1990s, Mazar-i-Sharif was the site of pitched battles between the Taliban and northern militia groups that managed to push back the hard-line insurgents before the group took over the city in 1998. The victory followed infighting and defections among the militias and culminated with the Taliban\u2019s massacre of hundreds of militia fighters who had surrendered.",
      "During the current Taliban military campaign, Mazar\u2019s defense was almost completely reliant on the reincarnations of some of those very same militias that have all but failed to hold their territory elsewhere in the north. Some are led by Mr. Dostum, a former Afghan vice president who has survived the past 40 years of war by cutting deals and switching sides.",
      "Others were behind Mr. Noor, a longtime power broker and warlord in Balkh Province who fought the Soviets in the 1980s and the Taliban in the 1990s. During the civil war, he was a commander in Jamiat-i-Islami, an Islamist party in the country\u2019s north, and he was a leading figure in the Northern Alliance that supported the American invasion in 2001. Shortly afterward, he became Balkh\u2019s governor, deeply entrenched as the singular authority in the province. He refused to leave his position after Mr. Ghani fired him in 2017."

Fighter jets and helicopter gunships would have responded in force, beating back the Islamist group or, at the very least, stalling its advance.",
      "But these are different times. What aircraft the U.S. military could muster from hundreds of miles away struck a cache of weapons far from Kunduz, Taliqan or Sar-i-Pul, the cities that already had been all but lost to the Taliban.",
      "The muted American response on Sunday showed in no uncertain terms that America\u2019s 20-year war in Afghanistan is over. The mismanaged and exhausted Afghan forces will have to retake the cities on their own, or leave them to the Taliban for good.",
      "The recent string of Taliban military victories has not moved President Biden to reassess his decision to end the U.S. combat mission by the end of the month, senior administration officials said Sunday. But the violence shows just how difficult it will be for Mr. Biden to extract America from the war while insisting that he is not abandoning the country in the middle of a brutal Taliban offensive.",
      "In a speech defending the U.S. withdrawal last month, Mr. Biden said the United States had done more than enough to empower the Afghan police and military to secure the future of their people. U.S. officials have acknowledged that those forces will struggle, but argue they must now fend for themselves.",
      "So far, the administration\u2019s sink-or-swim strategy has not shown promising results.",
      "Over the past week, Taliban fighters have moved swiftly to retake cities around Afghanistan, assassinated government officials, and killed civilians in the process. Throughout this, American officials have publicly held out hope that Afghan forces have the resources and ability to fight back, while at the same time negotiating a peace deal with the Taliban that seems more unlikely by the day.",
      "Leon E. Panetta, who served as defense secretary under President Barack Obama, said he had expected to see more U.S. air support on Sunday, but he did not expect the situation would improve markedly even with the help of American forces.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s face it,\u201d Mr. Panetta said. \u201cThe most you can hope for now is some kind of stalemate\u201d between Afghan forces and Taliban fighters, who have demonstrated little interest in reaching an accord since the American troop withdrawal was announced.",
      "At the Pentagon, where senior leaders have reluctantly cut off most military support to Afghanistan, officials were on phone calls Sunday about the unfolding events around Kunduz, a city of more than 350,000 people. The United States has twice in the past intervened to retake Kunduz from the Taliban.",
      "But defense officials said there were no plans to take action this time beyond limited airstrikes. Over the past three weeks, the United States has used armed Reaper drones and AC-130 aerial gunships to target Taliban equipment, including heavy artillery, that threaten population centers, foreign embassies and Afghan government buildings, officials said.",
      "One official acknowledged that with only 650 American troops remaining on the ground in Afghanistan, a concerted air campaign was unlikely to undo the advances the Taliban had made.",
      "Although the American military mission will formally conclude at the end of this month, American troops and their Western allies are mostly gone already. The U.S. handed over Bagram Air Base \u2014 once the military\u2019s nerve center \u2014 to the Afghans last month, effectively ending major U.S. military operations.",
      "Now, air support for the Afghan forces and overhead surveillance arrives from outside the country, from bases in Qatar or the United Arab Emirates, or from an aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea.",
      "Wesley Clark, the former top NATO general under President Bill Clinton, called the weekend\u2019s events \u201ca tragedy for the people of Afghanistan, and a consequence of American misjudgments and failures.\u201d",
      "Civilian casualties have skyrocketed. Nearly 2,400 civilians have been killed or injured between May 1 and June 30, according to a United Nations report released last month, the highest number recorded for that period since monitoring began in 2009.",
      "When asked about the Taliban\u2019s advances on Friday, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, told reporters that Mr. Biden had long been prepared to make \u201cdifficult choices\u201d as part of his commitment to disengaging from Afghanistan.",
      "\u201cThe president made clear: After 20 years at war, it\u2019s time for American troops to come home,\u201d Ms. Psaki said. \u201cHe also feels and has stated that the Afghan government and the Afghan National Defense Forces have the training, equipment and numbers to prevail, and now is the moment for the leadership and the will in the face of the Taliban\u2019s aggression and violence.\u201d",
      "Ms. Psaki\u2019s comments echoed a prevailing view among the progressive national security wing of Mr. Biden\u2019s party that Afghan troops would fight back if given no other option.",
      "\u201cLike in Iraq, at a certain point the training wheels have to come off,\u201d said Jon Soltz, an Iraq war veteran and the chairman of the progressive veterans group VoteVets. \u201cThat\u2019s when the Iraqi Army stepped up, and it will be when the Afghan Army does.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey may have their backs against the wall as things move closer to Kabul, but that\u2019s precisely when they\u2019ll fight the hardest and hold the line,\u201d said Mr. Soltz, who helped to train the Iraqi army. \u201cWe have done all we can to prepare them for this moment.\u201d",
      "So far, no senior Pentagon official has expressed exasperation publicly with Mr. Biden over the Taliban surge, which Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III predicted this past spring, when he and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, both counseled Mr. Biden against the complete withdrawal of American troops.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this movie before,\u201d Mr. Austin told his boss, in a reference to the Obama-era withdrawal from Iraq, which was followed by the rise of the Islamic State. The United States ended up returning to Iraq and launching five years of airstrikes in Iraq and Syria to help Iraqi security forces beat back that insurgent group.",
      "Mr. Biden has argued for pulling out of Afghanistan for years. In 2009, while serving as vice president, he argued for a minimal force, only to be overruled as Mr. Obama ordered a surge of forces, then a rapid drawdown.",
      "But a dozen years later, as president, he made the decision to withdraw, one of the most significant decisions of his presidency so far. And despite the likelihood that the White House will confront terrible images of human suffering and loss in the coming weeks and months, Mr. Biden has vowed to press ahead regardless of the conditions on the ground.",
      "Polls show that large numbers of Americans in both parties support leaving Afghanistan.",
      "Mr. Biden, declaring that the United States had long ago accomplished its mission of denying terrorists a haven in Afghanistan, said in April that all American troops would leave the country by Sept. 11. That date has since been moved up to Aug. 31, giving the Pentagon \u2014 and Afghan forces \u2014 just over a month to slow the Taliban surge.",
      "Administration and military officials have voiced conflicting views on whether the United States will continue airstrikes after Aug. 31 to prevent Afghan cities and the Afghan government, led by President Ashraf Ghani, from falling. But even if the airstrikes continue, they can only do so much; the bulk of the effort will have to come from Afghan forces on the ground.",
      "In any event, Kunduz was never going to be the Afghan city that might prompt Mr. Biden to rethink his strategy, two U.S. officials said on Sunday on condition of anonymity.",
      "His hand might be forced if Taliban forces are on the verge of overrunning Kandahar, Afghanistan\u2019s second-largest city, or even Kabul, where the United States maintains an embassy with some 4,000 people."

      "During a phone call with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger of Georgia on Jan. 2, two days before Mr. Pak resigned, Mr. Trump asked Mr. Raffensperger to find enough votes to reverse the state\u2019s presidential election results and described fraud allegations that Mr. Raffensperger said were not supported by facts, according to leaked audio of the call.",
      "Mr. Pak had refused to support similar election fraud claims because of the lack of evidence, according to two people familiar with his investigation. \u201cYou have your never-Trumper U.S. attorney there,\u201d Mr. Trump told Mr. Raffensperger during their phone call.",
      "Audio of that call was leaked to The Washington Post on Sunday, Jan. 3, just hours before Mr. Trump met with top Justice Department officials to discuss the possibility of replacing the acting attorney general, Jeffrey A. Rosen, with Jeffrey Clark, a department leader who was willing to falsely tell Georgia officials that fraud might have affected the election outcome.",
      "While Mr. Rosen and Mr. Clark argued at the meeting about which man should lead the Justice Department and whether the department should intervene in Georgia, Mr. Trump interjected with complaints about the department\u2019s official conclusion that the state election results were valid, according to three people briefed on the meeting. Mr. Trump ultimately decided not to elevate Mr. Clark, and the department did not send Georgia officials a letter seeking to undermine Mr. Biden\u2019s win.",
      "Immediately after the Sunday evening meeting in the Oval Office, the Justice Department\u2019s No. 2 official, Richard P. Donoghue, sent an email to Mr. Pak at 10:09 p.m. that said, \u201cPlease call ASAP,\u201d according to documents that the House Oversight and Reform Committee obtained from the Justice Department and released in June.",
      "During that phone call, Mr. Donoghue relayed that Mr. Trump remained fixated on the false notion that he had won Georgia, and said the president was angry that Mr. Pak did not support that conclusion, according to a person familiar with the call.",
      "Early the next morning, Mr. Pak sent Mr. Donoghue resignation letters addressed to Mr. Trump and Mr. Rosen, effective immediately.",
      "Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut and a member of the Judiciary Committee, said on Wednesday that Mr. Pak had \u201canswered all questions in a seemingly honest and candid way, and my impression is that he believes in the rule of law and that he stood up for it.\u201d",
      "Mr. Blumenthal and Senator Jon Ossoff, Democrat of Georgia, were among a handful of committee members who listened to all of Mr. Pak\u2019s testimony.",
      "While the panel\u2019s investigation is ongoing, it has completed its first set of interviews. They included Mr. Pak, Mr. Donoghue and Mr. Rosen, who spoke with the committee for nearly seven hours and with the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general for about two hours.",
      "Mr. Clark has not said whether he will come in for an interview, and the committee has not indicated who else it wants to speak with. The Justice Department has said that it will not invoke executive privilege if former officials are asked to testify before congressional investigators."

    "title": "Census Shows Sharply Growing Numbers of Hispanic, Asian and Multiracial Americans",
    "content": [
      "The United States grew significantly more diverse over the past decade, as the populations of people who identify as Hispanic and Asian surged and the number of people who said they were more than one race more than doubled, the Census Bureau reported on Thursday.",
      "Overall population growth slowed substantially over the past decade, but the growth that did occur \u2014 an increase of about 23 million people \u2014 was made up entirely of people who identified as Hispanic, Asian, Black and more than one race, according to the data, the first racial and ethnic breakdown from the 2020 census.",
      "The white population declined for the first time in history. People who identify themselves as white on the census form have been decreasing as a share of the country\u2019s population since the 1960s, when the United States lifted strict ethnic quotas aimed at keeping the country Northern and Western European.",
      "That drop, of 2.6 percent, was driven in part by the aging of the white population \u2014 the median age was 44 in 2019, compared with 30 for Hispanics \u2014 and a long-running decline in the birthrate. Some social scientists theorized that another potential reason for the decrease was that more Americans who previously identified as white on the census are now choosing more than one race.",
      "The single biggest population increase was among people who identified as more than one race, a category that first appeared on census forms 20 years ago, and now is the fastest-growing racial and ethnic category.",
      "People who identify as white now make up 58 percent of the population, down from 64 percent in 2010, and 69 percent in 2000.",
      "\u201cWe are in a weird time demographically,\u201d said Tom\u00e1s Jim\u00e9nez, a sociologist at Stanford University who writes about immigrants, assimilation and social mobility. \u201cThere\u2019s more choice about our individual identities and how we present them than there has ever been. We can presume far less about who somebody is based on the boxes they check compared to previous periods.\u201d",
      "The data also showed that just under a majority of people under the age of 18 checked boxes other than white \u2014 multirace, Hispanic, Asian, or Black \u2014 a milestone that is the result of a substantially more diverse younger American population. A decade ago, 65 percent of children were white. Overall, the number of Americans under the age of 18 declined, partly an effect of the drop in the birthrate, according to William Frey, chief demographer at the Brookings Institution.",
      "Thursday\u2019s numbers provide this census\u2019 first picture of changes in the American population below the level of states.",
      "The five largest cities in the country are now New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston and Phoenix. Philadelphia is now the sixth largest city, bumped from fifth by Phoenix, which was the fastest growing of the top 10 largest cities. Its population rose by 11.2 percent.",
      "The Villages, a retirement community in Florida, was the fastest-growing metropolitan area in the country over the decade.",
      "The data, charting which parts of the country have seen growth and decline, have a practical use in politics. They are the basis for redistricting, a process in which state legislatures redraw voting lines based on changes in their states\u2019 populations.",
      "The new data show that Hispanics accounted for about half the country\u2019s growth over the past decade, up by about 23 percent. The Asian population grew faster than expected \u2014 up by about 36 percent, a rise that made up nearly a fifth of the country\u2019s total. Nearly one in four Americans now identifies as either Hispanic or Asian. The Black population grew by 6 percent, an increase that represented about a tenth of the country\u2019s growth. Americans who identified as non-Hispanic and more than one race rose the fastest, jumping to 13.5 million from 6 million.",
      "And in what appears to be a big shift in how Hispanics think of their racial identity, one third of Hispanics reported being more than one race, up from just 6 percent in 2010. That means that Hispanics are now nearly twice as likely to identify as multiracial than as white.",
      "Hispanic origin is counted as an ethnicity, and is a distinct category from race. But Hispanics can also check race boxes.",
      "Richard Alba, a sociologist who has studied demographics and the fluidity of racial categories, said the rise in multiracial Americans was a logical extension of the substantial mixing that has been happening for years in the United States.",
      "Among Asians and Hispanics, more than a quarter marry outside their race, according to the Pew Research Center. For American-born Asians, the share is nearly double that.",
      "The jump in the multirace category is partly to do with the Census Bureau collecting more detailed data, Professor Alba said, and analyzing answers more deeply. He said he believed that part of the decrease in the white population was people switching from the category of white to the category of more than one race.",
      "\u201cThe census is doing a much better job at reflecting the growing complexity of the population,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are really trying to acknowledge that the world is changing out there.\u201d",
      "The nation has been growing more diverse for decades, but recently the pace has accelerated. Non-Hispanic white people accounted for 46 percent of population growth in the 1970s, 36 percent in the 1980s, 20 percent in the 1990s, but just 8 percent of the growth in the first decade of this century and now zero in the 2010s.",
      "Immigration is a force that has bolstered the American population, and boosted the economy, bringing a younger work force that is helping support a growing older population.",
      "Despite the dramatic slowdown in immigration at the end of the decade, the proportion of U.S. residents born in foreign countries is still at its highest point since the last big immigration wave around the turn of the 20th century.",
      "Immigrants who have arrived in more recent years have largely been from countries in Asia and Latin America and have tended to settle in large cities, like New York and Los Angeles.",
      "But over time, Hispanic and Asian immigrants and their children have fanned out broadly across the country, to smaller towns and rural areas.",
      "That migration has helped support the numbers of people in rural places: Over the past decade, rural places lost both Black and white residents \u2014 their populations in those places each dropped by about five percent \u2014 but the numbers of people who identify as Hispanic and Asian continued to rise. In 2000, Hispanic and Asian residents made up just 6 percent of the rural population. Now it\u2019s nearly 10 percent.",
      "But that increase was not enough to stem the tide out of rural places, which ultimately lost population over the decade, a change from the previous decade, when rural places made modest gains.",
      "The biggest winners in population growth were suburbs and retirement communities in the South and the West. In counties considered to be retirement destinations, the population jumped by 17 percent.",
      "Industrial cities in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions saw the biggest population losses, places such as Saginaw, Flint and Detroit in Michigan; Gary, Ind.; and Youngstown, Ohio.",
      "The counties that have changed the most demographically over the past decade tended to be places that started out overwhelmingly white. Counties like Luzerne in Pennsylvania and Forsythe in Georgia are among the biggest gainers of diversity since 2010. Also high on the list are two counties in North Dakota, Cass and Ward, and Livingston Parish in Louisiana.",
      "Now, about 98 percent of Americans live in a county with an increasing number of Latinos, and 95 percent live in a county where the Asian population is on the rise. Diversity is rising in 19 out of every 20 counties.",
      "Still, growth slowed dramatically, even for Hispanics and Asians, driven in part by declining birthrates, as well as a drop in immigration. For example, the population of Asian people grew at just half the rate of the previous decade, when it rose by about 43 percent. Growth in the Hispanic population had an even steeper decline.",
      "Growth in the Black population slowed too, but was still broad. All but nine states gained Black residents and the Black share of the population went up in 32 states. While half the nation\u2019s population growth occurred in the South, 70 percent of Black population growth occurred in those states. The vast majority of the Black population growth was suburban. It increased by 6 percent overall but 12 percent in suburban neighborhoods.",
      "And in a new twist likely to draw demographers\u2019 attention, the Black population fell in Black-majority neighborhoods but rose in neighborhoods where Black people made up less than 10 percent of the population.",
      "The white population may have declined nationally, but it grew in certain parts of the country. As in previous decades, the vast majority of white population growth occurred in neighborhoods that were mostly white to begin with \u2014 largely exurbs at the outer edges of metro areas.",
      "Nearly three dozen states lost white population and all but the District of Columbia, which is treated as a state for statistical purposes, saw the share of white residents drop.",
      "Race may be socially constructed but the understanding of it has important political effects. One change that has been politically resonant has been the shrinking share of the white population, with the right seeing the shift as a threat and the left celebrating it as a kind of demographic destiny in which growing numbers of people of color will vote for Democrats.",
      "Professor Jim\u00e9nez, whose county, Santa Clara, in California, became minority white more than 20 years ago, said these two views are most common among highly politicized Americans, and that most people don\u2019t notice diversity.",
      "\u201cYou go to places that have been majority-minority for a long time and the diversity is banal \u2014 it\u2019s not like everyone has bumper stickers saying celebrate diversity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something they celebrate or panic over. It\u2019s mostly just a fact of life.\u201d"

    "title": "Top Biden aides are briefed on the mysterious illnesses plaguing U.S. diplomats and spies.",
    "content": [
      "President Biden\u2019s top aides were told on Friday that experts studying the mysterious illnesses affecting scores of diplomats, spies and their family members were still struggling to find evidence to back up the leading theory, that microwave attacks are being launched by Russian agents.",
      "The report came in an unusual, classified meeting called by the director of national intelligence, Avril D. Haines, according to several senior administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The purpose of the meeting was to assess the investigations and efforts to treat victims of the so-called Havana syndrome \u2014 the unexplained headaches, dizziness and memory loss reported by scores of State Department officials, C.I.A. officers and their families.",
      "While Mr. Biden has said almost nothing publicly about the episodes, the National Security Council has begun an urgent effort to address the issue, and two separate task forces are now in operation, one investigating the cause and led by the C.I.A. and another focused on finding commercial technology that could detect or block attacks.",
      "The subject of the Friday meeting of the Joint Intelligence Community Council was confirmed on Sunday evening by Timothy Barrett, the assistant director of national intelligence for strategic communications.",
      "\u201cThis is a top priority for the intelligence community,\u201d he said, \u201cand we are supporting the N.S.C.-led effort to get answers, take care of our people and prevent future incidents.\u201d",
      "The meeting included Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken; Attorney General Merrick B. Garland; the C.I.A. director, William J. Burns; and the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray.",
      "The high-ranking nature of the session was an indication of how quickly the attacks, which date to 2016, have risen from a medical mystery to an urgent national security issue. Biden administration officials say they were shocked at how disorganized the government response was over the past four years, in part because there was no central way for departments to share reports of the episodes and because many of the targets were intelligence officers whose identities and locations could not be revealed.",
      "A December 2020 study of the causes by the National Academy of Sciences concluded that microwave attacks were most likely the cause, but Biden administration officials say the group had no access to classified information."

    "title": "U.S. Signals It Will Release Some Still-Secret Files on Saudi Arabia and 9/11",
    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Biden administration, under pressure from families of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks, said on Monday that it intended to disclose some long-classified documents that the families think could detail connections between the government of Saudi Arabia and the hijackers who carried out the attacks.",
      "In a court filing in long-running litigation brought by the victims\u2019 families against Saudi Arabia, the Justice Department said that the F.B.I. \u201crecently\u201d closed a portion of its investigation into the terrorist attacks and was beginning a review of documents that it had previously said must remain secret with an eye toward disclosing more of them.",
      "\u201cThe F.B.I. has decided to review its prior privilege assertions to identify additional information appropriate for disclosure,\u201d the department said in a letter to two federal judges in Manhattan overseeing the case. \u201cThe F.B.I. will disclose such information on a rolling basis as expeditiously as possible.\u201d",
      "The terse letter provided no further details about what additional information might become public, or when disclosures would begin.",
      "The decision came after a group representing more than 1,600 people directly affected by the attacks called last week for President Biden to not participate in any memorial events for the 20th anniversary of the attacks next month unless he fulfilled a campaign promise to review the documents for possible declassification and release.",
      "After the filing, the White House issued a statement from Mr. Biden expressing sympathy for the family members and invoking a 2009 policy, issued when he was vice president, that imposed limits on when the government may assert the state secrets privilege to block the disclosure of evidence in lawsuits for national security reasons.",
      "\u201cAs I promised during my campaign, my administration is committed to ensuring the maximum degree of transparency under the law, and to adhering to the rigorous guidance issued during the Obama-Biden administration on the invocation of the state secrets privilege,\u201d Mr. Biden said.",
      "He added, \u201cIn this vein, I welcome the Department of Justice\u2019s filing today, which commits to conducting a fresh review of documents where the government has previously asserted privileges, and to doing so as quickly as possible.\u201d",
      "In a letter sent to a representative of the families before the presidential election last fall, Mr. Biden had said he would direct his attorney general to \u201cexamine the merits of all cases where the invocation of privilege is recommended, and to err on the side of disclosure in cases where, as here, the events in question occurred two decades or longer ago.\u201d",
      "Mr. Biden had referred to a Trump-era decision that kept the documents classified on the grounds that they contained state secrets, and said his own administration would \u201cwork constructively on such cases.\u201d",
      "Nearly 3,000 people died in the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. The organizers of the statement last week calling for Mr. Biden to release the documents said they were unsure how many victims were represented by its more than 1,600 signatures. Each name belongs to either a close relative of someone whose death was caused by the attacks, a person who became severely sick as a result of them or a survivor, they said.",
      "The Biden administration\u2019s decision to review the classified documents was the latest development in a nearly two-decade odyssey for some of the families. They have pushed four American presidents, with little success, to release more information about Saudi involvement in financing the attacks.",
      "The 9/11 Commission found \u201cno evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded\u201d Al Qaeda, which carried out the attacks. But the commission\u2019s phrasing left some to speculate that there might be evidence of involvement by other, lower-ranking officials.",
      "An investigation last year by The New York Times Magazine and ProPublica found that F.B.I. agents, who secretly investigated Saudi connections to the Sept. 11 attacks for more than a decade, had discovered circumstantial evidence of such support but no smoking gun.",
      "The families were stunned in 2019 when William P. Barr, who was the attorney general under President Donald J. Trump at the time, declared in a statement to a federal court that documents relating to the attacks should stay classified to protect national security.",
      "On Friday, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said that White House officials had met in recent weeks with groups representing families of victims, and that the document requests would \u201ccontinue to be a priority\u201d for Mr. Biden.",
      "In the statement last week, the families group said that it could not \u201cin good faith, and with veneration to those lost, sick and injured,\u201d welcome Mr. Biden to the commemorations next month if he did not follow through on his campaign promise.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s 20 years; this has gone on for too long,\u201d Brett Eagleson, who was a 15-year-old sophomore in high school when his father, Bruce, died at the World Trade Center, said in an interview last week. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to release the documents and you\u2019re going to continue with the process of covering up the Saudi role in 9/11, we\u2019ll have to object to you coming.\u201d",
      "Mr. Eagleson, who is now 35 and works in banking, said that seeing the documents might offer him and other victims\u2019 relatives some long-overdue closure.",
      "He said on Monday that the F.B.I.\u2019s review was a step in the right direction, but that it was not sufficient to assuage families\u2019 anxieties about the documents.",
      "\u201cIt sounds like it\u2019s promising, but let\u2019s see what they actually produce,\u201d he said.",
      "Another group of victims\u2019 families and survivors, 9/11 Community United, criticized the Biden administration\u2019s move, calling it a \u201chalfhearted, insufficient commitment to transparency\u201d in a statement and saying that it applied only to limited documents.",
      "\u201cThis announcement is a necessary but insufficient step towards transparency, accountability and above all, justice,\u201d a member of the group, Terry Strada, whose husband died in the attacks, said in a statement.",
      "Mr. Eagleson is among the thousands of victims\u2019 relatives who accused Saudi Arabia in a 2017 lawsuit of complicity in the attacks. They had successfully fought for years for the right to sue, gaining it in 2016 when Congress overrode a veto by President Barack Obama to pass into law a bill allowing such a lawsuit.",
      "The suit has languished in the courts as lawyers for the kingdom fought it. On Friday, James P. Kreindler, one of the lawyers representing the families, said that 20 Saudi officials were recently questioned under oath, and added that a judge would decide next year whether the case advances."

      "Dr. Bright\u2019s removal last April as head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Agency created upheaval within the Department of Health and Human Services in the earliest days of the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "He said he was removed from his post after he pressed for rigorous vetting of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug embraced by President Donald J. Trump as a coronavirus treatment, and that the administration had put \u201cpolitics and cronyism ahead of science.\u201d",
      "Those allegations are still being investigated by the Office of Special Counsel, which protects federal whistle-blowers. Under Mr. Trump, H.H.S. officials denied any wrongdoing.",
      "The Biden administration confirmed the settlement of the case on Monday in a statement praising Dr. Bright, who advised President Biden during his transition.",
      "\u201cThe agency would like to thank Dr. Bright for his dedicated public service and for the contributions he made to addressing the Covid-19 pandemic while he served as BARDA director,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe wish him well in his new endeavors.\u201d",
      "Neither side disclosed details or specifics of the settlement. But Dr. Bright\u2019s lawyer, Debra S. Katz, said her client had been compensated to the fullest extent allowed by the law. She said he will receive back pay, as well as damages to cover the costs of private security and temporary housing that he required after receiving threats. He will also receive compensation, Ms. Katz said, for distress \u201cassociated with the disparaging comments and threats\u201d made by administration officials including Mr. Trump, who had blasted Dr. Bright on Twitter as a \u201ccreep\u201d and a \u201cdisgruntled employee.\u201d",
      "Dr. Bright now works for the Rockefeller Foundation, where he is developing a new institute devoted to pandemic prevention that will function as a hub for scientists in government, the private sector and academia. The goal is to identify new pathogens, he said in an interview. He said he was glad to have the episode behind him.",
      "\u201cGoing through the assault that I experienced from the last administration, going through the public criticism from the White House and H.H.S. leadership when I was just trying to do my job, put a lot of stress on me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were trying to find anything they could to disparage me and discredit me.\u201d",
      "After clashing with his bosses, Dr. Bright was assigned to a narrower role at the National Institutes of Health to work on a \u201cShark Tank\u201d-style program to develop coronavirus treatments. He later went on sick leave because of hypertension, a spokeswoman said at the time. In the interview Monday, Dr. Bright said that at the height of the controversy, he also received a diagnosis of skin cancer.",
      "Ultimately, he quit the government \u2014 a departure that Ms. Katz characterized as effectively a termination, because, she said, he had not been given any meaningful work.",
      "Ms. Katz said the settlement was especially satisfying to her. \u201cMany times, whistle-blowers come forward and that\u2019s the end of their career,\u201d she said.

      "After the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the United States and its allies needed less than four years to vanquish their fascist enemies. After the secession of Southern states in 1860 and 1861, the U.S. spent slightly more than four years defeating the rebellion. After the first battles at Lexington and Concord in 1775, the colonies took about eight years to beat the British and create a new nation.",
      "The war in Afghanistan \u2014 which ended yesterday, as the final U.S. troops left \u2014 lasted 19 years and 47 weeks, dating to the first bombing of the Taliban on Oct. 7, 2001. It is America\u2019s longest war, far longer than the country\u2019s great victories and longer even than its previous protracted defeat in Vietnam or stalemate in Korea.",
      "Over the past two decades, the U.S. has been able to claim some accomplishments. American troops killed Osama bin Laden (albeit in Pakistan, not Afghanistan) and captured or killed other architects of the 9/11 attacks. Afghanistan temporarily turned into a democracy where schools improved and women could live more freely than before.",
      "Yet the main accomplishments proved fleeting.",
      "For all of the bravery and sacrifice of the Afghan and American troops who fought together, their leaders failed to create an enduring government or functioning military. Despite two decades of work and a couple of trillion dollars spent, the U.S.-backed Afghan government collapsed in a matter of days. The regime was evidently no more enduring than it had been five years ago, 10 years ago \u2014 or on Dec. 22, 2001, when Hamid Karzai was sworn in as Afghanistan\u2019s first post-9/11 leader.",
      "Across the span of American history, it\u2019s hard to think of another failed project that lasted so long or cost so much. There have been worse injustices and tragedies in this country, but they were usually deliberate. The U.S. has been attempting to win in Afghanistan for nearly the entire 21st century.",
      "Biden certainly could have overseen a more successful exit than he did, especially if he and his aides had taken more seriously the chances of a rapid Taliban takeover. I also understand that some people believe that an unending, low-level war in Afghanistan was worth the trade-offs. These advocates argue that the number of American soldiers killed each year had fallen into the single digits, while the financial cost was below $20 billion a year (which, by comparison, is a little more than half the country\u2019s foreign-aid budget). In exchange, the U.S. likely could have prevented a complete Taliban takeover and the chaos of the past few weeks.",
      "But it\u2019s worth emphasizing that this option really did mean unending war. After nearly 20 years and no apparent progress toward an Afghan government that could stand on its own, America\u2019s longest war would have continued. It would not have resembled the ongoing U.S. presence in Korea, Japan and Western Europe, where no enemies are launching regular attacks and no American troops are being killed.",
      "It would have involved continued fighting, which has been killing more than 10,000 Afghan troops and more than 1,000 civilians every year. On Sunday, an errant U.S. drone missile may have killed 10 more civilians, including seven children.

    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Consumed with trying to help dozens of Afghans escape their country as U.S. troops prepared to withdraw, aides to Representative Michael Waltz, Republican of Florida, shifted their work schedules, coming in after midnight so they could talk evacuees through Taliban checkpoints.",
      "Representative Elissa Slotkin, Democrat of Michigan, and her staff began what she called \u201ca tense, 10-day odyssey\u201d involving two nations\u2019 militaries and several nongovernmental organizations to help evacuate 114 Afghans from Kabul.",
      "A contact of Senator Jon Ossoff, Democrat of Georgia, called a former military officer working for a private company as part of a frantic effort to try to extract two orphans encountering difficulties when they arrived at Hamid Karzai International Airport for their flight out of Kabul.",
      "Flooded with thousands of urgent requests from Americans and Afghans in the weeks since Kabul fell to the Taliban, dozens of members of Congress have become deeply involved in helping to arrange evacuations.",
      "According to interviews with a dozen lawmakers and aides who participated, they have spent sleepless nights fielding panicked calls, navigated what they described as infuriating bureaucratic hurdles and braced for the agony of informing families that there was little chance that they would be rescued.",
      "The stories, from both Democrats and Republicans, help explain the intensity of the bipartisan anger at the Biden administration for the way in which it planned for evacuations and its insistence on holding to the president\u2019s Aug. 31 withdrawal date.",
      "More than 123,000 people, most of them Afghans, have been evacuated since the Taliban seized Kabul on Aug. 15, administration officials said. But thousands more will be left behind. The last U.S. military plane left Afghanistan on Monday, formally bringing an end to America\u2019s longest war.",
      "Members of Congress were so aggressive in trying to secure the rescue of stranded Afghans that they \u201coverwhelmed\u201d the American task force in Kabul orchestrating high-priority evacuations, said Representative Seth Moulton, Democrat of Massachusetts, who traveled to Afghanistan on a secret trip last week.",
      "But in many cases, lawmakers gave up on the administration-led operation weeks ago, turning instead to their own connections to foreign officials, private organizations and individuals navigating private charter flights in and out of Afghanistan.",
      "Concerned donors have given millions to an effort, called Operation Flyaway and led by the firm Raven Advisory, to assist with evacuations, compiling a list of more than 4,000 Afghans whom Americans were seeking to help. Veterans\u2019 groups have sprung into action in volunteer efforts to organize what many call a digital Dunkirk. Some have taken it upon themselves to try to rescue Afghans they know personally from their time overseas.",
      "Together with congressional offices, an informal support network has arisen to fill the gaps.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s inspiring,\u201d said Mr. Waltz, a former Green Beret who served in Afghanistan. \u201cBut at the same time, I think it\u2019s a real testament to how badly the administration has dropped the ball.\u201d",
      "The frustration is bipartisan. When Representative Andy Kim, Democrat of New Jersey, sat down with a top State Department official over the weekend, he hoped it could provide the American family he was working to evacuate from Afghanistan with a lifeline.",
      "Mr. Kim entered the meeting with a simple request: What was the best phone number the family could call for help?",
      "\u201cI was told no such number exists,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.",
      "In an interview, Mr. Kim, who served in Afghanistan as an Army strategic adviser, said his office had received more than 6,000 requests for help, many of them spearheaded by veterans or national security officers trying to assist their former colleagues in Afghanistan. The requests came in, he said, through \u201ctexts, WhatsApp, Signal, email, phone calls \u2014 just literally around the clock.\u201d",
      "\u201cI tell them that I can make no promises here, but they feel what I feel, which is we have to try and not just sit on our hands,\u201d Mr. Kim said.",
      "Despite their best efforts, though, congressional staff members have often found their hands tied. One aide described the anguish of having to tell multiple Afghans that while they were eligible to leave the country, their children were not. The hardest part, another aide said, were the phone calls in which constituents broke down on the line, worried about their trapped families. Others said they had spent recent days crying at their desks out of frustration and anger.",
      "\u201cOne friend of mine said, \u2018Look, my Afghan ally and his family, including a 2-year-old, made it into the airport, and then were escorted out,\u2019\u201d said Representative Veronica Escobar, Democrat of Texas. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find out why. But the incredible desperation and heartbreak is overwhelming.\u201d",
      "Even the success stories are tinged with pain. In the early days of evacuation, Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, was able to help Sultan Mansoor, an Afghan translator who lived in his district and had become stranded in Kabul on a trip to visit family. Mr. Sultan and his extended family had received instructions to arrive at the airport, only to be turned away by U.S. soldiers.",
      "\u201cWe were scheduled to get in the air, but somehow we couldn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Sultan said in an interview. \u201cIt was very difficult for them, I think, but they picked people randomly.\u201d",
      "The next day, Mr. Sultan and his family got through the airport gates \u2014 but not before the Taliban beat him, his father and his brother.",
      "Ms. Slotkin, a former C.I.A. analyst and national security official, used her connections for a nearly two-week effort in which she and her staff worked with what she called a \u201cragtag network of people around the world\u201d to help with the evacuation of more than 100 Afghans to Albania.",
      "On Twitter, she thanked the former national security adviser H.R. McMaster and his \u201cnetworks of current and former military who helped this group onto buses and safely enter the airport after 23 hours of anxious waiting outside the gates.\u201d She also named two nongovernmental organizations \u2014 Vital Voices Global Partnership and Spirit of America \u2014 that had received the Afghans at the airport in Tirana, Albania, and were helping them get settled.",
      "Representative Richard Hudson, a Republican whose North Carolina district includes Fort Bragg, has been inundated with more than 700 requests from his constituents to help Afghans. He sent about 200 of them to Operation Flyaway to try to help.",
      "\u201cWe have worked closely with organizations including Raven Advisory, providing some limited assistance and logistical support,\u201d Mr. Hudson said in a statement. \u201cWe have also provided them a list of S.I.V.s that I am actively working to get out of Afghanistan,\u201d he added, referring to Special Immigrant Visas, meant for people who assisted U.S. military and diplomatic missions abroad.",
      "Raven Advisory\u2019s operation has more than 30 volunteers \u2014 including 25 military veterans \u2014 who have so far assisted 350 people in their flights from Afghanistan, including helping to fund an airlift with Sayara International and the Rockefeller Foundation of more than 50 people to Uganda.",
      "The operation has four more charter planes booked, and it is exploring other methods of leaving Afghanistan.",
      "Among those already evacuated are a female Afghan pilot and her family; a critically injured woman and her family; four interpreters and their families; and two orphans with a relative in Georgia.",
      "\u201cWe received a frantic call about two orphans whose parents had been killed by the Taliban,\u201d said Sheffield F. Ford III, the chief executive of Raven Advisory and an Army veteran who earned a Silver Star in Afghanistan. \u201cWe called all our different contacts in the military, from special operations to conventional forces to the Marines. It was incredible how they helped us. \u201d",
      "Mr. Ossoff declined through his office to comment on the operation, citing security concerns. But an aide said the senator had used other contacts from his days as a journalist to help get the orphans safely to the airport and onto a USAID plane out of Kabul.",
      "As they announced that the final U.S. military plane had left Afghanistan on Monday, Pentagon officials conceded that many people were likely to be left behind.",
      "\u201cWe did not get out everybody we wanted to get out,\u201d Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., the head of U.S. Central Command, told reporters. He said the United States would work hard through diplomatic channels to help Afghans who had worked with U.S. forces.",

    "title": "Is Vaccine Immunity Waning?",
    "content": [
      "Late last month, researchers in Israel released some alarming new Covid-19 data. The data showed that many Israelis who had been among the first to receive the vaccine were nonetheless catching the Covid virus. Israelis who had been vaccinated later were not getting infected as often.",
      "The study led to headlines around the world about waning immunity \u2014 the idea that vaccines lose their effectiveness over time. In the U.S., the Israeli study accelerated a debate about vaccine booster shots and played a role in the Biden administration\u2019s recent recommendation that all Americans receive a booster shot eight months after their second dose.",
      "But the real story about waning immunity is more complex than the initial headlines suggested. Some scientists believe that the Israeli data was misleading and that U.S. policy on booster shots has gotten ahead of the facts. The evidence for waning immunity is murky, these scientists say, and booster shots may not have a big effect.",
      "After returning from an August break last week, I have spent time reaching out to scientists to ask for their help in understanding the current, confusing stage of the pandemic. How worried should vaccinated people be about the Delta variant? How much risk do children face? Which parts of the Covid story are being overhyped, and which deserve more attention?",
      "I will be trying to answer these questions in the coming weeks. (I\u2019d also like to know what questions you want answered; submit them here.)",
      "One of the main messages I\u2019m hearing from the experts is that conventional wisdom about waning immunity is problematic. Yes, the immunity from the Covid vaccines will wane at some point. But it may not yet have waned in a meaningful way.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between needing another shot every six months versus every five years,\u201d Dr. David Dowdy, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, told me. \u201cSo far, looking at the data we have, I\u2019m not seeing much evidence that we\u2019ve reached that point yet.\u201d",
      "At first glance, the Israeli data seems straightforward: People who had been vaccinated in the winter were more likely to contract the virus this summer than people who had been vaccinated in the spring.",
      "Yet it would truly be proof of waning immunity only if the two groups \u2014 the winter and spring vaccine recipients \u2014 were otherwise similar to each other. If not, the other differences between them might be the real reason for the gap in the Covid rates.",
      "As it turns out, the two groups were different. The first Israelis to have received the vaccine tended to be more affluent and educated. By coincidence, these same groups later were among the first exposed to the Delta variant, perhaps because they were more likely to travel. Their higher infection rate may have stemmed from the new risks they were taking, not any change in their vaccine protection.",
      "Statisticians have a name for this possibility \u2014 when topline statistics point to a false conclusion that disappears when you examine subgroups. It\u2019s called Simpson\u2019s Paradox.",
      "This paradox may also explain some of the U.S. data that the C.D.C. has cited to justify booster shots. Many Americans began to resume more indoor activities this spring. That more were getting Covid may reflect their newfound Covid exposure (as well as the arrival of Delta), rather than any waning of immunity over time.",
      "Sure enough, other data supports the notion that vaccine immunity is not waning much.",
      "The ratio of positive Covid tests among older adults and children, for example, does not seem to be changing, Dowdy notes. If waning immunity were a major problem, we should expect to see a faster rise in Covid cases among older people (who were among the first to receive shots). And even the Israeli analysis showed that the vaccines continued to prevent serious Covid illness at essentially the same rate as before.",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s data proving the need for boosters, where is it?\u201d Zeynep Tufekci, the sociologist and Times columnist, has written.",
      "Part of the problem is that the waning-immunity story line is irresistible to many people. The vaccine makers \u2014 Pfizer, Moderna and others \u2014 have an incentive to promote it, because booster shots will bring them big profits. The C.D.C. and F.D.A., for their part, have a history of extreme caution, even when it harms public health. We in the media tend to suffer from bad-news bias. And many Americans are so understandably frightened by Covid that they pay more attention to alarming signs than reassuring ones.",
      "Here\u2019s my best attempt to give you an objective summary of the evidence, free from alarmism \u2014 and acknowledging uncertainty:",
      "Immunity does probably wane modestly within the first year of receiving a shot. For this reason, booster shots make sense for vulnerable people, many experts believe. As Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder of Bellevue Hospital Center told my colleague Apoorva Mandavilli, the C.D.C.\u2019s data \u201csupport giving additional doses of vaccine to highly immunocompromised persons and nursing home residents, not to the general public.\u201d",
      "The current booster shots may do little good for most people. The vaccines continue to provide excellent protection against illness (as opposed to merely a positive Covid test). People will eventually need boosters, but it may make more sense to wait for one specifically designed to combat a variant. \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether a non-Delta booster would improve protection against Delta,\u201d Dr. Aaron Richterman of the University of Pennsylvania told me.",
      "A national policy of frequent booster shots has significant costs, financially and otherwise. Among other things, the exaggerated discussion of waning immunity contributes to vaccine skepticism.",
      "While Americans are focusing on booster shots, other policies may do much more to beat back Covid, including more vaccine mandates in the U.S.; a more rapid push to vaccinate the world (and prevent other variants from taking root); and an accelerated F.D.A. study of vaccines for children.",
      "As always, we should be open to changing our minds as we get new evidence. As Richterman puts it, \u201cWe have time to gather the appropriate evidence before rushing into boosters.\u201d",

    "title": "Supreme Court Asked to Block Texas Law Banning Most Abortions",
    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Abortion providers in Texas asked the Supreme Court on Monday to block a state law banning abortions in the state as early as six weeks into pregnancy. The law, one of the most restrictive in the nation, is poised to go into effect on Wednesday.",
      "If the Supreme Court does not intervene, lawyers for the providers said, access to abortion in Texas could largely end. ",
      "\u201cIn less than two days, Texas politicians will have effectively overturned Roe v. Wade,\u201d said Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which represents the providers along with other groups.",
      "\u201cWe have filed an emergency motion in the Supreme Court to block this law before clinics are forced to turn patients away,\u201d she said. \u201cPatients will have to travel out of state \u2014 in the middle of a pandemic \u2014 to receive constitutionally guaranteed health care. And many will not have the means to do so.\u201d",
      "In their application, the abortion providers wrote that the law \u201cwould immediately and catastrophically reduce abortion access in Texas, barring care for at least 85 percent of Texas abortion patients (those who are six weeks pregnant or greater) and likely forcing many abortion clinics ultimately to close.\u201d",
      "The Texas law is at odds with Supreme Court precedents, which prohibit states from banning abortion before fetal viability, at about 22 to 24 weeks. But it has an unusual feature complicating efforts to challenge it in court.",
      "Instead of making state officials responsible for enforcing the law, it allows private citizens to sue abortion providers and others who help women obtain the procedure. That help can include financial assistance or giving a woman a ride to a clinic.",
      "The plaintiffs need not claim any connection to those they sue. If they prevail, the law entitles them to damages of at least $10,000, along with legal expenses.",
      "The law, the providers told the Supreme Court, \u201cattempts to replace normal civil-litigation rules and clearly established federal constitutional rules with distorted versions designed to maximize the abusive and harassing nature of the lawsuits and to make them impossible to fairly defend against.\u201d",
      "Taking state officials out of the equation complicated the providers\u2019 efforts to challenge the law in court, as such officials are the usual defendants in suits seeking to block laws. The providers instead also sued, among others, every state trial court judge and county court clerk in Texas.",
      "The defendants argued that abortion providers could challenge the constitutionality of the law only by violating it and raising their objections as defenses.",
      "A federal trial judge rejected a motion to dismiss the case and scheduled a hearing on whether to block the law. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, canceled the hearing.",
      "The challengers said that they are at minimum entitled to a decision on whether the law ought to be enjoined. If the Supreme Court does not act, they wrote, \u201capplicants and thousands of other Texans will be stripped of their fundamental constitutional rights on Wednesday without ever receiving a decision on their fully briefed request for a preliminary injunction.\u201d",
      "The Texas law is one of many efforts to limit abortions enacted in recent years in states controlled by Republicans. In 2021, state legislatures set the record for the most abortion restrictions signed in a single year in the United States, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which compiles data on abortion statistics and supports abortion rights.",
      "The Supreme Court has in the meantime become more conservative and now includes three members appointed by President Donald J. Trump, who had vowed to name justices prepared to overrule Roe v. Wade. The court will hear a major abortion case this fall concerning a Mississippi law that bans abortions after 15 weeks and amounts to a direct challenge to Roe."

      "The hospital has received reinforcements from the state and from the U.S. Department of Defense, all supplementing a staff that has been worn thin as the pandemic flared.",
      "Hospital officials are expecting patients to be brought in from other facilities in the region that have been severely damaged by the storm. \u201cWe can take on more, we will take on more,\u201d said Stephanie Manson, the hospital\u2019s chief operating officer.",
      "Conditions may be less than perfect, she said, but \u201cit\u2019s still a much better situation than where they were.\u201d",
      "Public health officials are also worried about how the hurricane will ultimately affect the pandemic in Louisiana, as people fleeing their homes pack in with relatives or into shelters with conditions conducive to the spread of the virus. Dr. O\u2019Neal said that similar concerns were raised last year after Hurricane Laura hit Southwest Louisiana, but those fears were not realized. \u201cWe were on the downswing when it hit,\u201d she said, \u201cand there was a great deal of testing that went on in those shelters.\u201d",
      "But the outcome might be different this time. \u201cWe know that Delta is different and it\u2019s far more contagious,\u201d Dr. O\u2019Neal said. \u201cBut we have learned to be patient.\u201d"

      "Oxygen supplies are running critically low in hospitals across Louisiana \u2014 with some only having one or two days of supply left \u2014 and any interruption brought by Hurricane Ida\u2019s destruction could be serious, according to Premier Inc., one of the largest hospital supply purchasing groups in the country.",
      "Ida pummeled much of the state on Sunday evening, leaving hundreds of thousands without power at a moment when hospitals across the Southeast had already been struggling with oxygen shortages for weeks. Driven by a surge in Covid-19 cases, some hospitals are relying on reserve tanks with no other backup options.",
      "\u201cThis is a rapidly evolving situation with access and roads \u2014 it remains to be seen what might happen in the days ahead,\u201d said Premier\u2019s chief customer officer, Andy Brailo. \u201cWhat we all want to avoid, obviously, is hospitals not being able to have the adequate oxygen supply for their patients or putting their patients at risk.\u201d",
      "He said delivery trucks have been giving hospitals partial refills because demand had been so high. Supply is further limited because oxygen needs to be delivered within hours, meaning that supplies must come from within a 250-mile radius of a hospital, he added. Premier is coordinating with the Federal Emergency Management Agency about the scarcity of oxygen in the region.",
      "The shortage goes beyond hospital supply. Mr. Brailo said individual canisters and tanks used by discharged Covid patients and those with disabilities were also in high demand. CrowdSource Rescue, a volunteer emergency response group, performed about a dozen oxygen-related rescues on Monday, including one of a woman who was dependent on oxygen after a Covid-19 infection, according to Loren Dykes, the group\u2019s director of operations.",
      "In the days ahead, Ms. Dykes said she expected to receive more oxygen-related distress calls, especially for Covid patients, who she said were not going to be as prepared as people with disabilities, who have more experience and tend to stockpile supplies.",
      "New Orleans has opened oxygen exchange sites for residents to get a full free tank of oxygen. Mike Hulefeld, chief operating officer for Ochsner Health, one of the largest hospital systems in Louisiana, said on Monday that thanks to generators, hospitals were faring well. The hospital network had 10 days\u2019 worth of supplies for the hospitals it anticipated would be hardest hit, and each of its locations had backup power and fuel.",
      "But those who rely on ventilators or oxygen concentrators to help them breathe, including recently discharged Covid-19 patients, are also going to be at increased risk because of the power outages. According to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services data on Medicare beneficiaries, there are 3,706 Medicare beneficiaries in Jefferson Parish who are dependent on power for their medical devices; in Orleans Parish, 2,215 Medicare beneficiaries are medically dependent on power."

    "title": "Transcript of Blinken\u2019s Speech on \u2018New Chapter\u2019 in Afghanistan",
    "content": [
      "The following is a transcript of Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken\u2019s remarks on Monday about the U.S. plan for engagement with Afghanistan after evacuations ended and the last American troops departed.",
      "Good evening, everyone.",
      "Eighteen days ago, the United States and our allies began our evacuation and relocation operation in Kabul. As you just heard from the Pentagon a few hours ago, that operation was completed. More than 123,000 people have been safely flown out of Afghanistan. That includes about 6,000 American citizens.",
      "This has been a massive military, diplomatic and humanitarian undertaking. One of the most difficult in the nation\u2019s history and an extraordinary feat of logistics and coordination under some of the most challenging circumstances imaginable. Many, many people made this possible.",
      "I want to commend our outstanding diplomats who worked around the clock, and around the world, to coordinate the operation. They volunteered for duty at the Kabul airport. They flew to transit countries to help process thousands of Afghans bound for the United States. They deployed to ports of entry and American military bases to welcome Afghans to their new homes.",
      "They staffed a 24/7 task force here in Washington, overseen by Deputy Secretary Brian McKeon. And they built a list of Americans possibly seeking to leave Afghanistan, then worked to contact every single one of them, repeatedly, making 55,000 phone calls, sending 33,000 emails since Aug. 14.",
      "They solved problem after problem to keep the mission moving forward. They did this because for the thousands of State Department and U.S.A.I.D. employees who served in Afghanistan in the past 20 years, this evacuation operation was very personal. Many worked hand in hand for years with Afghan partners, many of whom became trusted friends. We also lost cherished members of our foreign service community in Afghanistan. We\u2019ll never forget them.",
      "Helping Americans, our foreign partners who have been by our side for 20 years and Afghans at risk at this critical moment was more than just a high-stakes assignment for our team. It was a sacred duty. And the world saw how our diplomats rose to the challenge with determination and heart.",
      "U.S. service members in Kabul did heroic work securing the airport, protecting civilians of many nationalities, including tens of thousands of Afghans, and airlifting them out. They\u2019re also providing vital support right now caring for Afghans on military bases in Europe, the Middle East and here in the United States. We\u2019ve seen pictures of U.S. service members at the Kabul airport cradling babies, comforting families. That\u2019s the kind of compassion and courage our men and women in uniform exemplify.",
      "They carried out this mission under the constant threat of terrorist violence. And four days ago, 11 Marines, one Navy medic and one soldier were killed by a suicide bomber at the airport gate, as well as scores of Afghans. Nearly all of them were in their early 20s. Just babies or toddlers on Sept. 11, 2001. These deaths are a devastating loss for our country. We at the State Department feel them deeply.",
      "We have a special bond with the Marines. The first person that you see when you visit an American embassy is a marine. They guard our diplomatic missions. They keep us safe around the world. We couldn\u2019t do our jobs without them. And we will never forget their sacrifice, nor will we forget what they achieved. The most exceptional among us perform a lifetime\u2019s work of service in a short time here on Earth. So it was for our exceptional brothers and sisters who died last week.",
      "Finally, I want to thank our allies and partners. This operation was a global endeavor in every way. Many countries stepped up with robust contributions to the airlift, including working by our side at the airport. Some are now serving as transit countries, allowing evacuees to be registered and processed on their way to their final destinations. Others have agreed to resettle Afghan refugees permanently, and we hope more will do so in the days and weeks ahead. We\u2019re truly grateful for their support.",
      "Now U.S. military flights have ended. And our troops have departed Afghanistan. A new chapter of America\u2019s engagement with Afghanistan has begun. It\u2019s one in which we will lead with our diplomacy. The military mission is over. A new diplomatic mission has begun. So here is our plan for the days and weeks ahead:",
      "First, we built a new team to help lead this new mission. As of today, we suspended our diplomatic presence in Kabul and transferred our operations to Doha, Qatar, which will soon be formally notified to Congress. Given the uncertain security environment and political situation in Afghanistan, it was the prudent step to take. And let me take this opportunity to thank our outstanding charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires in Kabul, Ambassador Ross Wilson, who came out of retirement in January 2020 to lead our embassy in Afghanistan and has done exceptional, courageous work during a highly challenging time.",
      "For the time being, we will use this post in Doha to manage our diplomacy with Afghanistan, including consular affairs, administering humanitarian assistance and working with allies, partners and regional and international stakeholders to coordinate our engagement and messaging to the Taliban. Our team there will be led by Ian McCary, who served as our deputy chief of mission in Afghanistan for this past year. No one\u2019s better prepared to do the job.",
      "Second, we will continue our relentless efforts to help Americans, foreign nationals and Afghans leave Afghanistan if they choose.",
      "Let me talk briefly about the Americans who remain in Afghanistan.",
      "We made extraordinary efforts to give Americans every opportunity to depart the country. In many cases, talking and sometimes walking them into the airport. Of those who self-identified as Americans in Afghanistan who are considering leaving the country, we\u2019ve thus far received confirmation that about 6,000 have been evacuated or otherwise departed. This number will likely continue to grow as our outreach and arrivals continue.",
      "We believe there are still a small number of Americans, under 200 and likely closer to 100, who remain in Afghanistan and want to leave. We\u2019re trying to determine exactly how many. We\u2019re going through manifests and calling and texting through our lists, and we will have more details to share as soon as possible. Part of the challenge with fixing a precise number is that there are longtime residents of Afghanistan who have American passports and who are trying to determine whether or not they wanted to leave. Many are dual citizen Americans with deep roots and extended families in Afghanistan who resided there for many years. For many, it\u2019s a painful choice. Our commitment to them and to all Americans in Afghanistan and everywhere in the world continues.",
      "The protection and welfare of Americans abroad remains the State Department\u2019s most vital and enduring mission. If an American in Afghanistan tells us that they want to stay for now, and then in a week or a month or a year they reach out and say, \u2018I\u2019ve changed my mind,\u2019 we will help them leave. Additionally, we\u2019ve worked intensely to evacuate and relocate Afghans who worked alongside us and are at particular risk of reprisal. We\u2019ve gotten many out, but many are still there. We will keep working to help them. Our commitment to them has no deadline.",
      "Third, we will hold the Taliban to its pledge to let people freely depart Afghanistan. The Taliban is committed to let anyone with proper documents leave the country in a safe and orderly manner. They said this privately and publicly many times. On Friday, a senior Taliban official said it again on television and radio. And I quote: \u2018Any Afghans may leave the country, including those who worked for Americans if they want and for whatever reason there may be.\u2019",
      "More than half the world\u2019s countries have joined us in insisting that the Taliban let people travel outside Afghanistan freely. As of today, more than 100 countries have said that they expect the Taliban to honor travel authorizations by our countries. And just a few short hours ago, the United Nations security counsel passed a resolution that enshrines that responsibility, laying the groundwork to hold the Taliban accountable if they renege.",
      "So the international chorus on this is strong, and it will stay strong. We will hold the Taliban to their commitment on freedom of movement for foreign nationals, visa holders, at-risk Afghans.",
      "Fourth, we will work to secure their safe passage. This morning, I met with the foreign ministers of all the G7 countries \u2014 the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Canada, Italy, Japan \u2014 as well as Qatar, Turkey, the European Union and the secretary-general of NATO. We discussed how we will work together to facilitate safe travel out of Afghanistan, including by reopening Kabul\u2019s civilian airport as soon as possible, and we very much appreciate the efforts of Qatar and Turkey in particular to make this happen. This would enable a small number of daily charter flights, which is a key for anyone who wants to depart from Afghanistan moving forward.",
      "We\u2019re also working to identify ways to support Americans, legal permanent residents and Afghans who have worked with us and who may choose to depart via overland routes. We have no illusion that any of this will be easy or rapid. This will be an entirely different phase from the evacuation that just concluded. It will take time to work through a new set of challenges. But we will stay at it.",
      "John Bass, our former ambassador to Afghanistan, who returned to Kabul two weeks ago to help lead our evacuation efforts at the airport, will spearhead our ongoing work across the State Department to help American citizens and permanent residents, citizens of allied nations, special immigrant visa applicants and Afghans at high risk if any of those people wish to depart Afghanistan. We\u2019re deeply grateful for all that John did in Kabul, and for his commitment to this mission, as well as the extraordinary officers who are serving by his side.",
      "Fifth, we will stay focused on counterterrorism. The Taliban has made a commitment to prevent terrorist groups from using Afghanistan as a base for external operations that could threaten the United States or our allies, including Al Qaeda and the Taliban\u2019s sworn enemy, ISIS-K. Here, too, we will hold them accountable to that commitment. But while we have expectations of the Taliban, that doesn\u2019t mean we will rely on the Taliban. We will remain vigilant in monitoring threats ourselves and will maintain robust counterterrorism capabilities in the region to neutralize those threats if necessary, as we demonstrated in the past few days by striking ISIS facilitators and imminent threats in Afghanistan \u2014 and as we do in places around the world where we do not have military forces on the ground.",
      "Let me speak directly to our engagement with the Taliban across these and other issues. We engaged with the Taliban during the past few weeks to enable our evacuation operations. Going forward, any engagement with a Taliban-led government in Kabul will be driven by one thing only: our vital national interests. If we can work with the new Afghan government in a way that helps secure those interests, including the safe return of Mark Frerichs, a U.S. citizen who has been held hostage in the region since early last year, and in a way that brings greater stability to the country and region and protects the gains of the past two decades, we will do it.",
      "But we will not do it on the basis of trust or faith. Every step we take will be based not on what the Taliban-led government says but what it does to live up to its commitments. The Taliban seeks international legitimacy and support. Our message is any legitimacy and any support will have to be earned. The Taliban can do that by meeting commitments and obligations on freedom of travel, respecting the basic rights of the Afghan people, including women and minorities, upholding its commitments on counterterrorism, not carrying out reprisal violence against those who choose to stay in Afghanistan, and forming an inclusive government that can meet the needs and reflect the aspirations of the Afghan people.",
      "Sixth, we will continue our humanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistan. The conflict has taken a terrible toll on the Afghan people. Millions are internally displaced. Millions are facing hunger, even starvation. The Covid-19 pandemic has also hit Afghanistan hard. The United States will continue to support humanitarian aid to the Afghan people. Consistent with our sanctions on the Taliban, the aid will not flow through the government but rather through independent organizations such as U.N. agencies and N.G.O.s. And we expect that those efforts will not be impeded by the Taliban or anyone else.",
      "And seventh, we will continue our broad international diplomacy across all these issues and many others. We believe we can accomplish far more and exert far greater leverage when we work in coordination with our allies and partners. Over the last two weeks, we\u2019ve had a series of intensive diplomatic engagements with allies and partners to plan and coordinate the way ahead in Afghanistan. I met with the foreign ministers of NATO and the G7. I\u2019ve spoken one-on-one with dozens of my counterparts.",
      "Last week, president Biden met with the leaders of the G7 countries, and Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman has been convening a group of 28 allies and partners from all regions of the world every other day. Going forward, we\u2019ll coordinate closely with countries in the region and around the world as well as with leading organizations, N.G.O.s and the private sector. Our allies and partners share our objectives and are committed to working with us. I\u2019ll have more to say on these matters in the coming days.",
      "The main point I want to drive home here today is that America\u2019s work in Afghanistan continues. We have a plan for what\u2019s next. We\u2019re putting it into action. This moment also demands reflection. The war in Afghanistan was a 20-year endeavor. We must learn its lessons, and allow those lessons to shape how we think about fundamental questions of national security and foreign policy. We owe that to future diplomats, policymakers, military leaders, service members. We owe that to the American people.",
      "But as we do, we will be relentlessly focused on today and the future. We\u2019ll make sure we\u2019re finding every opportunity to make good on our commitment to the Afghan people, including by welcoming thousands of them into our communities \u2014 as the American people have done many times before \u2014 with generosity and grace throughout our history.",
      "In this way, we\u2019ll honor all those brave men and women from the United States and many other countries who risked or sacrificed their lives as part of this long mission, right up to today.",
      "Thanks for listening."

    "title": "Are Censures of Politicians a Form of Free Speech or a Threat to It?",
    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Last summer, the City Council in River Falls, Wis., censured a member for calling an opponent of wearing masks during the coronavirus pandemic \u201ca rancid tub of ignorant contagion.\u201d",
      "A few days later and a hundred miles away, the City Council in St. Cloud, Minn., censured one of its own for saying mask mandates were like requiring that \u201cCovid-positive people wear some sort of identification badge, maybe like a bright yellow star.\u201d",
      "Censures, which are formal reprimands and a kind of punishment, seem to be on the rise in these divisive times. The Supreme Court will hear arguments this fall on whether the First Amendment has anything to say about when elected bodies can impose them on their members.",
      "The justices will have to decide whether censures condemning politicians\u2019 statements are a threat to free speech that chills expression or a form of free speech responding to one set of views with another.",
      "The case before the justices was brought by David Wilson, a former elected trustee of the Houston Community College System and an energetic critic of its work. In addition to airing his concerns in interviews and on a website, Mr. Wilson sued the system\u2019s board, orchestrated robocalls and hired private investigators to look into whether another trustee had lied about where she lived.",
      "He was, a federal appeals court judge wrote in a dissent, a \u201cgadfly legislator.\u201d",
      "Mr. Wilson said there was plenty to criticize about the college system. In a Supreme Court brief, his lawyers said the board had been investigated for \u201crampant political graft.\u201d In 2018, a former trustee was convicted of accepting bribes from people seeking contracts with the college.",
      "That same year, Mr. Wilson\u2019s fellow board members censured him.",
      "\u201cThe board finds that Mr. Wilson\u2019s conduct was not only inappropriate, but reprehensible, and such conduct warrants disciplinary action,\u201d the resolution said.",
      "He sued, saying the punishment violated the First Amendment.",
      "A unanimous three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, allowed the case to proceed, ruling last year that punishing an elected official for his speech can run afoul of the Constitution.",
      "\u201cThe Supreme Court has long stressed the importance of allowing elected officials to speak on matters of public concern,\u201d Judge W. Eugene Davis wrote for the panel. \u201cA reprimand against an elected official for speech addressing a matter of public concern is an actionable First Amendment claim.\u201d",
      "Judge Davis acknowledged that the board had also imposed some punishments more concrete than a reprimand, like making Mr. Wilson ineligible for reimbursement for college-related travel. Those additional penalties, the judge wrote, did not violate his First Amendment rights.",
      "Mr. Wilson\u2019s lawyers told the justices that the power to censure must have limits. Elected bodies can censure their members for what they say during the lawmaking process, they wrote, and for conduct that is not protected by the First Amendment. But outside the official realm, they wrote, the First Amendment forbids \u201ca government body\u2019s official punishment of a speaker for merely expressing disagreement with a political majority.\u201d",
      "Those may appear to be fine distinctions. Mr. Wilson\u2019s brief in the case, Houston Community College System v. Wilson, No. 20-804, gave examples to illustrate how they would work outside the legislative process.",
      "\u201cA censure would be permissible for illegal marijuana use, for example, but not for statements supporting the legalization of marijuana use,\u201d the brief said. \u201cLikewise, a censure would be permissible for slander, but not for statements that merely criticize.\u201d",
      "The full Fifth Circuit deadlocked on whether to rehear the case, by an 8-to-8 vote. Dissenting from the decision to deny further review, Judge Edith H. Jones said the panel\u2019s First Amendment analysis was backward. The board\u2019s censure was itself speech worthy of protection, she wrote, particularly in a polarized era.",
      "\u201cGiven the increasing discord in society and governmental bodies, the attempts of each side in these disputes to get a leg up on the other, and the ready availability of weapons of mass communication with which each side can tar the other, the panel\u2019s decision is the harbinger of future lawsuits,\u201d Judge Jones wrote. \u201cIt weaponizes any gadfly in a legislative body.\u201d",
      "\u201cPolitical infighting of this sort,\u201d she wrote, \u201cshould not be dignified with a false veneer of constitutional protection and has no place in the federal courts.\u201d",
      "In a second dissent, Judge James C. Ho said that enduring condemnation is part of an elected official\u2019s job description.",
      "\u201cHolding office in America is not for the faint of heart,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWith leadership comes criticism \u2014 whether from citizens of public spirit or personal malice, colleagues with conflicting visions or competing ambitions, or all of the above.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court may embrace that view, based partly on decisions holding that the government is generally free to speak as it wishes.",
      "Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016, gave a crisp summary of that position in a 1986 opinion, when he was an appeals court judge. He concluded that the government was free to classify films as political propaganda and, more generally, to offer its point of view.",
      "\u201cWe know of no case,\u201d he wrote, \u201cin which the First Amendment has been held to be implicated by governmental action consisting of no more than governmental criticism of the speech\u2019s content.\u201d"

    "content": [
      "A controlled detonation by American forces that was heard throughout Kabul has destroyed Eagle Base, the final C.I.A. outpost outside the Kabul airport, U.S. officials said on Friday.",
      "Blowing up the base was intended to ensure that any equipment or information left behind would not fall into the hands of the Taliban.",
      "Eagle Base, first started early in the war at a former brick factory, had been used throughout the conflict. It grew from a small outpost to a sprawling center that was used to train the counterterrorism forces of Afghanistan\u2019s intelligence agencies.",
      "Those forces were some of the only ones to keep fighting as the government collapsed, according to current and former officials.",
      "\u201cThey were an exceptional unit,\u201d said Mick Mulroy, a former C.I.A. officer who served in Afghanistan. \u201cThey were one of the primary means the Afghan government has used to keep the Taliban at bay over the last 20 years. They were the last ones fighting, and they took heavy casualties.\u201d",
      "Local Afghans knew little about the base. The compound was extremely secure and designed to be all but impossible to penetrate. Walls reaching 10 feet high surrounded the site, and a thick metal gate slid open and shut quickly to allow cars inside.",
      "Once inside, cars still had to clear three outer security checkpoints where the vehicles would be searched and documents would be screened before being allowed inside the base.",
      "In the early years of the war, a junior C.I.A. officer was put in charge of the Salt Pit, a detention site near Eagle Base. There the officer ordered a prisoner, Gul Rahman, stripped of his clothing and shackled to a wall. He died of hypothermia. A C.I.A. board recommended disciplinary action but was overruled.",
      "A former C.I.A. contractor said that leveling the base would have been no easy task. In addition to burning documents and crushing hard drives, sensitive equipment needed to be destroyed so it did not fall into the hands of the Taliban. Eagle Base, the former contractor said, was not like an embassy where documents could be quickly burned.",
      "The base\u2019s destruction had been planned and was not related to the huge explosion at the airport that killed an estimated 170 Afghans and 13 American service members. But the detonation, hours after the airport attack, alarmed many people in Kabul, who feared that it was another terrorist bombing.",
      "The official American mission in Afghanistan to evacuate U.S. citizens and Afghan allies is set to end next Tuesday. The Taliban have said that the evacuation effort must not be prolonged, and Biden administration officials say that continuing past that date would significantly increase the risks to both Afghans and U.S. troops."

      "In between transfers, the president spread his legs wider, clasped his hands at his belt or behind his back, and frequently closed his eyes and bowed his head.",
      "A large group of federal dignitaries were on hand for the transfers, including Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III; Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken; Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and several members of Congress. One observer, who the White House later identified as Martha Carper, the wife of Senator Tom Carper, Democrat of Delaware, appeared to faint midway through one of the transfers.",
      "The White House did not announce the trip in advance. It is the first time Mr. Biden has witnessed the return of service members killed in the line of duty since assuming the presidency. The men and women killed in the Kabul attack were the first American service members killed by hostile forces since March 2020. Mr. Biden witnessed a transfer as vice president in 2016.",
      "\u201cThe 13 service members that we lost were heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice in service of our highest American ideals and while saving the lives of others,\u201d Mr. Biden said in a written statement released on Saturday. \u201cTheir bravery and selflessness has enabled more than 117,000 people at risk to reach safety thus far.\u201d"

      "GUANT\u00c1NAMO BAY, Cuba \u2014 Translation and interpretation problems on Monday delayed by one day military efforts to formally charge three Southeast Asian men \u2014 held by the United States for 18 years \u2014 with conspiring in deadly terrorist bombings in Indonesia in 2002 and 2003.",
      "Prosecutors accuse the three prisoners \u2014 Encep Nurjaman, who is known as Hambali; Mohammed Nazir Bin Lep; and Mohammed Farik Bin Amin \u2014 of murder, terrorism and conspiracy in the 2002 nightclub bombings in Bali, which killed 202 people, and the 2003 Marriott hotel bombing in Jakarta, which killed at least 11 people and wounded at least 80.",
      "Defense lawyers have called them torture victims who spent about three years in the secret C.I.A. prison network where agents used waterboarding, sleep deprivation, beatings, painful shackling and other now outlawed \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d techniques to extract information from their captives.",
      "In 2003, a C.I.A. interrogator told Mr. Hambali that he would never go to court, because \u201cwe can never let the world know what I have done to you,\u201d according to a study of the C.I.A. program that was released by the Senate Intelligence Committee in December 2014.",
      "Monday\u2019s formal charging was meant to be a crossroads of sorts, the start of proceedings in a case that was approved by a Trump administration appointee on Jan. 21, the first full day of President Biden\u2019s administration \u2014 and postponed by six months by pandemic restrictions.",
      "The proceedings ended up being the latest example of the delays that have plagued Guant\u00e1namo\u2019s justice system nearly 20 years after it was chosen to hold detainees captured after the Sept. 11 attacks and in the global effort to track down terrorists.",
      "All three men have been in the custody of the United States since 2003, and have been held at Guant\u00e1namo as members of Jemaah Islamiyah, a Southeast Asian extremist group. Mr. Hambali, who is Indonesian, is accused of allying himself with Osama bin Laden\u2019s global jihad, and sending Mr. Bin Amin and Mr. Bin Lep, former architecture students who met in college in Malaysia, to train in Qaeda camps in Afghanistan.",
      "Translation and technical issues were evident at the outset. One lawyer pointed out that a prisoner had mentioned \u201cGoogle\u201d in a remark in Malay for the judge, but the court interpreter did not mention the search engine in an English translation. The Indonesian translator turned \u201clegal training\u201d in English into \u201ctraining legal\u201d in Bahasa Indonesian.",
      "Defense lawyers said with alarm that all three defendants recognized a \u201cMr. Singh,\u201d a translator with whom they each had confidential conversations as they prepared to seek release through a review board hearing, sitting beside the lead prosecutor in court on Monday, now working for the prosecution.",
      "Lawyers for the three prisoners also told the judge that the court\u2019s official Indonesian translator had in 2020 offered the opinion that \u201cthe government is wasting money on these terrorists; they should have been killed a long time ago,\u201d and added that they had a sworn affidavit from a witness who heard the remark. Prosecutors are seeking life sentences in the case.",
      "Mr. Bin Lep\u2019s lawyer, Brian Bouffard, declared the Indonesian American contract translator \u201cirretrievably biased.\u201d Mr. Bin Amin\u2019s lawyer, Christine Funk, questioned why the prosecutors needed an interpreter at the arraignment hearing in the first place: \u201cAre they spying on us? I don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "The trial judge, Navy Cmdr. Hayes C. Larsen, tried to mend the problems. He gave the official court translation team 10-minute breaks every 20 minutes. He told defense lawyers to file legal motions if they believed there were interpretation problems that required remedies. And he postponed until Tuesday the reading of the charges, which was the reason for Monday\u2019s hearing.",
      "Defense lawyers, both civilian and military, and all paid by the Pentagon, described the case as still in its infancy. Prosecutors, they said, had provided perhaps 2 percent of the pretrial documents that could be used in the case, including accounts of interrogations the F.B.I. did in 2007 with the prisoners soon after their transfer to military custody from the C.I.A. Prosecutors declined to comment.",
      "Mr. Hambali\u2019s lawyer, James R. Hodes, called the case \u201cabsurd,\u201d in part because of the length of his client\u2019s detention and the nearly two-decade delay in bringing charges against him. He told reporters before the hearing that Mr. Hambali had been \u201cbrutalized\u201d and spent at least half of his detention in solitary confinement. He said the prisoner was owed \u201can apology\u201d and repatriation, \u201cnot to be held in a cage in a Caribbean island.\u201d",
      "Hearings at Guant\u00e1namo have been mostly held between English and Arabic, but have also suffered translation problems. In 2015, one of the men accused of plotting the Sept. 11 attacks blurted out the name of a translator in court \u2014 and disclosed that the linguist had previously worked for the C.I.A. at a black site, exposing his identity and derailing a week of hearings.",
      "Finding U.S. translators with top-secret security clearances who speak Southeast Asian languages has apparently proved even more of a challenge. The Senate study of the C.I.A.\u2019s interrogation program cited a January 2004 cable from a secret detention site that reported that Mr. Bin Lep\u2019s \u201cEnglish is very poor, and we do not have a Malay linguist.\u201d"

      "Masks will be required for students, staff and visitors in public and private schools, early learning programs and child care centers in Pennsylvania beginning Sept. 7. The mandate was imposed by order of the state\u2019s acting secretary of health, Alison Beam, who appeared at a news conference with Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat.",
      "\u201cWearing a mask in school is necessary to keep our children in the classroom, and to keep Covid out,\u201d Mr. Wolf said.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended masking for everyone inside a school, regardless of vaccination status, as a way to keep students safe for in-person schooling. Extra safety measures are especially important in schools because no coronavirus vaccine has been federally authorized for children younger than 12, health officials have said.",
      "Republican politicians around the country contend that imposing mask requirements infringes on individual liberties, and many states with Republican governors, notably Florida and Texas, have fought mask mandates by school districts and localities.",
      "Some districts have instituted mask mandates anyway, leading to legal battles. The U.S. Department of Education announced on Monday that it was beginning an investigation into whether bans on mask mandates in five states violated civil rights laws that protect disabled students.",

      "They dropped retardant chemicals through an ash-filled sky and bulldozed trees and brush to slow the march of the flames through the steep and rugged terrain of the Sierra Nevada. Yet the fire still advanced.",
      "Bursting across a granite ridge into the Lake Tahoe basin, the Caldor fire now threatens tens of thousands of homes and hotels that ring the lake.",
      "On Tuesday, the smoke-choked streets of South Lake Tahoe, the most populous city on the lake, were deserted, save for police patrol cars and an occasional convoy of fire vehicles. Thousands of residents and tourists had been evacuated the day before.",
      "The lake, renowned for its bright blue hues and the evergreen forests that surround it, was smothered in a slate of sickly orange-gray haze. On the Nevada side of the border, which has not yet been evacuated, one industry was still limping along: A trickle of gamblers sat at slot machines to the whooshing sound of large air purifiers that attempted to keep out the pungent smoke. The air quality index was nearing 500, a level considered hazardous.",
      "Battling the Caldor fire has been humbling and harrowing for California firefighters. Experts believe that the challenge is a cautionary tale for future megafires in the West and lays bare a certain futility in trying to fully control the most aggressive wildfires.",
      "\u201cNo matter how many people you have out on these fires, it\u2019s not a large enough work force to put the fire out,\u201d said Malcolm North, a fire expert with the U.S. Forest Service and a professor at the University of California, Davis.",
      "\u201cYou can save particular areas or particular homes,\u201d Professor North said. \u201cBut the fire is pretty much going to do what it\u2019s going to do until the weather shifts.\u201d",
      "On Monday, propelled by strong winds, the fire crested a granite ridge that officials had hoped would serve as a natural barrier. Embers leapfrogged past firefighting crews and descended toward the valley floor just miles from South Lake Tahoe. By early Tuesday, the fire had taken hold in the Tahoe basin. Stands of pine ignited by flying embers were fully engulfed in flames, casting a bright orange glow into the night sky.",
      "It was only the second time, officials said, that a wildfire that began on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada crossed into the eastern side. The first was also this summer: the Dixie fire, the second largest in California history. No deaths have been reported in either fire.",
      "The authorities say about 27,000 firefighters were battling blazes across the country, about 15,000 of them in California. All national forests in California will be closed by Tuesday night. Hundreds of soldiers and airmen and several military aircraft have been sent by the National Guard. But the resources are no match for the ferocious blazes, which continue to outpace firefighters and explode across the state.",
      "The blazes in Sierra forests have exposed the domino effects of climate change on firefighting challenges: Frequent heat waves and overall higher temperatures have desiccated West Coast flora, making it more vulnerable to large fires. Droughts have weakened trees, encouraging insect infestations that have contributed to the deaths of close to 150 million trees. This creates more fuel for fires.",
      "Scientists say there is also a correlation between global warming and the increased wind conditions that have fanned fierce wildfires across the state. And they point to a need for better forest management, thinning out some of the thickest woods.",
      "What characterizes the megafires of recent years, experts said, is their tendency to launch embers far ahead of the main fire front \u2014 sometimes by miles \u2014 and for the embers to land on parched terrain that is instantly combustible. This can rapidly expand the perimeter of the fire, which hops over one of the main containment tools: the bulldozed areas, known as fire breaks, that create a line of containment.",
      "The Tubbs fire in October 2017 jumped over what would normally be considered a formidable fire break \u2014 a six-lane freeway \u2014 and went on to incinerate 1,200 homes in the residential community of Coffey Park.",
      "\u201cThese spot fires are causing a lot of havoc,\u201d said Craig Clements, a professor of meteorology and the director of the Wildfire Interdisciplinary Research Center at San Jose State University, a group that is modeling the spread of the Caldor fire.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just fire all around,\u201d Professor Clements added, \u201cand that makes it very difficult to suppress.\u201d As a measure of how combustible the landscape has become, other scientists have calculated that embers have a 90 percent chance of becoming spot fires once they land.",
      "The chaotic way these megafires spread was on display in the hills above South Lake Tahoe on Monday. Kyle Hukkanen was leading a crew of 12 inmate firefighters armed with axes, shovels and chain saws. They bounded down a steep hillside of granite boulders and evergreen trees until they reached a spot where wisps of smoke were rising from the ground.",
      "They dug and sprayed the smoldering fire with water before ascending back to their idling truck. \u201cThis is not good,\u201d Mr. Hukkanen said as gusts of wind fed the spot fire on the hillsides. The radio crackled with reports of spotting farther down the mountain toward South Lake Tahoe, and Mr. Hukkanen and his crew disappeared down a smoke-shrouded road.",
      "Fire specialists say some firefighting tools are appropriate on a smaller scale but outmatched by the huge fires of recent years.",
      "In the hills and gullies where the Caldor fire has burned 190,000 acres over the past two weeks, helicopters dropped large buckets of water \u2014 thousands of gallons at a time \u2014 but they hardly seemed a match.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s great for protecting a neighborhood, but when you think about the size of a 750,000-acre fire, that\u2019s nothing,\u201d Professor North, the U.S. Forest Service expert, said of dropping water or retardant in large swaths of forest.",
      "He and others added that the Sisyphean task of fire containment pointed to a desperate need for better mitigation.",
      "Controlled burns that embrace Indigenous methods to use \u201cgood\u201d fire to fight destructive megafires have become an increasingly accepted method in recent years, but experts say the state has a lot of catching up to do.",
      "Until then, attempts to suppress fire are inevitably required to save lives and property. In the past year, California spent more than $1 billion on emergency fire suppression efforts but slashed its prevention budget. This year\u2019s budget includes more than $500 million for fire prevention, Gov. Gavin Newsom said in April.",
      "Still, resources remain strained. The U.S. Forest Service has struggled to retain federal firefighters, who earn around half of their state counterparts\u2019 pay at Cal Fire. When the Caldor fire ballooned to 6,500 acres in mid-August, just 242 firefighters had been assigned to it. Eventually, hundreds more were redeployed from the Dixie fire, which has razed more than 800,000 acres and was less than half contained on Tuesday afternoon.",
      "On the receiving end of the worsening blazes are the residents who wonder where, if anywhere, will be safe from wildfire.",
      "Among the evacuees from South Lake Tahoe were Darren Cobrae, a real estate investor, and his partner, Stephanie Cothern, who was driving the couple\u2019s car toward the Nevada state line.",
      "Inside were bags of clothing, two large parrots and three dogs, Banana, Freddy and Copper.",
      "Mr. Cobrae said he moved to South Lake Tahoe from Southern California, where his home was nearly burned in a wildfire in 2007.",
      "\u201cI figured I would be safe in this city,\u201d Mr. Cobrae said. \u201cAnd now this,\u201d he said, pointing to a sky thickening with smoke."

    "content": [
      "GUANT\u00c1NAMO BAY, Cuba \u2014 Three men who have been detained by the United States for 18 years without charge were formally accused of war crimes on Tuesday as part of a global Qaeda conspiracy that began in Afghanistan in 1996 and resulted in the grisly Bali nightclub bombings in 2002.",
      "The lead defendant, an Indonesian man called Encep Nurjaman, who is known as Hambali, and two Malaysian men, Mohammed Nazir Bin Lep and Mohammed Farik Bin Amin, offered no pleas. No trial date was set, and defense lawyers indicated they would seek to disqualify the arraignment of their clients as defective because of translation problems.",
      "The case is the first new prosecution at the troubled military commissions system since 2014. It had been dormant for years, the men held as enemy combatants, until a Trump administration appointee abruptly approved the case on the first full day of the Biden administration without explanation.",
      "Defense lawyers say that potential witnesses have died or disappeared and that some of the men named as accomplices have been executed in Indonesia or killed in clashes with security services.",
      "One key issue, the lawyers said, was the discovery that the woman who served as the court\u2019s official translator of Bahasa Indonesian had remarked last year that \u201cthe government is wasting money on these terrorists; they should have been killed a long time ago.\u201d Defense lawyers called her biased and sought to halt the proceeding, which was already delayed for six months because of the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "But the Navy judge, Cmdr. Hayes C. Larsen, presiding in his first military commission case, ruled that the Pentagon-paid translators were \u201cqualified\u201d and \u201ccertified\u201d by war court headquarters and so what the defendants heard in their headsets was sound.",
      "Brian Bouffard, a lawyer representing Mr. Bin Lep, disagreed. He said, for starters, that the translations were so flawed that he had \u201cno confidence\u201d that the defendants understood the process, and that he had no trustworthy interpreter to assist him.",
      "Mr. Bin Lep found the translation of the proceedings into his first language, Malay, so inscrutable that he switched to his second language, Bahasa, and listened to the charges against him translated by \u201csomeone who we know would have liked it if he was summarily executed years ago,\u201d Mr. Bouffard said.",
      "The defense lawyers had already refused to work with their teams\u2019 Defense Department contract linguists, translators who had been vetted by the government to receive top-secret security clearances and help them communicate with the prisoners. All three defendants were held by the C.I.A. in the early years of their detention and were tortured, according to the lawyers, who said they did not trust that the government\u2019s choice of linguists would keep their conversations confidential.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve had 18 years to get us translators and interpreters for these guys,\u201d said James Hodes, Mr. Hambali\u2019s lead lawyer. \u201cBut the system is so flawed.\u201d",
      "The case is complex, charging murder, terrorism, attacking civilians and conspiracy. The charges cast two bombings in Indonesia in 2002 and 2003 as acts of war by a Qaeda affiliate after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. On a Saturday night in Bali in October 2002, suicide bombers struck at two popular nightspots, Paddy\u2019s Pub and the Sari Club, killing more than 200 people, mostly Australians and Indonesians as well as seven Americans.",
      "In a sweeping charge sheet, which an Air Force prosecutor read aloud in English for about 95 minutes Tuesday, Mr. Hambali was described as ordering recruits to his Jemaah Islamiyah movement to plot bombings of \u201cbars, cafes or nightclubs frequented by \u2018Westerners\u2019 in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand\u201d in late 2001 and early 2002. It also described Mr. Hambali as so aware of what would happen in Bali that he arranged to rent a hotel room in advance to watch the news on CNN.",
      "The charges did not directly tie the Malaysian defendants to the Bali bombing. Instead, they were described as associates of Mr. Hambali who trained in Qaeda camps in Afghanistan and, at his direction, conducted surveillance in 1999 of other U.S., Israeli and tourist targets in Southeast Asia for plots that never took place. They were also accused of helping him elude capture by securing fake documents, weapons and safe-house lodging.",
      "Mr. Bin Lep and Mr. Bin Amin are also accused of hiding $50,000 at their apartment in Bangkok that Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who is accused of masterminding the Sept. 11 attacks, sent for follow-on attacks in 2002. Prosecutors suggested it was used to fund a car bombing at a Marriott hotel in Jakarta, Indonesia, in August 2003, killing 11 people and wounding at least 80 others.",
      "By then, Mr. Bin Amin had been arrested. The other two men would soon be detained, and like him, spend more than three years in secret C.I.A. prisons before President George W. Bush had them transferred to military custody at Guant\u00e1namo Bay with Mr. Mohammed and 10 other so-called high-value detainees."

      "Hurricane Ida made landfall southwest of New Orleans on Sunday as a Category 4 hurricane before moving into Mississippi, walloping hospitals in two states that were already brimming with Covid patients.",
      "Louisiana has the country\u2019s fifth-highest Covid hospitalization rate; Mississippi has the third-highest. Both states have coronavirus vaccination rates well below 50 percent, and many of their hospitals were struggling with an onslaught of Covid patients even before the storm arrived.",
      "Ochsner Health, Louisiana\u2019s largest hospital system, was working to evacuate 66 patients from two hospitals after \u201cwinds shattered double-pane windows and blew off roofing, sending water trickling into patient rooms,\u201d The Advocate reported on Sunday night. In a briefing, Ochsner said the hospitals\u2019 emergency rooms would stay open despite persistent challenges with staffing.",
      "As the storm bore down on Baton Rouge, La., officials at Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center, already strained by Covid patients, expected to take on more patients from other facilities in the region, having received reinforcements from the state and the federal government. On Sunday, part of another hospital\u2019s roof blew off.",
      "In the aftermath of the storm, officials are focused on restoring power. The whole of New Orleans is without electricity, with no timeline for its restoration. \u201cI hate to say it this way, but we have a lot of people on ventilators today and they don\u2019t work without electricity,\u201d Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana told The Associated Press.",
      "The ripple effects of the storm on the pandemic are still taking shape. Oxygen supplies are running critically low in hospitals across Louisiana \u2014 with some only having one or two days left of supply. Delivery trucks have been giving hospitals partial refills because of demand, a representative of one of the largest hospital supply purchasing groups in the country told The Times.",
      "Individual canisters used by discharged patients are also in high demand. CrowdSource Rescue, a volunteer emergency response group, did about a dozen oxygen-related rescues on Monday. The city of New Orleans has opened oxygen exchange sites for residents to get a free full tank of oxygen.",
      "The average for hospitalized Covid-19 patients in the United States is now more than 100,000 per day over the past week. That\u2019s higher than in any previous surge except last winter\u2019s, before most Americans were eligible to get vaccinated, when hospitalizations peaked at nearly 140,000 in mid-January.",
      "This month, one in five American I.C.U.s had reached or exceeded 95 percent of capacity. The crisis is concentrated in the South, fueled by some of the country\u2019s lowest vaccination rates and widespread political opposition to public health measures like mask requirements.",
      "Dr. Ijlal Babar, the director of pulmonary critical care for the Singing River Health System in coastal Mississippi, said the influx of mostly unvaccinated, younger Covid-19 patients was hampering care across the system\u2019s hospitals.",
      "\u201cBecause a lot of these patients are lingering on, the ventilators are occupied, the beds are occupied,\u201d he said.",
      "Mississippi was uniquely unprepared to handle what is now the worst coronavirus outbreak in the nation. There are 2,000 fewer nurses in Mississippi today than there were at the beginning of the year, according to the state hospital association. The state has fewer active physicians per capita than any other.",
      "The state rejected a proposal to expand Medicaid, the federally subsidized health insurance program for low-income residents, a decision that critics say has deprived Mississippi of a much-needed infusion of federal money. What Mississippi has been left with, after years of infighting over health care policy, is a system believed to be the weakest in the nation.",
      "Most days, the University of Mississippi Medical Center, the largest in the state, has upward of two dozen patients waiting in the emergency ward and other parts of the hospital for intensive care beds to free up.",
      "The state announced last week that it was signing up more than 1,000 contract health care workers to address the hospital labor shortage, at a cost of $10 million per week \u2014 a cost that will eventually be borne by the federal government.",
      "See how the vaccine rollout is going in your county and state.",
      "My current job is to identify, plan, coordinate and work mobile Covid-19 vaccine events, focusing on medically underserved communities where health disparities are apparent. Hours are long and the work is very hands on. Our team works rain or shine in the Texas summer heat and manages a smile for every patient. Recently, my 11-year-old son turned his room into a \u201ccalming room\u201d for me. In the middle was a single chair. Surrounded by ambient light and calm music, he offered me a tray of various toys and gadgets that I could \u201cfidget\u201d with. What a sweet moment to share with my boy amid the chaos and noise. \u2014 Katt Anderson, Allen, Texas",
      "Let us know how you\u2019re dealing with the pandemic. Send us a response here, and we may feature it in an upcoming newsletter.",

    "content": [
      "California became the first state to issue a vaccine mandate for all educators in public and private schools on Wednesday when Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered teachers and school staff members to provide proof of vaccination against Covid-19 or face weekly testing.",
      "\u201cWe think it\u2019ll be well-received to keep our most precious resource healthy and safe,\u201d he said, \u201cand that\u2019s our children.\u201d",
      "The policy applies to staff members serving students in kindergarten through 12th grade and will go into effect on Thursday, with the deadline for full compliance being Oct. 15.",
      "Similar mandates are gaining momentum among public and private employers as cases across the United States have jumped with the spread of the Delta variant.",
      "",
      "",
      "In Hawaii, officials announced last week that all state and county employees, including public-school teachers, must be vaccinated or be tested weekly. But California\u2019s policy goes a step further by including private schools.",
      "While California officials initially emphasized they were merely encouraging everyone to get vaccinated, the governor announced late last month that the state would require vaccines or testing at least weekly for health-care workers and state government employees. Last week, state health officials made the requirement even more stringent, largely removing the testing option for more than two million health-care workers. But it wasn\u2019t clear then whether California would extend a mandate to hundreds of thousands of educators.",
      "Debate over how to safely reopen schools has been intense and ongoing for months, and decisions over whether to require inoculations have emerged as a recent flash point.",
      "Over the weekend, Randi Weingarten, the head of the American Federation of Teachers, expressed her strongest support to date for mandatory vaccination of educators, saying she would urge her union\u2019s leadership to reconsider its opposition to vaccine mandates.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a new thing to have immunizations in schools,\u201d Ms. Weingarten said on NBC\u2019s  \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cAnd I think that on a personal matter, as a matter of personal conscience, I think that we need to be working with our employers, not opposing them, on vaccine mandates.\u201d",
      "Cecily Myart-Cruz, the president of United Teachers Los Angeles,  said in a statement that the group \u201cdoesn\u2019t oppose\u201d the vaccine mandate \u2014 but it alone is not enough.",
      "\u201cVaccines are like seatbelts: necessary but not invincible,\u201d she said in a statement on Wednesday. The Los Angeles Unified School District\u2019s practice of testing students and staff members weekly, even if they have been vaccinated, \u201cexceeds the requirement announced by Governor Gavin Newsom today,\u201d the statement said.",
      "For Mr. Newsom, getting children back into classrooms is a task with particularly high stakes. Next month, voters will be asked whether they want to recall the governor, and frustration among parents over prolonged school closures has been a significant driver of support for his ouster.",
      "Speaking in Oakland, on Wednesday,  the governor was flanked by local elected officials who drew an explicit contrast between the pandemic response by Mr. Newsom, a Democrat, and states where conservative leaders  are seeking to block vaccine mandates and masking requirements.",
      "Schools were closed longer in California than in many other states in large part because of a brutal winter surge, but also because of protracted negotiations with teachers unions, who demanded extensive safety precautions.",
      "On Wednesday, the president of the California Teachers Association, the state\u2019s largest  and an affiliate of the National Education Association, said it supported the vaccine mandate.",
      "\u201cEducators want to be in classrooms with their students, and the best way to make sure that happens is for everyone who is medically eligible to be vaccinated, with robust testing and multitiered safety measures,\u201d the union president, E. Toby Boyd, said in a statement.",

    "title": "Virginia School Board to Pay $1.3 Million in Transgender Student\u2019s Suit",
    "content": [
      "A school board in Virginia has agreed to pay $1.3 million in legal fees to resolve a discrimination lawsuit filed by a former student whose efforts to use the boys\u2019 bathroom put him at the center of a national debate over rights for transgender people.",
      "Gavin Grimm\u2019s battle with the Gloucester County school board began in 2014, when he was a sophomore and his family informed his school that he was transgender. Administrators were supportive at first. But after an uproar from some parents and students, the school board adopted a policy requiring students to use the bathrooms and locker rooms for their \u201ccorresponding biological genders.\u201d",
      "Mr. Grimm sued the school board. The legal battle pushed him into the national spotlight as Republican-controlled state legislatures introduced a wave of \u201cbathroom bills\u201d requiring transgender people to use public restrooms in government and school buildings that correspond to the gender listed on their birth certificates.",
      "\u201cWe are glad that this long litigation is finally over and that Gavin has been fully vindicated by the courts, but it should not have taken over six years of expensive litigation to get to this point,\u201d Joshua Block, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who represented Mr. Grimm, said in a statement on Thursday. Mr. Block added that he hoped that the outcome would \u201cgive other school boards and lawmakers pause before they use discrimination to score political points.\u201d",
      "The Gloucester County Public Schools superintendent\u2019s office declined to comment, instead noting in a terse statement that the school board had \u201caddressed\u201d the request to pay Mr. Grimm\u2019s legal fees.",
      "In his own statement, Mr. Grimm said the school board had chosen a \u201ccostly legal battle\u201d over providing him access to a safe environment. \u201cI hope that this outcome sends a strong message to other school systems, that discrimination is an expensive losing battle,\u201d he said.",
      "The ACLU said the school board\u2019s \u201cdegrading and stigmatizing policy\u201d excluded Mr. Grimm even after he started receiving hormone therapy that altered his bone and muscle structure, deepened his voice and caused him to grow facial hair.",
      "The harm continued after Mr. Grimm graduated, the group said: The school district refused to provide him with a transcript that matched his gender identity, so he had to provide colleges and potential employers with a transcript that identified him as female.",
      "In an interview on Monday, Mr. Grimm said he was hopeful about the progress that had been made, even as the debate over transgender rights has intensified.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re making strides every single solitary day,\u201d he said. \u201cState by state, courtroom by courtroom, the right decisions are being made and trans equality is being upheld in the courts.\u201d",
      "A consequence of the increased visibility of transgender people, Mr. Grimm said, is that \u201cdetractors also gain visibility as they weaponize this in some sort of culture war to mobilize other political issues.\u201d",
      "The settlement was announced two months after the Supreme Court let stand a lower-court ruling in Mr. Grimm\u2019s favor. A divided three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled last year that the school board\u2019s policy violated the Constitution and federal law. The Supreme Court gave no reason for declining to hear the school board\u2019s appeal of that ruling.",
      "The Supreme Court had agreed to hear an earlier appeal in Mr. Grimm\u2019s case but dismissed it in 2017 after the Trump administration changed the federal government\u2019s position on transgender rights. The Biden administration has since adopted policies protecting transgender students.",
      "The central question in the case was whether Title IX, the federal law banning gender discrimination in schools that receive federal money, also prohibited discrimination based on gender identity.",
      "Some supporters of transgender rights had hoped for a sweeping Supreme Court ruling that would grant new rights for transgender people. But Mr. Grimm welcomed the court\u2019s rejection of the school board\u2019s appeal as a victory.",
      "\u201cI am glad that my yearslong fight to have my school see me for who I am is over,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cBeing forced to use the nurse\u2019s room, a private bathroom and the girls\u2019 room was humiliating for me, and having to go to out-of-the-way bathrooms severely interfered with my education. Trans youth deserve to use the bathroom in peace without being humiliated and stigmatized by their own school boards and elected officials.\u201d"

    "title": "Evacuations Ordered Near Lake Tahoe as the Caldor Fire Chokes Region",
    "content": [
      "A wildfire that had burned through remote areas in the Sierra Nevada for two weeks crested a ridge on Monday and began descending toward the major population centers along Lake Tahoe.",
      "As the Caldor fire intensified amid dry and windy conditions, thousands of people along the lake\u2019s southern and western shores were ordered to evacuate. Crews of firefighters sped to put out spot fires only miles from South Lake Tahoe, Calif.",
      "Tourists normally swarm the lake on the California-Nevada border in the summer months for boating, fishing, hiking, eating and drinking. But by sunset on Monday, the community seemed to stand still.",
      "On streets that were clogged only hours earlier, shops and businesses \u2014 motels, restaurants, supermarkets \u2014 were deserted. Roads were empty except for fire engines and television reporters documenting the eerie calm.",
      "It was impossible to know when, if at all, the fire would reach the town. But people did not stay to test the fury of a blaze that fire officials estimate could threaten more than 20,000 structures.",
      "Public safety officials warned that the Caldor fire, the latest to grip California during a particularly unforgiving summer for fire crews in the West, showed no signs of relenting. It had scorched more than 186,000 acres and was 15 percent contained on Monday.",
      "The mandatory evacuation zone extended from Tahoma, Calif., on the western shore of the lake, to the Nevada border. \u201cIt was a tense few moments, I think, for our citizens in South Lake Tahoe today,\u201d David Stevenson, the city\u2019s police chief, said during a news conference on Monday evening.",
      "Beginning on Tuesday, almost all national forests in California will be closed through Sept. 17 for public safety reasons. The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning for the northern Sierra Nevada and the southern Cascades, meaning that extremely dry conditions and wind gusts of up to 35 miles per hour were likely to cause wildfires to spread in the mountains.",
      "The warning will remain in effect until 11 p.m. on Wednesday for the area, which was cloaked in haze on Monday. Smoke from the fire had deteriorated the air quality to unhealthy levels, the U.S. Forest Service said.",
      "Firefighters on Monday were battling blazes along a dozen-mile section of an old Pony Express route that connects Gold Rush towns along the thickly forested western slope of the Sierra Nevada. At points, crews drew water from the American River to extinguish spot fires and protect the cabins dotted along Highway 50.",
      "Even at 5,000 feet of elevation, temperatures in the midafternoon were in the 90s, unusually hot for the Sierra. Patches of fire burned on both sides of the road.",
      "In the heart of the fire, the skies were orange and the valleys a dense slate of impenetrable smoke.",
      "Along the granite cliffs that descend to the Lake Tahoe basin, firefighters chased down a spot fire that had ignited on the slopes in the direction of South Lake Tahoe. Firefighters and city officials had hoped that the wall of granite would serve as a protective shield for the communities along Lake Tahoe. But winds carried embers that leaped down the cliffs.",
      "Many evacuees grappled with bumper-to-bumper traffic after several major roads in the area were closed. Photographs showed cars at a standstill on Highway 50, the main artery along the southeastern shoreline of the lake.",
      "Chief Stevenson said he had been stuck for about three and a half hours on Highway 50 on Monday.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so appreciative that our citizens listened to the warning and the order, and evacuated the city,\u201d he said.",
      "The lake, which is known for its sapphire waters and evergreen-surrounded coves, is particularly popular with vacationers from the Bay Area. It is home to several famous ski resorts and casinos, which are just over the border from South Lake Tahoe in Stateline, Nev. Several concerts that had been scheduled for this week at Harveys Lake Tahoe casino were postponed because of the fire threat.",
      "Although wildfires occur throughout the West every year, scientists see the influence of climate change in the extreme heat waves that have contributed to the intensity of fires this summer. Prolonged periods of abnormally high temperatures are a signal of a shifting climate, they say.",
      "As the Caldor fire threatened Lake Tahoe, the Dixie fire, the largest single-origin wildfire in California history, continued to rage in the northern part of the state. That fire had burned more than 771,000 acres in five counties as of Monday and was about 48 percent contained, according to Cal Fire."

    "content": [
      "HOUSTON \u2014 As an interpreter working alongside the U.S. military in Afghanistan, Zar Mohammad Yousafzai taught English to Afghan soldiers and Pashto to American troops. He helped negotiate agreements with tribal leaders to halt attacks on Americans and instructed Afghans on how to use American weapons.",
      "He dodged mortar attacks and Taliban ambushes and, eventually, repeated death threats from insurgents who regarded him as a spy. One text message read: \u201cYou are a traitor. You work for the infidels. We are going to kill you.\u201d His third son, just 7 at the time, was kidnapped for ransom by militants in 2017.",
      "On Aug. 14, as the Taliban were storming across Afghanistan, his family of nine was evacuated on a U.S. military flight. By the time they touched down in Virginia, the insurgents had entered Kabul and taken full control of the country.",
      "\u201cEveryone is calling me and saying, \u2018You are a very lucky person,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "This week, the family was settling into the a new apartment in Southwest Houston. The atmosphere was festive. Brand-new kitchen items, cleaning supplies and toys, donated by a local nonprofit group, spilled out of large storage bins. Brishna, 13; Huzzaif, 11; and Murtaza, 2, blew bubbles.",
      "But Mr. Yousafzai and his wife, Bibi, worried for the fate of several brothers, nephews and cousins, who also had worked for the Americans. The attack on Thursday at the Kabul airport and the fast-approaching U.S. withdrawal made it less likely that they would get out any time soon.",
      "Despite all the trauma, they said, their only daughter now has a future very different from the one she would have had in a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. \u201cI can study in school and become somebody,\u201d Brishna said.",
      "And for Huzzaif, who was kidnapped four years ago and held for ransom, there would no longer be any fear. \u201cI can walk comfortably to places,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mother doesn\u2019t have to worry about me being stolen anymore.\u201d",
      "The Yousafzai family\u2019s saga with the Americans started in 2007, when Zar Mohammad, the youngest and most educated of six brothers, applied for a job with the U.S. military. The money was good, and the family believed in the American mission to root out extremists and develop their homeland.",
      "Then 30, he traveled from his home in Jalalabad to Kabul, where he easily passed oral and written exams demonstrating his English proficiency.",
      "Soon, he was attached to U.S. Army units in Kandahar, a hotbed of Taliban activity, and Zabul Province, where the Taliban enjoyed support among many villagers and reaped financial rewards from cultivating opium.",
      "Mr. Yousafzai won accolades for his performance and helped three brothers, three nephews and a brother-in-law secure jobs on bases. With the salary he earned, he was able to build a two-story section for his family in the extended-family compound.",
      "Maj. Austin Bird, who commanded the Army engineer company at the base, appointed him chief interpreter. Together, they taught Afghan military personnel how to use and maintain equipment, like bulldozers and backhoes.",
      "Mr. Yousafzai went on combat missions with Major Bird\u2019s soldiers in several provinces, and they came under fire on and off the base.",
      "But there were light moments too, and a friendship blossomed.",
      "\u201cI remember celebrating the birth of his fourth child\u201d in 2012, Major Bird said in an interview. \u201cWe discussed the joys of fatherhood over tea. Zar and I talked about how great it was to be a father and the unique joys of having both boys and girls.\u201d",
      "Sometime in 2011, Mr. Yousafzai was notified by American intelligence personnel that he was being targeted by insurgents. He should vary his travel routes back and forth to the base and try to disguise himself, they advised.",
      "He remained devoted to his work but became increasingly uneasy. He decided to apply for a special immigrant visa to relocate to the United States.",
      "\u201cWhen you went home, everybody knew you worked for the Americans,\u201d Mr. Yousafzai recalled.",
      "His world became smaller. He avoided leaving home, except to go to work.",
      "\u201cQuit your job,\u201d said one of the texts he received. \u201cWe can see you. You are teaching the infidels.\u201d",
      "In 2012, his eldest son, Abrar, then 6, was on his way home alone from a nearby mosque when a car approached with three men inside. The men called out to him, and when he backed away, one of them stepped out and tried to snatch him. He managed to escape.",
      "Threats against Mr. Yousafzai intensified. He was blamed by members of the community for the killing of a village elder by American commandoes.",
      "In 2015, he quit his job with the military and moved to Kabul, where he took a position with the government as an audit manager, putting his accounting degree to use.",
      "But his troubles were not over. As he was riding back to Kabul from Jalalabad, where his family had remained for a time, insurgents sprayed his car with gunfire. He emerged unscathed.",
      "In 2017, Huzzaif was kidnapped while walking home from school with two friends. Days went by without any news.",
      "Then a caller with an unidentified number demanded $200,000 to release the child alive. On the phone, Mr. Yousafzai could hear Huzzaif being whipped. The boy cried, begging his father to pay the ransom.",
      "Mr. Yousafzai told the caller that he had $10,000. \u201cYou are an asset of the Americans,\u201d the voice said.",
      "He scrambled to gather as much money as he could, borrowing from family and friends, providing few details to his wife about their child, who was being shackled and beaten. The kidnappers set impossible deadlines \u2014 five days, three days \u2014 until they finally accepted $40,000.",
      "Huzzaif, who had been born with a heart defect, returned home even more frail. He woke up screaming at night.",
      "Mr. Yousafzai moved his family to Kabul.",
      "In 2019, to his dismay, the American authorities denied his application for a special immigrant visa. He immediately filed an appeal and reached out to Major Bird for help.",
      "\u201cWhy they denied him, I never got a clear answer,\u201d Major Bird, who had written several recommendation letters for Mr. Yousafzai over the years, recalled.",
      "By the time he was notified by consular officials that his application had been approved, in August last year, he had been trying to get a visa for nine years. Still, the process stalled. The coronavirus, which had caused embassy closures, brought consular operations to a standstill.",
      "One night last year as they were waiting, when everyone was fast asleep, a car bomb exploded outside their house in Kabul. Shrapnel struck heads, knees, arms and chins. The children can still roll up sleeves and pants legs to show scars.",
      "\u201cI was just desperate to get to America,\u201d Mrs. Yousafzai said.",
      "In late July, shortly after Mr. Biden pledged that he would expedite the departure of U.S. allies, Mr. Yousafzai received an email from the U.S. Embassy informing him that he could board a relocation flight to the United States.",
      "On Aug. 12, after Mr. Yousafzai and his wife had tested negative for the coronavirus and every family member had passed a medical exam, the family was notified that they had been booked on an evacuation flight leaving Kabul on Aug. 14.",
      "They sold their appliances, mattresses and furniture as quickly as they could, telling people outside their immediate circles that they were moving to India. Mr. Yousafzai scribbled a resignation letter, which he asked a colleague to deliver.",
      "On the appointed day, the family drove to the airport and boarded the military plane, carrying 10 bags loaded with their possessions, including two valuable rugs.",
      "After the processing at Fort Lee in Virginia, they flew to Houston, where Y.M.C.A. International Services, a resettlement agency, received them. On Tuesday, they moved into their apartment \u2014 half a world away from everything that had come before.",
      "Neighbors stopped by to say hello and to teach Mrs. Yousafzai how to use the electric stove, so she could bake the naan dough that she had kneaded.",
      "Volunteers from Houston Welcomes Refugees showed up with boxes of items to furnish the family\u2019s new home. The children gleefully retrieved robots, cars and other toys. As the beds were being set up, Melad, 6, and Murtaza, 2, bounced on the mattresses.",
      "Mrs. Yousafzai hugged the iron; she admired the crockery, glasses and porcelain bowls as she unwrapped them. \u201cOne day I will speak English and talk to you guys,\u201d she said through her husband.",
      "A text popped on Mr. Yousafzai\u2019s phone from Major Bird, asking for the Yousafzai children\u2019s clothing sizes. He planned to visit on Labor Day weekend with his family.",
      "By Thursday, five Yousafzai children were starting school \u2014 close enough to walk, which was fortunate, because the family has no car.",
      "Yet within days of arriving, Mr. Yousafzai was facing a quintessential American problem as he juggled drop-offs at three schools with getting to appointments. \u201cI am having time-management challenges,\u201d he said ruefully.",
      "On their first outing to a Walmart, everyone was bewildered by the wide selection of products and the size of the store.",
      "\u201cAmerica does have everything,\u201d Mrs. Yousafzai said as she scanned the aisles.",
      "In addition to basic household supplies, the couple filled the cart with bananas, pears, plums and honey cake. In the cookie aisle, they tossed in a pack of vanilla Oreos.",
      "Their first American shopping spree set them back $82.43, which Mr. Yousafzai paid in cash.",
      "On the way home, he muttered that he needed to find a job very soon."

      "Mr. Biden made an unannounced flight to Delaware for a rare presidential appearance at a transfer of remains of service members killed overseas. They were on their way from Afghanistan, via Kuwait and Germany, to final rest in communities across the nation that have supplied sons and daughters to fight two decades of what was once called the war on terror.",
      "The transfers began in the late morning and stretched nearly 40 minutes, finishing after noon. Time and again, service members in varying shades of green fatigues carried flag-draped transfer cases down the ramp of the transport, which faced Air Force One on the runway. First came the Army, then the Marines, then the Navy. The carry teams, as they are called, worked in three-minute cycles, marching before a host of dignitaries including the president, the secretaries of state and defense, and several top military brass. They carried the remains from the transport and lifted them through the back cargo doors of four gray vans.",
      "The president stood with his hand over his heart as they passed by. When sets of Marines returned to the belly of the C-17, hands empty, to retrieve the next set of remains, Mr. Biden widened his stance and clasped his hands by his belt or behind his back. Often he bowed his head with his eyes squeezed shut, as if in prayer.",
      "Across from him sat rows of family members of the fallen, so many of them that the Dover base could not house them all in its rooms built specially for next of kin.",
      "The fallen service members returning Sunday to Dover were Marine Corps Staff Sgt. Darin T. Hoover, 31, of Salt Lake City; Marine Corps Sgt. Johanny Rosario Pichardo, 25, of Lawrence, Mass.; Marine Corps Sgt. Nicole L. Gee, 23, of Sacramento, Calif.; Marine Corps Cpl. Hunter Lopez, 22, of Indio, Calif.; Marine Corps Cpl. Daegan W.

Kareem M. Nikoui, 20, of Norco, Calif.; Navy Hospitalman Maxton W. Soviak, 22, of Berlin Heights, Ohio; and Army Staff Sgt. Ryan C. Knauss, 23, of Corryton, Tenn.",
      "The president and the first lady, Jill Biden, met with the families of those service members midmorning on Sunday. They then participated in 13 transfers \u2014 11 for families who chose to allow the news media to observe the remains of their loved ones returning home, and two for families who chose to keep their transfers private.",
      "Mr. Biden\u2019s relationship with the war has been complicated for two decades, and it was complicated on Sunday. As he prepared to meet with the families, military officials confirmed an American drone strike in Kabul. A Defense Department official said the strike had eliminated an \u201cimminent\u201d threat to the airport that was bombed last week. A spokesman for the Taliban, which has taken over the country as U.S. troops leave, said civilians had been killed. Mr. Biden did not speak to reporters about the strike or any other part of the trip, and he declined on Sunday afternoon to answer a question about security at the Kabul airport.",
      "As a senator from Delaware in 2001, Mr. Biden voted to authorize President George W. Bush to start the war after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. After assuming the presidency this year, Mr. Biden announced his plans to remove all American troops from the country by the 20th anniversary of those attacks. In between, nearly 2,500 American troops died in the war.",
      "Reporters were not allowed to observe the transfers in the early years of the war, under Mr. Bush. Newly elected President Barack Obama, who had chosen Mr. Biden as his vice president, changed the policy in 2009 to allow news media access if families consented. His administration also began offering immediate family members transportation to witness the transfers. Since the change, Air Force officials say, more than 10,000 family members have made the trip to Dover to see a loved one\u2019s remains return to American soil.",
      "Presidents rarely attend the transfers. Mr. Obama went twice, in 2009 and 2011. President Donald J. Trump went four times, once bringing the actor Jon Voight with him. Mr. Biden went once as vice president in 2016. Sunday was his first opportunity as president; these were the first American service members killed in combat abroad since he took office.",
      "Mr. Biden has said he hopes to have all American troops out of Afghanistan by Tuesday, and that the deadline remains on track. On Sunday, the U.S. military was shifting its focus from vetting and airlifting Afghan and American civilians to bringing its personnel home.",
      "In Dover, the fallen service members captured the complete attention of the president and his traveling entourage, which included three federal government planes that matched the coloring of Air Force One. As the carry teams worked, the only sounds were the hum of a far-off engine and the \u201chup-hup\u201d of the teams marching slowly in time, along with a few anguished cries from the family members who were shielded from reporters by a large bus. At one point in the humid weather, one of the onlookers, the wife of Senator Thomas R. Carper of Delaware, appeared to collapse and was rushed to medical attention by a team of other bystanders. The carry teams did not pause their work.",
      "Mr. Biden\u2019s lone public reflection on the day came hours later, in midafternoon remarks to workers at the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Washington who were bracing to help the Gulf Coast withstand Hurricane Ida.",
      "Before addressing the storm, the president told the workers he had just come from Dover, where he had seen 13 \u201cfallen heroes\u201d come home.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s keep them in our prayers,\u201d he said."

      "A Connecticut woman was sentenced to seven days in jail for walking on the thermal grounds at Yellowstone National Park, an act the authorities described as extremely dangerous.",
      "The woman, Madeline Casey, 26, was sentenced on Aug. 18, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Wyoming. She was charged with traveling in the thermal areas and disorderly conduct, according to court records.",
      "Ms. Casey and two others with her, who were not identified in the statement, made their way to a thermal pool and geyser at Norris Geyser Basin, one of the largest thermal areas at Yellowstone, after they left the marked boardwalk during a visit last month, the authorities said.",
      "Worried onlookers took photos and videos of the three people as they walked over the thermal ground, the statement said.",
      "\u201cThe ground is fragile and thin, and scalding water just below the surface can cause severe or fatal burns,\u201d said Morgan Warthin, a Yellowstone National Park spokeswoman. \u201cMore than 20 people have died from burns suffered after they entered or fell into Yellowstone\u2019s hot springs.\u201d",
      "The authorities said the park does a \u201cdarn good job\u201d of warning people to stay on the boardwalk and trails in thermal areas and educating them about the unstable ground, boiling water and scalding mud.",
      "\u201cYet there will always be those like Ms. Casey who don\u2019t get it,\u201d Bob Murray, the acting U.S. attorney, said in the statement. \u201cAlthough a criminal prosecution and jail time may seem harsh, it\u2019s better than spending time in a hospital\u2019s burn unit.\u201d",
      "A woman visited Yellowstone last year while it was closed because of the pandemic and sustained serious burns when she fell into a hot spring or a steam vent while she was taking photos, The Associated Press reported.",
      "The park\u2019s thermal features include hot springs, geysers, steam vents and mud pots. Last fall, The A.P. reported, a man walking off a boardwalk fell into a hot spring and also sustained serious burns. In 2016, a 23-year-old man fell into an acidic mud pot and died.",
      "A man who was cited for walking in a thermal area around the same time as Ms. Casey, and whose fine was later dismissed, said on Friday that he hadn\u2019t seen the signs warning people not to enter the thermal area because they were too low to the ground.",
      "\u201cI just wanted to see where the steam was rising and get a picture,\u201d said the man, Floyd K. Parham. \u201cOnce I got the picture, I went back to my truck, but they said I had passed through the thermal area.\u201d",
      "According to the National Park Service website, the Norris Geyser Basin is the hottest and oldest of Yellowstone\u2019s thermal areas. Evidence suggests that Norris has had thermal features for at least 115,000 years, and very few of them are below the boiling point of water.",
      "A lawyer for Ms. Casey, Ryan Wright, declined to comment on Friday. A message left for Ms. Casey through her lawyer was not returned on Friday.",
      "In addition to the jail time, Ms. Casey was ordered to pay a $1,000 fine, a $1,000 community service payment to the Yellowstone Forever Geological Resource Fund, and $40 in fees.",
      "It was not immediately clear why Ms. Casey had been singled out in the statement by federal prosecutors. It was also unclear whether charges had been filed against the two others who were with her.",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it was ever going to be easy to leave,\u201d Ms. Ortiz said while watching her children play soccer in their recently resumed league at a park in the Los Angeles County community of Hacienda Heights. \u201cAt the end of the day, our country is where we need to be focusing. We have our own issues: getting the kids to school, healing our communities. It\u2019s not our war to fight anymore.\u201d",
      "At a time of deep partisan division, in a Southern California congressional district where Democrats narrowly outnumber Republicans, voters interviewed over the weekend were largely united on at least one issue: After a two-decade war, President Biden was right to pull American troops out of Afghanistan.",
      "The bombing at the Kabul airport had done little to change their minds, the killing of 13 soldiers leaving them more numbed than saddened. Many said they were simply too overwhelmed to pay close attention to another overseas crisis. \u201cWe have a lot of mending here to do,\u201d said Ms. Ortiz, who considers herself a political moderate and voted for Mr. Biden.",
      "Amid a still-raging pandemic and a still-recovering economy, this was a time to be focused on problems at home rather than abroad, more than a dozen Republican, Democratic and independent voters said in conversations in and around Hacienda Heights, a community of 55,000 people about 20 miles east of downtown Los Angeles where first- and second-generation immigrants fill the subdivisions and strip malls.",
      "Afghanistan could be ignored, they said, but the possibility of their too-young-to-be-vaccinated children getting sick could not. Leaders in Washington might worry about the threat of terrorism or America\u2019s standing with allies, but voters in Hacienda Heights said they were far more concerned about issues affecting them directly: Covid-19, homelessness and climate change, to name a few.",
      "They also seemed hesitant to hold Mr. Biden accountable for last week\u2019s attacks, at least for now.",
      "\u201cWhen you have no good choice, you still have to pick one,\u201d said Patrick Huang, a 65-year-old independent who has voted for both Republicans and Democrats. \u201cThey had plenty of time to prepare to get everybody out, and they totally messed it up. But I don\u2019t blame President Biden for everything. This came after many, many presidents made mistakes.\u201d",
      "Less than a decade ago, California\u2019s 39th Congressional District was reliably Republican. Encompassing the intersection of suburban Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside Counties, it is perhaps best known as Richard Nixon\u2019s birthplace. Today, the district is about evenly divided among Asian American, Latino and white voters and is among the more competitive in the country: Although Mr. Biden won easily, a Republican captured the House seat from an incumbent Democrat in 2020.",
      "Richard Yeung and Emily Chen, who both voted for Mr. Biden last fall, remember the unity that came after the Sept. 11 attacks, when they were teenagers. By the time they were in their mid-20s, they said, they began to question why the United States remained in Afghanistan.",
      "Ms. Chen spoke of the human toll in Afghanistan, but quickly added: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do. My priorities are more domestic \u2014 health and climate, what is that going to look like?\u201d",
      "Even some Republicans who voted for Donald Trump last fall were reluctant to criticize Mr. Biden.",
      "\u201cThey maybe exited more quickly than they should have, but I think it was right to be out,\u201d said Andrew Chang, 40, as he shopped with his wife, Tonya Chang, in downtown Fullerton. \u201cIt was multiple presidents\u2019 missteps. And we couldn\u2019t have stayed there forever.\u201d",
      "Ms. Chang, 32, said she had largely paid attention to what was happening with Afghan women through forums on Reddit.",
      "\u201cHearing what they go through is horrible, there\u2019s no way around that,\u201d she said. But she said her vote was highly unlikely to be swayed over international issues. \u201cI\u2019m much more concerned about what is happening here,\u201d she said. Taxes remained the most important issue for her.",
      "Even Representative Young Kim, a Republican who flipped the seat last year, was less critical of the president than many lawmakers in her party.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have the luxury to be sad about what is happening, but we have to be resolute, gather information and get people to safety,\u201d Ms. Kim said in an interview. \u201cThis is not the time to point fingers, when people are desperate and people are dying.\u201d",
      "But Ms. Kim added that she has heard from constituents who \u201care not satisfied with what they are seeing and hearing from our commander in chief.\u201d",
      "Inja Yun, 76, who voted for Democrats for much of her life until Mr. Trump convinced her she had been \u201cbrainwashed\u201d by liberals, said she did not support anything Mr. Biden has done.",
      "\u201cHe left Americans behind,\u201d Ms. Yun said. \u201cHe left how many people there. He led them to become sacrifices. He is old, and he allowed young people to die. The only thing that makes me optimistic is that Trump is willing to fight back.\u201d",
      "Though many voters seemed to be disengaging emotionally from events in Afghanistan, they seemed inclined nonetheless to see the United States do more to take in Afghan refugees. This month, the Orange County Board of Supervisors voted to call on Mr. Biden to increase the cap on refugees and include an additional 100,000 people from Afghanistan.",
      "Like many voters in the district, L. Quach is the daughter of immigrants. Her mother has frequently drawn parallels between America\u2019s exit from Afghanistan and Vietnam, which she left as a refugee not long after the fall of Saigon.",
      "\u201cPresident Biden was left with a dumpster fire,\u201d Ms. Quach, a Democrat, said of Afghanistan, adding that although she saw the bombing in Kabul as \u201ctragic,\u201d the situation there was \u201cnot a top priority.\u201d",
      "\u201cDomestic policies are far more important and we have to focus on disparities we have here,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m focused on being able to provide for my family.\u201d",
      "Miguel Ruiz Lopez, an Army veteran who was stationed in Germany during Vietnam, said he, too, saw the historical analogy, and history repeating itself.",
      "\u201cIt couldn\u2019t continue,\u201d Mr. Lopez said. \u201cSomebody had to say it\u2019s done. What are we going to do: continue being there and losing people\u2019s lives? That\u2019s their country. You can\u2019t continue fighting a losing battle.\u201d",
      "But one soccer field over from Mr. Lopez, a veteran who served in Afghanistan saw it differently.",
      "Aaron Macareno, 34, who spent 2009 in Afghanistan as a Marine and who considers himself a moderate independent, said he never viewed his service through a political lens. Instead, he said, he thought of himself as there to help villagers who lacked access to clean water or an education.",
      "\u201cI wish we stayed, because there were so many lives lost and so much blood we gave,\u201d he said. Still, he stopped short of criticizing Mr. Biden\u2019s decision. \u201cI don\u2019t feel betrayed, just disappointed. I know I didn\u2019t make a difference to an entire country. My unit didn\u2019t make a difference to an entire country. But we helped people. There\u2019s no regrets about that.\u201d",
      "Like others, Kris Hallun, a 34-year-old independent, said Mr. Biden was dealing with a \u201cno-win situation.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhy should we stay in a no-win war and have another Vietnam indefinitely?\u201d he said. \u201cAll the people who are literally having to run for their lives, it\u2019s just sad. But there\u2019s not much we can do. We need to help each other here, take care of our own.\u201d",
      "Greg O\u2019Neal, 60, said he was a moderate who had voted for Republicans in the past. And on Saturday, he visited the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in nearby Yorba Linda, acting on an impulse that history had judged Nixon too harshly.",
      "During the Trump administration, Mr. O\u2019Neal and his wife, Kim, said they found themselves watching cable news around the clock, wrapped up in anxiety.",
      "\u201cI used to hold my breath every day,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Neal said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that way anymore. There are adults in the room now. I don\u2019t think we know everything, and I am OK with that.\u201d",
      "Besides, she said, it seems very likely that American troops will be forced to descend on the region again. Mr. O\u2019Neal sighed.",
      "\u201cI want my elected officials to focus on us,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve been forgotten about for so long. It\u2019s time we really focus on the United States. We have fires everywhere. This is a moment we need the attention.\u201d"

    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Amid deadly heat waves and new evidence showing that wildfire smoke may contribute to premature births, the Biden administration is creating a new federal office to address the health consequences of climate change and their disproportionate effects on poor communities.",
      "The Office of Climate Change and Health Equity, which the administration announced on Monday, will be the first federal program aimed specifically at understanding how planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels also affect human health. It will fall under the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "It\u2019s an area that medical experts have urged the government to take more seriously, and public health leaders said the new office was long overdue.",
      "\u201cThe health of the American people is falling through the cracks because there hasn\u2019t been a targeted focus on climate risk,\u201d said Aaron Bernstein, interim director of the Center for Climate, Health and the Global Environment at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \u201cThis is the opportunity to plug that hole.\u201d",
      "In 2009, scientists warned in the medical journal The Lancet that global warming would harm crop yields, cause tropical diseases to show up in new parts of the world and lead to water shortages. In 2020, the journal said those threats no longer belonged to the distant future.",
      "\u201cClimate change is fundamentally a health threat,\u201d said Gina McCarthy, the White House national climate change adviser. She said part of the mission of the office would be to encourage doctors to talk to their patients about protecting themselves from things like heat waves, wildfire smoke and other air pollution.",
      "In particular, experts said, more needs to be done to understand how extreme weather affects older people as well as communities of color, where families are more likely to live in areas hardest hit by disasters.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a saying that if white people catch a cold, Black people catch pneumonia,\u201d said Beverly Malone, chief executive of the National League for Nursing. \u201cHealth equity has a lot to do with where you live, and we have understood the linkage.\u201d",
      "President Biden has requested $3 million to fund the climate office next year, a sum that still requires congressional approval. Those setting up the office have been brought in from other agencies drawing on existing funds. John Balbus, the senior adviser to the director of the National Institutes of Health on climate change, will serve as interim director."

    "title": "White House Weighs Clemency to Keep Some Drug Offenders Confined at Home",
    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Biden is considering using his clemency powers to commute the sentences of certain federal drug offenders released to home confinement during the pandemic rather than forcing them to return to prison after the pandemic emergency ends, according to officials familiar with internal deliberations.",
      "The legal and policy discussions about a mass clemency program are focused on nonviolent drug offenders with less than four years remaining in their sentences, the officials said. The contemplated intervention would not apply to those now in home confinement with longer sentences left, or those who committed other types of crimes.",
      "The notion of clemency for some inmates is just one of several ideas being examined in the executive branch and Congress. Others include a broader use of a law that permits the \u201ccompassionate release\u201d of sick or elderly inmates, and Congress enacting a law to allow some inmates to stay in home confinement after the pandemic.",
      "Interviews with officials in both the executive branch and Congress, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive deliberations, suggest there is broad support for letting nonviolent inmates who have obeyed the rules stay at home \u2014 reducing incarceration and its cost to taxpayers. But officials in each branch also foresee major challenges and have hoped the other would solve the problem.",
      "The issue traces back to 2020, when Congress included a provision in a Covid-19 relief law that empowered the Bureau of Prisons to release thousands of nonviolent federal inmates to home confinement. The idea was to reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus in crowded settings. Since then, advocates for the inmates have denounced the prospect of eventually sending them back.",
      "But a Trump-era memo by the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel said that after the pandemic emergency period ends, the bureau\u2019s legal authority to keep such inmates in home confinement would \u201cevaporate\u201d if they were not by then close enough to the end of their sentences to be eligible for such treatment in normal times.",
      "That will not be soon: With the Delta variant spurring a surge in cases, the public health emergency is not expected to end before next year at the earliest. But under normal circumstances, the law permits the authorities to allow home confinement only for inmates in the final six months or 10 percent of their sentence.",
      "As many as 2,000 sent home during the pandemic may fall outside that limit.",
      "Inmate advocates and some Democratic lawmakers have urged the Biden legal team to rescind the Trump-era memo and assert that the bureau can lawfully keep the prisoners in home confinement even after the pandemic ends.",
      "But The New York Times reported last month that the Biden legal team had concluded that the memo\u2019s interpretation of the law was correct, according to officials briefed on the internal deliberations. Officials have subsequently characterized that scrutiny as a preliminary review and said that a more formal one was underway, but suggested that a reversal of the Trump-era legal interpretation continued to be highly unlikely.",
      "Against that backdrop, in a little-noticed comment at a press briefing this month, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, let slip that Mr. Biden was taking a closer look at clemency to help the subgroup who are nonviolent drug offenders.",
      "\u201cHe is therefore exploring multiple avenues to provide relief to nonviolent drug offenders, including through the use of his clemency power,\u201d Ms. Psaki said.",
      "In interviews, officials have subsequently confirmed that focus. As a first step, the Justice Department will soon begin requesting clemency petitions for drug offenders who have less than four years left on their sentence, which will then be reviewed by its pardon office, they said.",
      "It is unclear whether the Biden team is leaning toward commuting the sentences of the nonviolent drug offenders to home confinement, reducing the length of their sentences to bring them within the normal window for home confinement or a mix of the two.",
      "The officials said focusing on nonviolent drug offenders, as opposed to other types of criminals, dovetailed with Mr. Biden\u2019s area of comfort on matters of criminal justice reform. In his campaign platform, Mr. Biden had said he pledged to end prison time for drug use alone and instead divert offenders to drug courts and treatment.",
      "Inimai Chettiar, the federal director of the Justice Action Network, called the idea a good start but also questioned the basis for limiting it to some nonviolent drug offenders, saying there was \u201cno scientific evidence\u201d for restricting the help to that category. She suggested another explanation. \u201cPolitically, it\u2019s an easier group to start with,\u201d Ms. Chettiar said.",
      "In addition, officials said, the Justice Department is studying other options that could help keep different groups from being forced back into prison. Another idea under consideration is to petition the courts to let some individual inmates stay in home confinement under a \u201ccompassionate release\u201d law.",
      "While the compassionate release law is normally used to permit terminally ill inmates to rejoin their families shortly before dying, the statute includes a broad standard for what a judge could decide warrants a sentence reduction \u2014 \u201cextraordinary and compelling reasons\u201d \u2014 that is not defined and might be applied to the pandemic-era home confinement population.",
      "Kristie Breshears, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Prisons, said additional options included expanding a pilot program that allows for the early release of older inmates in order to keep some who are over the ago of 60 in home confinement, and placing some inmates in halfway houses for 12 months.",
      "Separately, Senators Richard J. Durbin of Illinois and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa \u2014 the top Democrat and Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee \u2014 have also been discussing potential bipartisan legislation that would solve the problem in a simpler way by explicitly authorizing the Justice Department to extend home confinement after the pandemic.",
      "At a hearing in April, Mr. Grassley joined Democrats in voicing support for allowing inmates in home confinement to stay there. Taylor Foy, a spokesman for Mr. Grassley, said his office had drafted legislation that month that would let \u201cinmates moved to home confinement during the pandemic complete their sentences there rather than returning to prison after the pandemic ends.\u201d",
      "Mr. Durbin had been among those who urged the Biden administration to instead reinterpret existing law as permitting perpetual home confinement for those inmates who were placed there during the emergency period. In a statement, Mr. Durbin embraced the idea of new legislation, but also said he did not think it would be easy \u2014 or necessary.",
      "The prospects for legislation in \u201can evenly divided Senate are uncertain,\u201d he said, reiterating his view that \u201cthe Biden administration has ample executive authority to immediately provide the certainty\u201d to the inmates."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Biden on Friday used his first meeting with Prime Minister Naftali Bennett of Israel to underscore that working closely with a longstanding ally in the Middle East was still a focus of his administration, even as the crisis in Afghanistan has opened him up to criticism that he is ceding ground in the wider region to extremists.",
      "The meeting, originally scheduled for Thursday but delayed a day because of the deadly terrorist bombing at the airport in Kabul that killed 13 U.S. service members, also offered Mr. Biden a brief break from the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and the opportunity to project the confidence of a president consulting with a supportive foreign ally.",
      "\u201cI look forward to us establishing a strong personal relationship,\u201d Mr. Biden said, sitting in the Oval Office next to Mr. Bennett. He said the focus of the meeting was to demonstrate \u201can unshakable partnership between our two nations.\u201d Both men wore masks.",
      "The two leaders have significant policy differences. In an interview with The New York Times several days before Friday\u2019s meeting, Mr. Bennett said he would oppose American-led attempts to reinstate a lapsed nuclear agreement with Iran and would expand West Bank settlements that Mr. Biden opposes.",
      "Mr. Biden said Friday that they planned to discuss America\u2019s commitment to ensuring that Iran never develops a nuclear weapon.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re putting diplomacy first and seeing where that takes us,\u201d he said. \u201cIf diplomacy fails, we\u2019re ready to turn to other options.\u201d",
      "The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, reiterated Friday that diplomacy was the best option.",
      "Despite their differences on policy, both leaders were eager for a reset in relations between their countries and to reinforce a bond that has showed signs of strain.",
      "Mr. Biden tried to underscore points of connection. \u201cWe\u2019ve become close friends,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s ridden the Amtrak train a lot,\u201d added the president, whose own estimated 8,000 round trips on the line earned him the nickname \u201cAmtrak Joe.\u201d Mr. Biden also noted that he had worked closely with every Israeli prime minister since Golda Meir.",
      "Mr. Bennett arrived at the White House on Friday eager to solidify his place on the world stage and emphasize that his long-serving predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu, was not irreplaceable. The visit was also an opportunity to make good on his campaign promise that Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s style of direct confrontation with Democrats was not in Israel\u2019s interest.",
      "\u201cI bring with me a new spirit,\u201d he said. \u201cA spirit of good will, a spirit of hope, decency and honesty, a spirit of unity and bipartisanship.\u201d",
      "Mr. Bennett\u2019s new diverse, coalition government, which includes parties that support Palestinian statehood and others opposed, is a powerful example of the kind of democratic norms Mr. Biden has vowed to strengthen, both at home and abroad. The meeting was also an opportunity for him to strengthen Mr. Bennett.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s Biden\u2019s guy,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East negotiator and adviser in Republican and Democratic administrations. \u201cHe has offered him a huge respite from what would have been Netanyahu\u2019s highly partisan, politicized courting of Republicans, who would have been only too happy to play along.\u201d",
      "Mr. Miller added that whatever policy differences divided the two leaders, Mr. Biden has a \u201cmuch stronger incentive in ensuring Bennett survives and Netanyahu doesn\u2019t come back into power.\u201d",
      "The meeting was unusual in that it fell in the middle of the worst foreign policy crisis of Mr. Biden\u2019s presidency so far and may have served as a reminder that Israel would be far down on the list of Mr. Biden\u2019s priorities in the months and years to come. Still, as Mr. Biden learned in the early months of his presidency when the worst fighting between Israelis and Palestinians in seven years broke out, crises in the Middle East are hard to avoid.",
      "\u201cWith any American president, you have to be able to show you can walk and chew gum at the same time,\u201d said Lucy Kurtzer-Ellenbogen, the director of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict program at the United States Institute of Peace. \u201cA lot of the criticism about Afghanistan is that it\u2019s an abandonment of traditional U.S. allies. This was an opportunity to sit with a longstanding, steadfast ally and say this is still a focus and we will work side by side.\u201d"

    "content": [
      "\u2014 New York Times article about military child care from 1975",
      "In Her Words is available as a newsletter. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox.",
      "In 1978, Linda Smith walked into her new job as program director of the child care center at Williams Air Force Base in Arizona to find a distressing sight: dozens of toddlers and infants all crammed into one room with a single caregiver and a TV mounted on the wall.",
      "\u201cThey were all just running around the room, and there was just one chair \u2014 for the caregiver,\u201d Ms. Smith said. \u201cImagine the chaos.\u201d",
      "The scene Ms. Smith witnessed was actually quite common in a child care system that was then deeply underfunded and riddled with scandal. At the time, most military child care centers did not even meet fire and safety codes, according to a scathing report published in 1982 by the General Accounting Office, the congressional watchdog.",
      "The tipping point came in 1987, when the U.S. Army closed a child care center at the Presidio base in San Francisco amid reports of children being sexually abused.",
      "In the ensuing years, the Defense Department, with the help of Ms. Smith, would engineer a transformation of its child care system, laying the groundwork for the creation of what is widely considered among the best such programs in the country.",
      "Today, the system\u2019s standards are considered more rigorous than any state\u2019s and almost all of its centers meet the criteria for national accreditation, which includes having a vetted curriculum and a low student-teacher ratio. By comparison, less than one in 10 civilian programs are accredited.",
      "Because child care is considered essential to \u201cmilitary readiness,\u201d the Defense Department spends over $1 billion a year, funding everything from upkeep of centers to subsidizing parent fees to the employment of 23,000 child care workers, many of whom are specifically trained by the military for early education, and are paid more than their civilian counterparts.",
      "The model is one that researchers, advocates and lawmakers \u2014 most notably Senator Elizabeth Warren and the co-sponsors of her expansive universal child care bill, including Senator Cory Booker, and Representatives Mondaire Jones and James McGovern \u2014 urge the rest of the country to emulate.",
      "Last week, the House passed a $3.5 trillion blueprint, paving the way for Congress to draft legislation that would expand the social safety net, although its ultimate shape remains to be worked out in the coming days through a quirky process called reconciliation. It\u2019s unlikely that the package will go as far as replicating the military\u2019s turnaround at a national scale and may instead create a universal prekindergarten system.",
      "But the experience of the military provides crucial lessons. Before its transformation, the military child care system was plagued by many of the same problems that plague America\u2019s national child care system today: no clear teaching standards, inconsistent quality and low teacher pay, said Lynette Fraga, chief executive of Child Care Aware of America, a national child care advocacy organization.",
      "\u201cTaking the lessons they\u2019ve learned,\u201d Ms. Fraga said, \u201ccould be incredibly important to reimagining the civilian system.\u201d",
      "The story of how the Defense Department transformed its child care services is inextricable from the military\u2019s broader changes in the 1970s. In 1973, the military ended the compulsory draft that started before World War II, switching to an all-volunteer armed force.",
      "Without a draft, and in the shadow of the unpopular Vietnam War, the military found itself having to attract and retain talent \u2014 a situation that catalyzed the creation of a raft of new policies in the coming years.",
      "One change was the 1975 decision to allow pregnant women to keep their jobs. Until that point, military women \u2014 nearly all of whom held noncombat roles at the time \u2014 were automatically discharged if they became pregnant, unless special exceptions were granted. The change in policy quickly led to a surge in marriages and babies. By 1986, on one base \u2014 Hampton Roads, in Virginia, which housed 100,000 employees and their families \u2014 400 babies were born each month, according to a New York Times article published that year.",
      "Informal care arrangements started sprouting up all over. Young parents would sometimes ask commanders to help look after their children, The Times wrote. \u201cSome commanders grumble that they are warriors, not babysitters.\u201d",
      "Parents who were called for drills in the middle of the night would often bring their groggy children, still wearing pajamas, and leave them alone in their cars while they worked, Ms. Smith recalled.",
      "On many bases, parents created ad hoc \u201cnurseries\u201d and hired temporary caregivers who would be on call on an hourly basis. The fees parents were charged were so low, they would barely cover staff wages and there was little money left to invest in upgrading the nursery.",
      "One of the first things Ms. Smith did when she arrived at the child care center in Arizona was hire permanent staff members and move them onto the government\u2019s payroll.",
      "Then she tapped a local community college to provide her staff with formal training. The training was paid for by the military as well, and wage increases were tied to a worker\u2019s level of qualifications. Slowly, these changes began to improve staff retention rates and the quality of care.",
      "The center became fully woven into the functioning of the base. \u201cWhen they did drills in the middle of the night, I\u2019d get a call from the base commander saying, \u2018Come open the child care center because my men and women can\u2019t come unless you do that,\u2019\u201d Ms. Smith said.",
      "Ms. Smith would go on to replicate her model at over a dozen other U.S. bases around the world.",
      "But at a majority of bases, quality was still lagging and Congress was under increasing pressure to fix the problem.",
      "In 1989, after consulting with Ms. Smith and the Defense Department, lawmakers passed the Military Child Care Act, mandating that the department fund child care programs and staff training. The law also increased wages for caregivers, kept fees for parents low and enforced safety standards.",
      "Accountability \u2014 things like regular facility inspections \u2014 fell under the control of the Defense Department, not states, because otherwise \u201cwe would never have had consistency,\u201d Ms. Smith said.",
      "The military also  had the authority to close centers that didn\u2019t meet its standards. \u201cWe had to report to Congress when any center was closed, and no base commander wanted to be reported to Congress that his facility didn\u2019t meet specific standards,\u201d said Ms. Smith, who now works as the director of the early childhood initiative at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank.",
      "Today, about 97 percent of the child care centers run by the Defense Department on bases and in certified home-based facilities are nationally accredited, compared with 9 percent of civilian centers nationwide, according to a 2020 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. An unaccredited center can still be licensed by state or local governments after meeting basic health and safety standards, which vary from state to state but generally involve things like class sizes, staff background checks and building safety. To become accredited, a center must meet a set of higher standards focused on the quality of the teaching program.",
      "\u201cThink of all child care systems as a three-legged stool between access, affordability and quality, and if you focus on just one leg, the other two fall off,\u201d said Rhian Evans Allvin, chief executive of the National Association for the Education of Young Children.",
      "With the military system, \u201cthey\u2019ve been able to keep all the legs of the stool on,\u201d Ms. Allvin said.",
      "Military families can log onto a centralized website to enroll children of all ages. Fees are determined by a sliding scale based on total family income. In 2019, they ranged from about $3,000 to $8,400 a year per child.",
      "By comparison, the national average fee for full-time civilian child care in 2017 was $10,000 a year, according to a Moody\u2019s analysis, and can go up to $20,000 in Massachusetts.",
      "Families in the military do, however, face long waiting lists that can often stretch into years, said Nicole Russell, government relations deputy director at the National Military Family Association, an advocacy group. Ms. Russell herself is on a child care waiting list in Northern Virginia. To try to address the short supply, the Defense Department has partnerships with a network of accredited civilian centers and offers subsidies to help pay the higher fees.",
      "Caregivers at military centers can earn $12 to $15 an hour with benefits, while nationally, child care workers are paid a little over $11, often with no benefits. This ranks the industry among the lowest paid in the country, with high rates of poverty, according to a recent report by a research institute at the University of California, Berkeley.",
      "Of the several child care plans that Congress was considering this year, Senator Warren\u2019s $700 billion bill was among the most ambitious and sweeping. It proposed using federal dollars to back providers in order to make child care accessible for children from birth to age 5 regardless of household income or parent employment status. It would also have required all child care providers to be accredited, established a sliding scale for fees and boosted wages for workers.",
      "A lot of Senator Warren\u2019s ideas came from the military model, said Jon Donenberg, her current chief of staff, noting the system\u2019s universality. It doesn\u2019t matter what a service member is earning or if they\u2019re in the middle of transitioning jobs: Their toddlers and infants stand to receive affordable, high-quality care.",
      "What is known so far of the $3.2 trillion budget blueprint now working its way through the reconciliation process is that it will most likely establish a pared-back vision for child care that may include universal prekindergarten for 3- and 4-year-olds. Negotiations during the legislative process \u2014 which would require support from all 50 Democrats in the Senate and the majority in the House \u2014 might also shrink the overall spending figure to appease the more conservative arm of the party.",
      "And Ms. Smith noted that there also aren\u2019t many details yet on how exactly the federal government would help providers improve quality and work force recruitment and training.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the missing piece right now,\u201d she said. \u201cThe money going to the programs is what made a lot of the changes happen in the military. And I worry, as we go through reconciliation, that we as a country still haven\u2019t learned that.\u201d"

    "title": "Texas G.O.P. Passes Election Bill, Raising Voting Barriers Even Higher",
    "content": [
      "HOUSTON \u2014 The Republican-controlled Texas Legislature on Tuesday passed a major bill overhauling the state\u2019s elections, overcoming a six-week walkout by Democrats to cement Texas as one of the most difficult states in the country in which to vote.",
      "The voting restrictions were a capstone victory in Republicans\u2019 national push to tighten voting rules and alter the administration of elections in the wake of false claims about the integrity of the 2020 presidential contest. Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, vowed on Tuesday to sign the bill.",
      "The legislation takes aim in particular at Harris County, a growing Democratic bastion that includes Houston and is the nation\u2019s third most populous county. The legislation forbids balloting methods that the county introduced last year to make voting easier during the pandemic, including drive-through polling places and 24-hour voting, as well as temporary voting locations.",
      "It also bars election officials from sending voters unsolicited absentee ballot applications and from promoting the use of vote by mail. The bill greatly empowers partisan poll watchers, creates new criminal and civil penalties for poll workers and erects new barriers for those looking to help voters who need assistance, such as with translations. It requires large Texas counties \u2014 where Democrats perform better \u2014 to provide livestreaming video at ballot-counting locations.",
      "Including Texas, 18 states across the country have passed more than 30 bills this year restricting voting, one of the greatest contractions of access to the ballot since the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965. The relentless pace of these voting laws has raised pressure on Democrats in Congress, where a stalemate in a narrowly divided Senate has left them with little hope of passing federal voting legislation that would combat the new restrictions.",
      "Texas, a state with booming urban areas and demographic trends that have long been seen as favoring Democrats, already had some of the nation\u2019s tallest barriers to casting a ballot. It has closed hundreds of polling locations since the Supreme Court invalidated a key part of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, according to a report by the nonpartisan Leadership Conference Education Fund. The state has one of the strictest voter identification laws in the country and does not permit no-excuse absentee voting by mail for voters younger than 65.",
      "Democrats, voting rights groups and civil rights leaders had furiously opposed the Texas bill, called Senate Bill 1, arguing that its impact would fall disproportionately on Black and Latino voters. To delay passage, more than 50 Democratic members of the State House fled the state for Washington in July, denying Republicans the necessary numbers to hold a vote. The move drew national attention and support from President Biden and Senate Democrats, whom the Texas lawmakers urged to pass federal legislation protecting voting rights.",
      "\u201cWe knew we wouldn\u2019t be able to hold off this day forever,\u201d Representative Chris Turner, the chairman of the House Democratic caucus, said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cNow that it has come, we need the U.S. Senate to act immediately.\u201d",
      "As the legislation headed to the governor\u2019s desk to become law, civic and voting rights groups were already preparing lawsuits to its many provisions.",
      "\u201cI tell Republicans all the time, \u2018You may have the votes, but we\u2019re all equal in federal court, so don\u2019t delete any emails,\u2019\u201d said State Representative Trey Martinez Fischer, a Democrat who organized the effort to leave the state. \u201cAnd I think that that\u2019s where we are.\u201d  ",
      "State Senator Bryan Hughes, the Republican author of the legislation, called the measure \u201ca bill that we can be proud of,\u201d in a speech on the chamber floor in Austin on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cHow much fraud is OK?\u201d Mr. Hughes asked. \u201cNone. How much suppression is OK? None. That\u2019s why Senate Bill 1 makes it easier to vote and harder to cheat.\u201d",
      "Republicans in Texas have argued that the legislation was necessary to create confidence in the election system and address the possibility of fraud by voters. Throughout the debates in both the House and the Senate, Republican lawmakers pointed to discrete episodes of what they described as improper and fraudulent voting, though not the sort of systematic voter fraud that could have shifted election results. They strongly denied that the bill would disproportionately hurt Black and Hispanic voters, but blocked Democratic efforts to make studying the bill\u2019s impact on voters of color a part of the legislation.",
      "\u201cIt is about ensuring that all Texans trust the outcome of every election in Texas,\u201d Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a Republican who presides over the Texas Senate, said in a statement.",
      "The voting bill is not the only conservative measure being considered in the Texas capital. The ongoing special session, which followed a notably conservative regular legislative session earlier this year, contains a raft of proposed legislation that is possibly even more contentious.",
      "The list of bills \u2014 revived by Mr. Abbott, who faces re-election next year and, for the first time in his 25-year career in elected office, serious primary challenges from fellow Republicans \u2014 features priorities of the G.O.P.\u2019s most staunch supporters. The measures include more money for a wall along the border with Mexico, stricter rules on how Texas schools teach about race, bans on receiving abortion drugs by mail and restrictions on transgender athletes in competitions.",
      "The Legislature is also weighing a measure to pre-empt local worker protection ordinances, an effort that would deepen the battle lines between the Republican-dominated state government and Democratic officials in Texas cities.",
      "The passage of the election bill came after an unusually bitter and unpredictable several months in the Texas Capitol.",
      "After the Democratic House members left the state, Mr. Abbott called two special sessions, one after the other. The Republican speaker of the House, Dade Phelan, issued civil warrants for the lawmakers\u2019 arrest. Democrats took refuge first outside Texas and then, when some returned, furtively within their homes or in \u201cundisclosed locations\u201d in the state.",
      "Over time, attention waned and many Democrats wavered. The first 30-day special session expired in early August without any vote. The second one started immediately after and Democrats hunkered down, mostly in Texas, meeting daily via videoconference to try to hold their ranks together. Some trickled in, but not enough to allow Republicans to hold a vote.",
      "Then, on Aug. 19, three Democratic members from Houston surprised their colleagues by showing up together on the House floor at the State Capitol. The move paved the way for Republicans to establish a quorum, and set off a round of finger-pointing and backbiting among Democrats in the state.",
      "That the bill had been delayed as long as it had \u2014 the walkout lasted 38 days in all \u2014 surprised many in Austin. It raised the national profiles of the Democrats who took to Washington to call for federal voting rights legislation, their only real hope of countering the Republican measures in Texas.",
      "Some Republican members of the Legislature called on Texas citizens and others to help track down the absent Democrats. And outside groups offered money \u2014 as much as $2,500 in one case \u2014 for information leading to the Democrats, worrying those members that some vigilante might take the law into his or her own hands.",
      "In the end, Republican leaders in the state opted to wait out their Democratic colleagues rather than making arrests \u2014 as some more fiery lawmakers called for \u2014 to establish a quorum.",
      "The walkout ended as others have in Texas over the years, with Democrats returning to Austin to watch as bills they vociferously opposed passed the Legislature with little of their input.",
      "On Friday, the House passed the bill on a nearly party-line vote of 80 to 41. The Senate had previously passed its version of the bill, but because the House made some revisions to the Senate bill, it was sent back to the Senate for the author of the bill, Mr. Hughes, to concur.",
      "Mr. Hughes agreed to all of the changes but one: He opposed a Republican-introduced amendment that could have helped Crystal Mason and other Texans who were prosecuted for voting. They had voted after being released from prison, unaware that they were ineligible.",
      "A conference committee of the House and Senate removed the amendment. Both chambers of the Legislature passed the final version of the bill on Tuesday.",
      "But the noise made by Democrats, and the national media focus they drew to Texas, did appear to alter at least some measures that had prompted voting rights advocates to view the initial bills as the most restrictive in the country. The final version did not contain limits on Sunday voting hours \u2014 seen as an attempt to target \u201csouls to the polls\u201d events at Black churches \u2014 or provisions that made overturning elections easier.",
      "It also expanded weekday early voting by one hour and added a provision allowing voters to fix problems with absentee ballots.",
      "Even so, passage of the legislation was a stark demonstration of the political dominance of Texas by Republicans, who hope to hold onto the levers of power in the country\u2019s largest red state. More than 20 Democrats kept up their protest on Tuesday, remaining absent from the House.",
      "\u201cYou largely did what you wanted in this bill,\u201d Representative Senfronia Thompson, a Houston Democrat, told her Republican colleagues in the State House before the previous vote on the bill on Friday. \u201cThis is your bill. Your idea. And you will be responsible for the consequences.\u201d",
      "Representative Andrew Murr, the Republican sponsor in the House, defended the legislation on Friday, in a voice nearly hoarse from hours of debate. \u201cWe want Texans to be confident in the outcome of the system,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all strive for improvement, and I believe that that is what we are looking at today with this legislation, is improving the election code in Texas.\u201d",

Nearly all of them were closed on Tuesday, but the place was thrumming with nervous, negative energy \u2014 and with people suffering and scheming, or not sure where to go or what to do.",
      "On the corner of Josephine Street, dozens of Spanish-speaking day workers crowded around a reporter when they heard the conversation turn to food. There were about 40 Hispanic men, all hoping to catch a cleanup job. But no vans or trucks came by. The sun was beating strong. The men were sweating.",

He said he was afraid the levees might still be breached.",

      "The announcement is the latest twist in a political fight over masking in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, issued a ban on masks in school in July, only to be swatted back by a judge last week.",
      "Richard Corcoran, the state education commissioner, said in a statement that the department would fight to protect parents\u2019 rights to make health care decisions for their children, adding: \u201cThey know what is best for their children.\u201d",
      "The penalty applies to two school districts \u2014 Alachua County and Broward County \u2014 that went ahead with mask mandates in defiance of the governor\u2019s order.",
      "The department had indicated that it would withhold a monthly amount equivalent to school board members\u2019 salaries. In Alachua County, members make about $40,000 a year, and in Broward County about $46,000, according to the State Legislature\u2019s Office of Economic and Demographic Research.",

Mr. Corcoran had previously said that he might recommend withholding funds \u201cin an amount equal to the salaries of the superintendent and all the members of the school board.\u201d",
      "On Monday, his department said that the counties had been instructed to cut school board compensation \u2014 and nothing else.",

      "And the family of a dangerously depressed teenager chose to continue hospitalizing their child despite the refusal by their insurance plan, for West Virginia state employees, to cover more than 30 days of hospital care in a year, leaving them with tens of thousands of dollars in unpaid medical bills.",
      "The pandemic has fueled a soaring need for mental health and substance abuse services, revealing deepening gaps in coverage under the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, the landmark law intended to eliminate a double standard in insurance coverage. Exemptions under state or local government coverage for employees like teachers and police officers and potentially illegal workarounds put in place by employers and insurers, coupled with lax oversight, have resulted in unequal access to care for millions of people.",
      "In general, under the federal law, insurers are prohibited from offering plans that treat depression differently than, say, diabetes; no longer can they impose strict limits on treatment, or set up overly stringent pre-authorization policies or exclude categories of care like residential programs.",
      "The Affordable Care Act, which withstood its latest Supreme Court challenge in June, also declared treatment for mental health and substance abuse disorders one of the essential benefits that health insurers had to provide.",
      "In an indication that regulators are taking a renewed interest in enforcing the law, the U.S. Department of Labor, along with the New York state attorney general\u2019s office and individual plaintiffs, reached a settlement with UnitedHealthcare, the giant insurer, in early August over accusations that it had violated the parity law.",
      "But the exemption afforded governments for their employees is widely in use, particularly in strained economic times, maintaining a loophole some advocates have tried to close repeatedly. Dozens of plans across the country have requested an exemption for the current coverage year, according to the most recent list compiled by the federal government.",

He is trying to persuade federal lawmakers to close this loophole, which he estimates affects a million people and their families.",
      "Linda Michaels, a psychologist in private practice in Chicago, said, \u201cI just don\u2019t get it, during this pandemic year.\u201d There, municipal employees like police officers and teachers must go through cumbersome steps to get approval for therapy sessions exceeding the limit of seven a year, under the Blue Cross plan offered.",

King, a Utah state legislator and Democrat who is interested in fixing the loophole in his state, where several state and local plans opted out of providing coverage.",
      "As a lawyer, he also represents patients in lawsuits against employers and insurers.",

      "The pandemic has taken an enormous toll on the well being of Americans, particularly adolescents. An analysis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found a significant increase in emergency room visits for suicide attempts among girls. Roughly half of Americans say the pandemic negatively affected their mental health, according to a recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit research group.",
      "Access remains a critical obstacle to mental health care. While some patients say they were not able to get treated because they could not find a provider, nearly a quarter said the main reason they did not get care was the cost, according to the Kaiser analysis. One in 10 said their insurance did not cover the care.",
      "County and state officials say they are aware their workers have been under tremendous stress, pointing to government plans that are not exempt. \u201cCounties do have a wide range of programs that address behavioral and mental health,\u201d said Teryn Zmuda, the chief economist for the National Association of Counties.",
      "The exception for government plans was aimed at preventing financial burdens on school districts, cities and states operating under strict budgets. The groups are trying to save money, said Jennifer Berman, an employee benefits lawyer and chief executive of MZQ Consulting, which advises companies\u2019 plans on compliance issues. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they don\u2019t want to provide mental health care,\u201d she said.",
      "But many of the government plans still contain the much-criticized restrictions that existed before the parity legislation was passed. In Michigan, a plan covering state employees places sharp limits on residential treatment for substance abuse and did not cover it for mental health issues.",
      "\u201cBoom, after 28 days, you have to pick up your son now or pay $2,000 a day,\u201d said the father of the 16-year-old, who asked not to be named to protect his family\u2019s privacy. His son was depressed and struggling with drug and alcohol abuse, exacerbated by the pandemic-related stress and isolation that has troubled his generation. The family is insured under a plan covering Michigan state workers.",
      "The end to coverage required the family to take their son home before he finished treatment, but he quickly relapsed. His parents are now spending tens of thousands of dollars on another program with the plan paying for a small fraction of the total cost.",
      "The Michigan Civil Service Commission, which oversees coverage for state employees, declined to comment.",
      "In West Virginia, one doctor working for the state health system paid roughly $110,000 for a treatment program for his child that he knew was not covered, only to face a $50,000 hospital bill last year because his child\u2019s hospital stay had exceeded the plan\u2019s limit \u2014 in spite of the fact that his child was too ill to be discharged. The hospital lost its appeal to the insurer for payment, he said.",
      "\u201cThis was a real surprise,\u201d said the father, who asked to be identified only by his middle name, Paul, to protect his family\u2019s privacy. \u201cThey had never seen this before.\u201d",
      "West Virginia lawmakers have since passed legislation requiring parity for coverage for mental health and substance abuse disorders, although the plan covering the doctor still operated under an exemption in the government\u2019s most recent lists. State plan officials did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Even relatively inexpensive treatment can be hard to get. In Chicago, one of Dr. Michael\u2019s former patients, Julia, whose husband worked for the city and asked not to be identified by her last name to protect her family\u2019s privacy, compared coverage in recent years to treat her anxiety.",
      "In contrast to her previous policy with another Blue Cross plan, a new one overseen by an outside company required cumbersome pre-authorizations for therapy, she said. She had to provide detailed information that formerly had been supplied by her therapist, including the exact diagnosis code and the so-called NPI number used to identify the provider. The company began approving fewer visits at a time, she said.",
      "\u201cIt just forces you to jump through the hoops, calling back and keeping track,\u201d she said. If you missed an authorization, you had to pay the full cost of the session.",
      "She also said she was pressured to estimate the length of the treatment or when it might end, a timetable sought in stark contrast to any questions about her other medical conditions. \u201cI don\u2019t have to get my dermatology appointments preapproved,\u201d she said. \u201cRosea is never going away. No one is asking my dermatologist to cure rosea.\u201d",
      "She stopped therapy when she felt she could adequately manage her condition.",
      "Advocates and patients say that enforcement of the law has often been lax, and that many insurers and employers resist paying for expensive treatments for mental health. But the involvement of both state and federal regulators in the $14 million settlement with United \u201cis very significant,\u201d said D. Brian Hufford, a lawyer with Zuckerman Spaeder, whose firm represented the individuals in the private lawsuits. His firm also represented the plaintiffs in another lawsuit against United that resulted in a 2019 ruling against the company in which a federal judge in Northern California said that one of its units had created internal policies aimed at effectively discriminating against patients to save money. United said the care provided to its customers was appropriate, and the case is now being appealed.",
      "In the latest case, the insurer was accused of reducing how much it paid for out-of-network mental health services, resulting in patients being overcharged, and imposing stricter treatment limits than for medical and surgical services. Martin J. Walsh, the U.S. labor secretary, said in a statement, \u201cProtecting access to mental health and substance use disorder treatment is a priority for the Department of Labor and something I believe in strongly as a person in long-term recovery.\u201d",
      "United said it was \u201cpleased to resolve these issues related to business practices no longer used by the company.\u201d",
      "These suits underscore the reluctance by insurers responsible for handling claims to cover this care, Mr. Hufford said. Unlike a broken bone or cancer diagnosis, where insurers have little discretion, \u201cbehavioral health is not so cut and dried,\u201d he said.",
      "Congress has also taken some steps to increase enforcement. As part of the budget package passed last December, lawmakers required plans to evaluate how well they were complying with the law and authorized the Department of Labor to conduct reviews.",
      "And some members of Congress are calling for a closing of the loophole. \u201cEvery insurance plan needs to cover mental health care \u2014 no exceptions,\u201d Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, a Democrat, said in a statement. \u201cThis should be a no-brainer,\u201d he said.",
      "Unions that represent these employees are also calling for change. \u201cWe have been working to fix this issue for quite some time,\u201d Lee Saunders, the president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said in a statement. \u201cIt comes down to the fact that we want all workers to be treated equally and fairly under the law \u2014 that means closing this loophole in mental health care.\u201d"

    "title": "Meteorologists were amazed by how fast Ida strengthened.",
    "content": [
      "As Hurricane Ida closed in on the Louisiana coast on Sunday morning, meteorologists were stunned to watch the storm strengthen so quickly.",
      "When Dale Eck, the head of forecast operations for the Americas at IBM, went to bed on Saturday night, he said, Ida\u2019s winds were blowing at 105 miles an hour, which is Category 2-level wind speed. The next morning, he saw the winds had increased to 150 m.p.h., strong enough for a Category 4 classification.",
      "\u201cI got a sinking feeling in my stomach,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was one of the worst-case scenarios.\u201d",
      "The storm had evolved swiftly from a worrisome disturbance in the Atlantic Ocean to possibly the most devastating to strike Louisiana since Hurricane Katrina in 2005.",
      "Before Ida became a named storm on Thursday, forecasters detected what they thought was just another cluster of thunderstorms, or a disturbance, moving west over the Atlantic, said Ben Gelber, a meteorologist at WCMH-TV in Columbus, Ohio.",
      "It quickly became clear that this disturbance was unique, because it was hovering in an area where the wind wasn\u2019t fast enough to carry the ocean\u2019s heat away from the system, Mr. Eck said. That allowed the heat to stay inside the system, creating the perfect humid environment for the disturbance to intensify into a tropical storm.",
      "\u201cIt would have been hard to concoct a path more favorable to this rapid strengthening than Ida\u2019s,\u201d said Robert Henson, an independent meteorologist and a journalist for Yale Climate Connections.",
      "Ida reached Cuba on Friday as a Category 1 hurricane, the lowest of the five hurricane classifications. From there, forecasters knew the storm would be intense, and the only question was just how bad it would get.",
      "From Saturday into Sunday, a cauldron of weather conditions made Ida a devastating Category 4 storm: Its winds accelerated rapidly to 150 m.p.h.; a ridge of high-pressure air off the Southeastern United States shepherded the storm toward Louisiana; and the waters in the Gulf of Mexico were unusually warm and very deep, meaning that there was a lot water Ida could churn up to sustain itself.",
      "The fact that the water was still warm was reason to worry that the storm could continue to strengthen to a low Category 5, said Benjamin Schott, the meteorologist in charge for the National Weather Service in New Orleans.",
      "On Twitter, meteorologists across the country expressed alarm at how quickly Ida evolved into a colossal threat.",
      "\u201cI desperately wish the forecast hadn\u2019t become reality,\u201d said Rick Knabb, a hurricane expert at the Weather Channel, adding that rapid intensification before landfall is \u201cthe hurricane scenario we\u2019ve always dreaded.\u201d",
      "Eric Blake, a senior hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center, said: \u201cI feel sick to my stomach watching this hurricane. This is a very sobering morning.\u201d"

    "title": "Go-to Lawyer for Capitol Riot Defendants Disappears",
    "content": [
      "The mysterious disappearance of the lawyer John Pierce began last Tuesday, prosecutors say, when he missed a hearing for one of the many cases where he is representing a defendant in the Capitol riot investigation. The young associate who took his place said that Mr. Pierce had a \u201cconflict.\u201d At the time, no one seemed to give it much mind.",
      "But in the days that followed, Mr. Pierce \u2014 who is defending more cases connected to the riot than any other lawyer \u2014 missed additional hearings and the reasons for his absence started changing.",
      "On Wednesday, his associate told a judge in one case that Mr. Pierce had gotten Covid-19 and was in the hospital on a ventilator \u2014 but only after telling a prosecutor in another case that Mr. Pierce had been in a car accident. That same evening, a different associate told a reporter that Mr. Pierce had in fact been hospitalized, but was getting care for \u201cdehydration and exhaustion.\u201d",
      "Finally, on Monday \u2014 after Mr. Pierce had still failed to emerge \u2014 the government got involved. Federal prosecutors issued letters to several judges in 17 Capitol riot cases, informing them that no one in the Justice Department had heard from Mr. Pierce in a week and that \u201cmultiple\u201d phone numbers for his law firm appeared to have been disconnected.",
      "His criminal cases had come to a \u201cstandstill,\u201d the prosecutors said, endangering the rights of his clients. If Mr. Pierce did not surface soon, they added, something \u2014 though it was not clear what \u2014 would have to be done.",
      "The New York Times tried to reach Mr. Pierce several times by text and phone in recent days, but he did not respond.",
      "Mr. Pierce\u2019s unexplained absence was only the latest twist in his outsized role in defending those accused of participating in the Capitol attack. His clients \u2014 among them members of the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers militia \u2014 have stood out not only for their number, but also for the scorched-earth battle that he has vowed to wage on their behalf.",
      "A self-described pro-Trump populist, Mr. Pierce has promised, for example, to force the government to give him video footage of the Capitol for several days before and after Jan. 6, and has said he will demand information about every police officer working at the building that day. He has also vowed to subpoena hostile witnesses like Speaker Nancy Pelosi, ostensibly to learn what she may have known about security at the Capitol before the attack.",
      "Without citing evidence, Mr. Pierce has said he intends to implicate the F.B.I. and the intelligence community by showing that the riot was something like a grand act of entrapment or an inside job. He has often talked about his cases with a conspiratorial zeal, painting himself as something like a lonely legal warrior out to save his clients from an overreaching government.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m like Gerard Butler in \u2018300,\u2019\u201d Mr. Pierce said in an interview before dropping out of sight, comparing himself to the action star who played a Spartan king. \u201cI\u2019m in the hot gates at Thermopylae, holding the pass against the million-man Persian army.\u201d",
      "While the government has not yet weighed in on the merits on his claims, prosecutors did express concern in their letters filed on Monday about the young associate, Ryan Joseph Marshall, who has been standing in for Mr. Pierce at the hearings he has missed.",
      "For one thing, Mr. Marshall is not a licensed lawyer, prosecutors said, and has taken actions on behalf of clients \u201cthat he is not permitted\u201d to take. Moreover, they went on, it remains unclear if and when Mr. Marshall will be able to get his law license given that he is under indictment in two criminal cases accusing him of corruption, theft and fraud in Pennsylvania.",
      "Mr. Pierce\u2019s situation is not his first encounter with personal and professional setbacks. Last year, his law firm nearly collapsed in a swirl of debts and resignations. Then his most prominent client, Kyle Rittenhouse, the young man charged with murder at a racial justice protest in Wisconsin last year, fired him in a highly public spat that included allegations that a charity arranged for the defense had engaged in financial improprieties.",
      "His work in the Capitol cases began just after the attack when he took several members of the far-right nationalist group the Proud Boys as clients. He has also been hired by L. Brent Bozell IV, the son of a prominent conservative commentator, as well as by a Florida pastor and a Minnesota pub worker.",
      "In recent weeks, however, at least two clients have fired Mr. Pierce, complaining that he seemed unresponsive and appeared at times to be unversed in the details of their cases. Last week,  the wife of yet another client, Kenneth Harrelson, a member of the Oath Keepers from Florida, sent a letter to her friends and associates, complaining that her husband was having \u201cissues\u201d getting Mr. Pierce \u201cto do his job.\u201d",
      "Such complaints have come atop concerns that the sheer number of Mr. Pierce\u2019s clients has exposed him to accusations of conflict of interest. He is, for example, representing both James Cusick Jr., the Florida pastor, and Mr. Cusick\u2019s son Casey, who are charged with breaching the Capitol with another of his clients, David J. Lesperance, a member of the Cusicks\u2019 church.",
      "In a separate case, Mr. Pierce has been hired by another father-and-son pair, Kevin and Nathaniel Tuck, two former Florida police officers who have been charged in an indictment with a Florida Proud Boy he also represents.",
      "Almost eight months after a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol, two separate processes have been taking place in Washington. In one, the Justice Department has been filing charges resulting in nearly 600 criminal cases that have only begun to delve into the violence of Jan. 6. In another, conservatives have been waging a war of narratives, playing down the attack as the work of mere tourists or calling it a false-flag operation by the F.B.I.",
      "Mr. Pierce has placed himself at the nexus of these efforts. While he has filed motions and \u2014 before his absence \u2014 appeared at hearings like any other lawyer, he has also maintained a steady presence on social media and right-wing media outlets, questioning the \u201cStasi-like tactics\u201d of the F.B.I., teasing purported revelations about the fatal shooting of Ashli Babbitt inside the Capitol and attacking the investigation as political persecution.",
      "Perhaps the best example of this is his plan to raise a so-called public authority defense for some of his clients, arguing that they cannot be held accountable for the Capitol attack because they were following official U.S. policy.",
      "But Mr. Pierce will most likely not point to the role that former President Donald J. Trump had in whipping up supporters to storm the building. Instead, he has said that he believes that F.B.I. operatives and intelligence personnel, working undercover, incited the crowd to violence. And he has urged other defense lawyers to help him find proof.",
      "All of that, of course, can only come to pass if he returns to court \u2014 and the government seems worried that might never happen.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, it seems that Mr. Pierce may be hospitalized and unable to communicate,\u201d prosecutors wrote on Monday, \u201cand it is unclear when Mr. Pierce will recover.\u201d"

      "Ballots returned by mail must be postmarked by Sept. 14. (You don\u2019t need to add a stamp; you should have a return envelope.) Voters can also return their ballots to a secure drop box by Sept. 14 at 8 p.m. (Look up the ones closest to you here.)",

      "You can look up ballot drop boxes near you on the California secretary of state\u2019s website. You can also mail the ballot back.",
      "You can check whether you\u2019re registered to vote here. If you\u2019re not registered within 14 days of an election, in California, you can also register the day of the vote. (So, in this case, on Sept. 14.) You can learn more about same-day voter registration here.",

      "There are 46 candidates listed on the ballot, a mix of politicians, entertainers and business people that includes the Olympian and reality television star Caitlyn Jenner; the businessman John Cox, who campaigned with a Kodiak bear; and Kevin Paffrath, a YouTube personality who in a debate suggested he\u2019d solve California\u2019s water problems with a pipeline to the Mississippi River.",

      "No, and you can\u2019t write him in. (See above.) California law prohibits the incumbent from being listed in a recall as a replacement candidate.",
      "Yes.",
      "No one. In fact, Mr. Newsom has encouraged voters to skip that question entirely. (Just as long as they vote \u201cNo\u201d on the question of whether he should be recalled.)",
      "No, only the recall. There wasn\u2019t enough time for any ballot initiatives to qualify.",
      "After Election Day, county election officials have to complete their work receiving and counting ballots, although we may have some idea of the vote by then, since nearly eight million ballots have already been returned and many more are expected to come in as we get closer. Counties can process early ballots and get them ready to count, but they cannot start tallying until 8 p.m. Pacific, when the polls close.",
      "Vote counting tends to be slow in California because there are so many voters. And there is a seven-day window after the election to allow mail-in ballots postmarked on Sept. 14 to arrive.",
      "But the large number of early returns should streamline the tally, and counties must begin reporting results to the states within two hours after the polls close.",
      "Thirty-eight days after the election, the California secretary of state will certify the election results and, if the recall is successful, the new governor will be sworn in.",
      "It doesn\u2019t matter. The recall question is determined by majority vote. If more than 50 percent of the voters vote yes on the recall, Mr. Newsom must step down as governor.",
      "The replacement question is determined by who gets the most votes among the challengers on the ballot. So 49.9 percent of the voters can back Mr. Newsom, and he can still lose to someone who is supported by only, say, 20 percent of the electorate. On the replacement question, the winner does not need a majority to be named the next governor.",
      "In some states, such as Oregon and Michigan, if a governor is recalled by voters, the secretary of state or lieutenant governor automatically gets the job. But California law states that voters must choose who replaces the governor in an election.",
      "Of the 19 states that allow recalls of state officials, most leave the choice of replacement in the hands of voters.",
      "The new governor would be in office for the remainder of Mr. Newsom\u2019s term, which would be through Jan. 2, 2023. (California has a regularly scheduled election for governor next year.)",
      "Initially, the Republicans who started the recall disagreed with Mr. Newsom on issues like the death penalty and his opposition to President Donald Trump\u2019s policies. The effort was widely viewed as a long shot.",
      "Then two particular factors boosted the campaign: A judge allowed more time for leaders of the recall to gather signatures because of pandemic lockdowns. And growing frustration among some Californians over health restrictions came to a head when Mr. Newsom was seen dining maskless with lobbyists at an expensive, exclusive Napa Valley restaurant called the French Laundry after asking Californians to wear masks and stay home.",
      "As the pandemic dragged on, recall supporters focused their arguments on the governor\u2019s response, criticizing it as overly restrictive. Prolonged school closures drew ire during the last school year, as did pandemic unemployment fraud.",
      "More recently, proponents have argued that broader social ills such as homelessness have worsened during Mr. Newsom\u2019s tenure, that Democrats have de facto one-party rule in California and that the high cost of living is driving Californians out.",
      "Mr. Newsom\u2019s Democratic allies charge that the effort is an undemocratic far-right power grab by Trumpian extremists who would otherwise never see a Republican elected to California\u2019s top state office.",
      "They also note that if U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein\u2019s term ends prematurely, the governor will appoint her replacement, which could flip the balance of power in the U.S. Senate and allow Republicans to block, for example, President Biden\u2019s nominees to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Mr. Newsom\u2019s supporters have lauded the governor\u2019s handling of the pandemic, citing California\u2019s relative success in controlling the virus, record state aid for families and businesses hurt by the pandemic and California\u2019s swift rebound to economic health.",
      "The recall is being funded mostly by conservative and Republican donors. Geoff Palmer, a Southern California real estate developer and Donald Trump supporter, for instance, has donated more than $1 million. John Kruger, an Orange County charter school supporter who objected to pandemic restrictions on religious gatherings, donated $500,000 to the recall at an early key point. The Republican Party has pumped money into the effort, as have national figures such as Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor.",
      "But money in favor of the recall has been dwarfed by the fund-raising against it. California law treats the recall question as a ballot issue, which means the campaigns for and against the recall can accept unlimited donations. The replacement candidates, however, must abide by a $32,400-per-election limit on individual contributions. All the donations to replacement candidates, put together, are still smaller than the governor\u2019s war chest.",
      "Among individual campaigns with the most money, those who have donated the maximum to Mr. Elder largely reflect the recall\u2019s broader funding, with substantial contributions from conservative and Trump-supporting Republicans. Mr. Faulconer\u2019s top donors include more moderate Republicans such as William Oberndorf, a major G.O.P. donor who opposed Mr. Trump\u2019s election, and a variety of business interests. Mr. Cox, a Republican who lost in 2018 to Mr. Newsom, has largely self-funded his campaign.",
      "The recall opposition is being funded mostly by establishment interests, organized labor and Democrats. The founder of Netflix, Reed Hastings, has donated $3 million to defend Mr. Newsom, for example. Show business and Silicon Valley have heavily donated against the recall. Labor groups \u2014 unions for teachers, prison guards, health workers and other public employees \u2014 have made major donations. So have tribal organizations in the state and major business groups such as the California Association of Realtors and chambers of commerce. Mr. Newsom used his financial edge to swamp his Republican rivals and proponents of the recall on television by a nearly four-to-one ratio in July and August, spending $20.4 million to the recall supporters\u2019 $5.6 million, according to data provided by the ad-tracking firm AdImpact.",
      "The Los Angeles Times, The San Diego Union-Tribune, The Mercury News, The San Francisco Chronicle and The Sacramento Bee have urged voters to vote no on the recall, arguing that, at a cost of some $276 million, it is a waste of money or that the time to vote for or against the governor is next year, when he runs for re-election.",
      "The Orange County Register, which is traditionally a right-of-center opinion page, recommends a yes vote and endorsed Mr. Elder in an editorial that was picked up by some suburban papers under the same ownership in Southern California.",
      "The Bakersfield Californian recommends a yes vote and endorsed Mr. Faulconer.",
      "National newspapers also have weighed in on the recall. The New York Times came out in opposition to the recall, and The Wall Street Journal blamed it on housing policies in California.",
      "Here is an expanded explainer. Here is an episode of \u201cThe Daily\u201d podcast on the recall. Here is the California secretary of state\u2019s guide to the recall.",
      "Here is a guide from the nonprofit, nonpartisan news site CalMatters to Governor Newsom\u2019s record. And here is a recent debate among Mr. Paffrath, Mr. Cox, Mr. Kiley and Mr. Faulconer.",
      "Here are interviews with Mr. Elder, Mr. Kiley, Mr. Cox and Mr. Paffrath by CalMatters, a Fox News interview with Caitlyn Jenner; and an interview that The Sacramento Bee did with Mr. Faulconer.",
      "State and local officials said the ballot holes in envelopes were placed in the envelope, on either end of a signature line, to help low-vision voters know where to sign it, said Jenna Dresner, a spokeswoman for the California Secretary of State\u2019s Office of Election Cybersecurity.",
      "One of the biggest unfounded rumors circulating about the election is that the holes were being used to screen out votes that say \u201cyes\u201d to a recall. Here\u2019s more about how that rumor circulated online.",
      "Most changes to the process require amendments to the State Constitution, where the right to a recall was enshrined in 1911.",
      "Amending the Constitution takes two steps:",
      "First, the State Legislature has to pass the proposed amendment with two-thirds in support in each house. (Alternatively, voters can collect close to a million signatures in support; experts say this route is less likely.)",
      "Then, the amendment appears on a statewide ballot, where it requires a simple majority to become law.",
      "There are some less fundamental changes that the Legislature could enact without voter approval, such as a ban on paid signature gathering.",
      "But the most common ideas \u2014 such as raising the signature requirement above 12 percent, allowing the incumbent to run as a replacement candidate or having the lieutenant governor automatically replace a recalled governor \u2014 would require constitutional amendments."

    "title": "Two Top F.D.A. Vaccine Regulators Are Set to Depart During a Crucial Period",
    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Two of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s top vaccine regulators will leave the agency this fall, a development that could disrupt its work on deciding whether to recommend coronavirus vaccines for children under 12 and booster shots for the general population.",
      "Dr. Marion Gruber, the director of the F.D.A.\u2019s vaccines office, will retire at the end of October, and her deputy, Dr. Philip Krause, will leave in November, according to an email that Dr. Peter Marks, the agency\u2019s top vaccine regulator, sent to staff members on Tuesday morning. One reason is that Dr. Gruber and Dr. Krause were upset about the Biden administration\u2019s recent announcement that adults should get a coronavirus booster vaccination eight months after they received their second shot, according to people familiar with their thinking.",
      "Neither believed there was enough data to justify offering booster shots yet, the people said, and both viewed the announcement, amplified by President Biden, as pressure on the F.D.A. to quickly authorize them.",
      "Dr. Marks said he would serve as the acting director of the vaccines office while the agency searched for its next leader. Stephanie Caccomo, a spokeswoman for the agency, said it was \u201cconfident in the expertise and ability of our staff to continue our critical public health work.\u201d",
      "Some public health experts have said the administration\u2019s booster shot announcement, which did include a caveat that the F.D.A. would first have to authorize such shots, undermined the agency\u2019s responsibility to make that assessment on its own schedule, led by career scientists. Since Mr. Biden took office in January, the White House has made a point of saying it would not influence the F.D.A.\u2019s work.",
      "Some outside experts have also challenged the booster plan as premature, saying the available data shows that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are holding up well against severe disease and hospitalization, including against the Delta variant. Extra shots would be warranted only if the vaccines failed to meet that standard, some have said.",
      "White House officials have stressed that the plan for Americans to start receiving boosters next month was uniformly endorsed by the most senior federal health officials, including Dr. Janet Woodcock, the acting F.D.A. commissioner. They have described the need to develop a booster plan as urgent in light of growing evidence that the vaccines lose potency over time \u2014 a trend that they fear suggests the vaccines\u2019 protection against severe disease and hospitalization will also soon weaken.",
      "Officials have singled out data from Israel as a particularly worrisome sign, especially for older adults and other vulnerable groups. Data from abroad \u201cactually has led us to be even more concerned about increased risk of vaccine effectiveness waning against hospitalization, severe disease and death,\u201d Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a White House briefing on the pandemic Tuesday.",
      "Asked about reports that Dr. Gruber and Dr. Krause were unhappy with what they viewed as pressure on the agency, Jeffrey D. Zients, the White House\u2019s Covid-19 response coordinator, reiterated that the booster strategy had always been contingent on F.D.A. review.",
      "\u201cAs our medical experts laid out, having reviewed all the available data, it is in their clinical judgment that it is time to prepare Americans for a booster shot,\u201d he said at the briefing. \u201cWe announced our approach in order to stay ahead of the virus, give states and pharmacies time to plan, and to be transparent with the American people.\u201d",
      "But some critics have said that explanation falls short, because F.D.A. regulators are in the position of trying to determine whether booster shots are safe and effective after the White House \u2014 and their own agency head, Dr. Woodcock \u2014 already endorsed administering them.",
      "\u201cThis process has been the reverse of what we would normally expect in vaccine policy,\u201d with the administration announcing plans based on a certain outcome before regulators can complete their review, said Jason L. Schwartz, an associate professor of health policy at the Yale School of Public Health. \u201cThat has made it even more complicated and confusing for the public.\u201d",
      "The announcement of the departures comes at a critical time for the F.D.A. The agency is in the midst of a marathon push to decide several important questions about the three coronavirus vaccines it authorized on an emergency basis over the past year. It is facing public pressure from some quarters to speed up, and from others to slow down. Mr. Biden still has not nominated someone to permanently lead the agency, a post that requires Senate confirmation.",
      "Only about three weeks remain before the Biden administration wants to begin offering boosters to recipients of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, starting with nursing home residents, health care workers and others who were inoculated early in the vaccination campaign.",
      "The F.D.A. is currently trying to schedule a meeting of its panel of independent experts, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, to discuss booster shots, according to people familiar with the agency\u2019s planning. That meeting would be public, and could potentially reveal concerns among regulators and the F.D.A.\u2019s outside experts about the administration\u2019s strategy.",
      "The F.D.A. is also expected soon to tackle the question of whether to authorize coronavirus vaccines on an emergency basis for children under 12.",
      "Last week, the agency fully approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for people 16 and older, a major decision that spurred a series of vaccine mandates at corporations, universities, hospitals and elsewhere.",
      "That decision and a host of others fell to teams led by Dr. Gruber and Dr. Krause, working under Dr. Marks.",
      "The F.D.A. reviews data from vaccine manufacturers on safety and efficacy, and sometimes makes decisions with input from the outside advisory committee of vaccine experts. The agency\u2019s decisions are followed by recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, after it hears from its own outside panel of experts.",
      "Both Dr. Gruber and Dr. Krause have been at the agency for 30 years and have long experience reviewing vaccines, including for Ebola. The office they lead evaluates annual flu vaccines, including which strains each year\u2019s version targets, and it had a central role in the F.D.A.\u2019s authorization of three coronavirus vaccines, which also include a single-dose shot from Johnson & Johnson.",
      "Their office also guides manufacturers on what kinds of studies they need to conduct to evaluate new vaccines, then reviews the data on them. The F.D.A. came under enormous pressure last fall by Trump administration officials to water down or scuttle standards it had set for vaccine emergency use authorizations, but prevailed in publishing the guidelines. Dr. Stephen M. Hahn, the F.D.A. commissioner under President Donald J. Trump, said on Tuesday that Dr. Gruber and Dr. Krause \u201cstuck together and marshaled amazing resources and got the authorizations done in record time.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey set the gold standard\u201d for vaccine reviews, said Dr. Luciana Borio, the former acting chief scientist at the agency under President Barack Obama. During the pandemic, she added, \u201cthey put their heads down and organized their team to do this work under tremendous pressure, but do it in a rigorous, expedited and flexible form.\u201d"

    "title": "Why Are So Many Government Positions Still Vacant?",
    "content": [
      "One of the running criticisms of the Trump administration was how slowly it nominated and won confirmation for hundreds of high-level government officials, especially in critical agencies like the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "But things aren\u2019t going much better with the Biden administration. And arguably, the situation is worse: In the middle of a pandemic, there is still no confirmed head of the Food and Drug Administration, and there is no confirmed ambassador to Afghanistan to help manage the crisis there.",
      "To understand what\u2019s going on, I turned to Max Stier, the head of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan organization that tracks vacancies and advises the government on how to improve the nomination and confirmation process.",
      "He made clear that while the Biden team was woefully behind, the problem was not unique to it \u2014 or to the Trump administration. Rather, he said, it\u2019s typical of a broken system that has led to a long string of government failures.",
      "\u201cYou can go back in time, if it was the response to Hurricane Katrina under the Bush administration, or the botched rollout of healthcare.gov under the Obama administration, or any number of issues in the Trump administration,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is an execution gap of consequence. And one of the big reasons for that is that the leadership system is broken.\u201d",
      "A transcript of our interview, edited and condensed, follows.",
      "Where does the Biden administration stand in terms of its nominations and confirmations?",
      "There\u2019s a set of 800 positions that we consider the most fundamental, and of those, they only have 127 that are confirmed, and they have 206 that are waiting in the queue. That still leaves a pretty substantial number that needs to be nominated.",
      "It\u2019s hard to believe, but we\u2019re past the seven-month mark in this administration. You have a Senate that operates like a two-lane country highway, and you have a big traffic jam because you\u2019ve got legislative priorities and budget issues and judicial nominations.",
      "And why is this a problem? Don\u2019t they have acting officials in place?",
      "When no one\u2019s there, you do have someone in the acting role, but they\u2019re the substitute teachers. They might be amazing educators, but we all know that the substitute teacher doesn\u2019t get respect from the class, and they don\u2019t see their job as taking on the long-term problems because they don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll be around tomorrow. What I\u2019m painting for you is a broader system failure in our government. You wind up with workarounds like acting leadership, or in the last administration, an effort to simply avoid a confirmed leadership in many instances.",
      "Speaking of the last administration, how does President Biden\u2019s record compare with Donald Trump\u2019s?",
      "The Biden team is ahead in their nominations of where Trump was at this point in time, but they\u2019re actually neck and neck in the number of confirmed people.",
      "It\u2019s easy to see why the Senate could be a roadblock for confirmations, but what explains the lag in nominations?",
      "There\u2019s an interrelationship between the two. One of the challenges any administration faces is thinking about the likelihood of getting people confirmed. A difficult confirmation process impacts the nomination process. There\u2019s a lot of risk aversion. And, frankly, their ability to recruit is hurt. Think about all the people who would throw in their hat knowing they\u2019ll be a part of that cool-your-jet package. Everything you do gets scrutinized enormously, and you have to be thoughtful and careful about what you should be doing that might get you in trouble.",
      "And to add a complication, a current nominee can\u2019t also serve as the acting leader, according to a relatively recent Supreme Court decision. For example, if the Biden administration nominated Janet Woodcock to serve as the F.D.A. commissioner, she would have to step down from her present role as acting commissioner. Congress should fix this.",
      "Which agencies worry you the most?",
      "I think the State Department is plainly one of the most obvious places with significant gaps. Of the positions we track, the State Department has the most gaps of any agency. But the truth is, you only have 127 confirmed positions, so there are problems pretty much everywhere. The most noticeable ones are the places where there are current, obvious needs. So, there\u2019s the international issues, whether it\u2019s Afghanistan or China. You think about health care, where the lack of a confirmed F.D.A. commissioner is clearly a problem.",
      "The Office of Management and Budget director is not as obvious, but I think it is a truly fundamental role. There is very little in the federal government that is focused on the enterprise as a whole, but the Office of Management and Budget is. It\u2019s a tiny agency when you think about the entire government, but it\u2019s the nerve center, and to not have a confirmed director is a problem.",
      "Let\u2019s take Afghanistan as a case study. How does the lack of confirmed positions hurt us there?",
      "It\u2019s impossible to show a causal relationship, but we don\u2019t have an ambassador to Afghanistan, and while ambassadors aren\u2019t everything, they are your key point of contact in any given country. And yes, there are plenty of people involved in Afghanistan, but you\u2019d want every resource you could possibly have, and that\u2019s one of them. I\u2019m looking at the list of unconfirmed positions that might be needed over there: under secretary for public diplomacy, there\u2019s no nominee. Assistant secretary for conflict and stabilization operations. There\u2019s someone nominated and been reported out, but they\u2019re waiting. Not good. The list goes on. There will be someone there, but they\u2019re in acting capacities. That\u2019s just not a recipe for the best we need for our agencies.",
      "It\u2019s not good for dealing with our allies, either.",
      "Absolutely. And you do hear that fairly consistently. Our allies don\u2019t feel they have the people they need to talk to. All these problems are better solved through multilateral exercises, so coordinating those relations with all those countries and international entities is fundamental to putting our best foot forward.",
      "I keep coming back to this: The design of our system is broken. And we still have to work within the system until we fix it, and we\u2019re not doing that well, either. But we could. For example, historically, right before the August recess, the past several presidents have gotten substantial packets of nominees through the confirmation process, on average about 60. The Biden team got 11. And that\u2019s not good enough.",
      "So what do you see as the solutions?",
      "The easiest answer to having too many positions is to reduce them, substantially. This happened before, in 2011, when there was a reduction of about 160 positions. We need to see many multiples of that. You could cut in half the number of Senate-confirmed positions and not diminish the Senate\u2019s important oversight responsibility. The Senate doesn\u2019t lose if it has 600 rather than 1,200 confirmed positions, because it\u2019s not actually getting the confirmation opportunity for those 1,200 positions.",
      "Instead, some of them could be career positions. Some could be nonconfirmed political positions; some of them could be term positions. Depending on the nature of the job, you\u2019d want to see different things. At the Department of Energy, Secretary Jennifer Granholm wants the cybersecurity position to be a career position, not a Senate-confirmed position, because she says there needs to be someone in that job longer than two years.",
      "On the Senate side, you should improve the process. It doesn\u2019t have to be so ugly. To go back to the two-lane highway proposition, it\u2019s worse than that: It\u2019s a two-lane highway that has a lot of potholes in it. They require people to submit their data multiple times, and there\u2019s a huge amount of questions that get asked.",
      "Out of that 2011 legislation, there was a commission created to talk about how to improve it, and there are a lot of recommendations that are out there. For example, right now, any Senate-confirmed position requires a full field investigation by the F.B.I. But doesn\u2019t it depend on the nature of the job, whether you\u2019re C.I.A. director versus the person in charge of public housing at Housing and Urban Development? They don\u2019t distinguish, so the intensity of investment and intrusion is the same."

    "title": "The Economy Is Booming but Far From Normal, Posing a Challenge for Biden",
    "content": [
      "The American economy is growing at its fastest clip in a quarter-century, yet it remains far from normal, with some workers and small-business owners facing increasingly tough times while others thrive. That divergence poses a challenge to President Biden, who has promoted the nation\u2019s economic recovery as a selling point in his quest to win support for a multitrillion-dollar spending agenda that could cement his legacy.",
      "A summer that many business owners and consumers had hoped would bring a return to prepandemic activity has delivered waves of disappointment in key areas. Restaurants are short on staff and long on wait times. Prices have spiked for food, gasoline and many services. Shoppers are struggling to find used cars. Retailers are struggling to hire. Beach towns are jammed with tourists, but office towers in major cities remain ghost towns on weekdays, with the promised return of workers delayed by a resurgent coronavirus.",
      "The University of Michigan\u2019s Consumer Sentiment Index suffered one of its largest monthly losses in 40 years in August, driven by the rapidly spreading Delta variant and high inflation. The survey\u2019s chief economist, Richard Curtin, said the drop also reflected \u201can emotional response, from dashed hopes that the pandemic would soon end and lives could return to normal.\u201d",
      "Mr. Biden and his advisers are confident that many of those issues will improve in the fall. They expect hiring to continue at a strong pace or even accelerate, fattening worker paychecks and powering consumer spending. They remain hopeful that a reinvigorated labor market will take the place of the fading stimulus from the president\u2019s $1.9 trillion economic aid bill signed in the spring, and that the latest wave of the virus will not dampen growth significantly.",
      "On Friday, they released new projections forecasting that growth will hit 7.1 percent this year after adjusting for inflation, its highest rate since 1983.",
      "\u201cOur perspective is one of looking at an economy that is growing at historic rates,\u201d Brian Deese, the director of Mr. Biden\u2019s National Economic Council, said in an interview.",
      "But there is mounting evidence that the coming months of the recovery could be more halting and chaotic than administration officials predict, potentially imperiling millions of left-behind workers as their federal support runs dry.",
      "Private forecasters have pared back growth expectations for the end of the year, citing drags on spending from the spread of the Delta variant and from the nationwide expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits after this week. Emerging research suggests the end of those benefits might not immediately drive Americans back to the work force to fill the record level of open jobs nationwide.",
      "\u201cPeople will be surprised at how much the economy decelerates over the next year as the stimulus boost fades,\u201d said Jim O\u2019Sullivan, the chief U.S. macrostrategist for TD Securities.",
      "Administration officials do acknowledge some potential hurdles. Some big-city downtowns may never return to their prepandemic realities, and the economy will not be fully \u201cnormal\u201d until the virus is fully under control. They stress that increasing the nation\u2019s vaccination rate is the most important economic policy the administration can pursue to accelerate growth and lift consumer confidence, which has slumped this summer.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to put a timeline on this,\u201d said Cecilia Rouse, the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cWe won\u2019t feel totally completely normal until we have, whether we want to call it herd immunity or a greater fraction or percentage of the American population is vaccinated.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs we conquer the virus,\u201d she said, \u201cwe will regain normalcy.\u201d",
      "The economy\u2019s rebound this year has been stronger than almost anyone predicted last winter, a result of the initial wave of vaccinations and the boost from Mr. Biden\u2019s stimulus bill. Gross domestic product returned to its prepandemic level last spring, and retail sales have soared far beyond their pre-Covid path.",
      "Yet the recovery remains uneven and rattled by a rare set of economic crosswinds. In some sectors, consumer demand remains depressed. In others, spending is high but supply constraints \u2014 whether for materials or workers or both \u2014 are pushing up prices.",
      "For instance, the construction sector has regained most of the jobs lost early in the pandemic, and other industries, such as warehousing, have actually grown. But restaurants and hotels still employ millions fewer people than they did in February 2020. The result: There are more college graduates working in the United States today than when the pandemic began, but five million fewer workers without a college degree.",
      "Compounding the problem, employment in the biggest cities fell further than in smaller cities and rural areas, and it has rebounded more slowly. Employment among workers without a college degree living in the biggest cities is down more than 5 percent since February 2020, compared with about 2 percent for workers without a college degree in other parts of the country.",
      "Even as millions of people remain out of work, businesses across the country are struggling to fill a record number of job openings.  Many businesses have blamed expanded unemployment benefits for the labor shortage. If they are right, a flood of workers should be returning to the job market when the benefits end after Labor Day. But recent research has suggested that the benefits are playing at most a small role in keeping people out of the work force. That suggests that other factors are holding potential workers back, such as health concerns and child care issues, which might not ease quickly.",
      "The Michigan sentiment data and the fade-out of stimulus benefits suggest consumers may be set to pull back spending further. But other data shows Americans increased their savings during the pandemic, in part by banking previous rounds of government support, and could draw on those funds to maintain spending for months to come.",
      "Administration officials hope to buck up consumers and workers by pushing Congress to pass the two halves of Mr. Biden\u2019s longer-term economic agenda: a bipartisan infrastructure bill and a larger spending bill that could extend expanded tax credits for parents, subsidize child care and reduce prescription drug costs, among other initiatives.",
      "\u201cOur hope is that the new normal coming out of this crisis is not simply a return to the status quo and the economy, which was one that was not working for most working families,\u201d Mr. Deese said.",
      "The virus remains the biggest wild card for the outlook. There is little evidence in government data that the spread of the Delta variant has suppressed spending in retail stores. But air travel, as measured by the number of people screened at airport security checkpoints, has tailed off in recent days after returning to about 80 percent of where it was during the same week in 2019.",
      "Restaurant bookings on OpenTable, which had nearly returned to normal in June and July, are back down to 10 percent below their prepandemic level. Data from Homebase, which provides time-management software to small businesses, shows a sharp decline in the number of hours worked at restaurants and entertainment venues.",
      "The variant is already casting a shadow over the new school year, with some schools, including a middle school in Fredericksburg, Va., temporarily returning to virtual learning amid new outbreaks.",
      "Urban downtowns, once hopeful for a fall rebound in activity, are bracing for prolonged delays in white-collar workers returning to their offices.",
      "\u201cOur No. 1 job is to get office workers back \u2014 that\u2019s the driver of the downtown,\u201d said Paul Levy, the president and chief executive of the Center City District, a local business-development group in Philadelphia.",
      "Mr. Levy\u2019s group estimates that 30 percent of downtown office workers have returned so far to Philadelphia. It had been expecting that number to hit 75 to 80 percent after Labor Day, and had built an advertising campaign around the idea that the fall would mark a milestone in the return to normalcy.

    "title": "As Washington Stews, State Legislatures Increasingly Shape American Politics",
    "content": [
      "With the release of the 2020 census last month, the drawing of legislative districts that could in large part determine control of Congress for the next decade heads to the nation\u2019s state legislatures, the heart of Republican political power.",
      "Increasingly, state legislatures, especially in 30 Republican-controlled states, have seized an outsize role for themselves, pressing conservative agendas on voting, Covid-19 and the culture wars that are amplifying partisan splits and shaping policy well beyond their own borders.",
      "Indeed, for a party out of power in Washington, state legislatures have become enormous sources of leverage and influence. That is especially true for rural conservatives who largely control the legislatures in key states like Wisconsin, Texas and Georgia and could now lock in a strong Republican tilt in Congress and cement their own power for the next decade. The Texas Legislature\u2019s pending approval of new restrictions on voting is but the latest example.",
      "\u201cThis is in many ways genuinely new, because of the breadth and scope of what\u2019s happening,\u201d said Donald F. Kettl, a scholar of state governance at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cBut more fundamentally, the real point of the spear of Trumpism is appearing at the state and local level. State legislatures not only are keeping the flame alive, but nurturing and growing it.\u201d",
      "He added that the aggressive role played by Republican legislatures had much further to run.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s all this talk of whether or not Republicans are a party that has any future at this point,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the reality is that Republicans not only are alive and well, but living in the state legislatures. And they\u2019re going to be pushing more of this forward.\u201d",
      "The next battle, already underway in many states, is over the drawing of congressional and state legislative districts. Republicans control 26 of the legislatures that will draw political maps, compared with 13 for Democrats. (Other states have nonpartisan commissions that draw legislative districts, or have just one seat.)",
      "Democrats have embraced their own causes, passing laws to expand voting rights, raise minimum wages and tighten controls on firearms in the 18 states where they control the legislatures.",
      "But Republican legislatures are pursuing political and ideological agendas that dwarf those of their opponents. This year\u2019s legislative sessions have spawned the largest wave of anti-abortion legislation since the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Roe v. Wade decision in 1973. Many Republican legislatures have seized power from Democratic-leaning cities and counties on issues including policing, the coronavirus and tree preservation. They have made base-energizing issues like transgender rights and classroom teaching on race centerpieces of debate.",
      "Most important, they have rewritten election and voting laws in ways that largely hinder Democratic-leaning voters and give Republicans more influence over how elections are run \u2014 and, critics say, how they are decided. And in some states, they are eyeing their own versions of the Arizona State Senate\u2019s brazenly partisan review of the 2020 vote, a new and, to many, dangerous attack on the nonpartisan underpinnings of American elections.",
      "",
      "One reason for the new activism is obvious: With Republicans out of power in Washington and Congress largely gridlocked,  states are the party\u2019s prime venues for setting policy.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s been since Congress has even passed a budget,\u201d said Bryan Hughes, a Republican state senator who sponsored Texas\u2019 latest voting bill. \u201cSo yes, clearly more responsibilities have fallen to states.\u201d",
      "Many Democratic legislators say Republicans are shirking those responsibilities.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re one of four states with no pre-K education,\u201d said State Representative Ilana Rubel, an Idaho Democrat. \u201cWe have a major housing crisis. We have a property-tax crisis. Those were the things we thought would be discussed. Instead, we found ourselves in a Fox News fever dream where all they wanted to do was get into these manufactured crises at the national level.\u201d",
      "The national role being played by state legislatures reflects in part the sorting of Americans into opposing partisan camps. Thirty years ago, 15 of the 50 state legislatures were split between Republican and Democratic control. Today, only Minnesota\u2019s House and Senate are divided.",
      "And the system favors partisanship. Few pay attention to state assembly races, so roughly four in 10 seats nationwide are uncontested in general elections, said Gary Moncrief, a  co-author of the standard work on state politics, \u201cWhy States Matter.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat means the real decisions are made in the primaries,\u201d he said, where voters tend to be hard-liners.",
      "At first blush, state assemblies seem ill-suited to wield influence. Most are part-time affairs run by citizen lawmakers. But the minor-league image is not entirely deserved. State lawmakers control $2 trillion a year in spending and have a plate of issues, from prisons to schools to the opioid crisis, that can get lost in the whir of Washington politics.",
      "And increasingly, top Republican strategists and well-funded conservative groups like the American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC, have poured in money and resources and policy prescriptions, figuring that legislation with no chance of getting through Congress could sail through friendly statehouses.",
      "\u201cFrom where I stand, they have a far greater impact on the life of ordinary citizens than Congress,\u201d Tim Storey, the executive director of the National Conference of State Legislatures, said of the state-level bodies.",
      "If there is one area where state legislatures have the potential to shape the nation\u2019s politics to a degree that goes well beyond established boundaries, it is voting.",
      "Following former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s false claims of a stolen election, at least 18 states tightened voting rules, often in ways that most affect Democratic-leaning constituencies.",
      "Most glaringly, they also gave the party more power over the mechanisms of administering elections and counting ballots.",
      "Arkansas empowered the State Elections Board to investigate local elections and \u201ctake corrective action\u201d against suspected irregularities, purportedly to give Republicans a fair shake. Iowa and other states would levy fines and even criminal penalties for missteps by local election officials, raising concerns that punishments could be used for partisan gain.",
      "Georgia\u2019s legislature gave itself control over most appointments to the State Election Board and allowed it to investigate and replace local election officials. Already, lawmakers are seeking an inquiry in Fulton County, a Democratic stronghold, although procedural hurdles in the law raise questions about how easily it could be used for partisan ends.",
      "The legislature also gave elected county commissioners sole power to appoint local election board members, a change that has already enabled the removal of at least 10 members of those boards, most of them Democrats.",
      "Republicans say they are seeking to deter fraud and ensure that elections are better run. Many experts and most Democrats call the laws worrying, given efforts by G.O.P. legislators and officials in at least 17 states to halt or overturn the election of President Biden and their continuing calls for often partisan ballot reviews of long-settled elections. Many fear that such failed tactics are being retooled to succeed as early as 2024.",
      "\u201cThat is the absolutely last step toward an authoritarian system,\u201d said Thomas E. Mann, a co-author of two books about the implications of Republicans\u2019 rightward drift, \u201cand they\u2019re just hellbent on getting there.\u201d",
      "The Republican speaker of the Georgia House of Representatives, David Ralston, rejected that. Claims that his state\u2019s laws open back doors to sway election results, he said, amount to \u201chysteria.\u201d",
      "Compared to voting laws in Democratic bastions like New York or Delaware, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re much more ahead of the game.\u201d And while Republican claims of fraud dominated Georgia\u2019s 2020 elections, he noted that the voting rights advocate Stacey Abrams, who ran as a Democrat, had also refused to accept her loss in the 2018 race for governor, claiming voter suppression.",
      "Lawmakers also pushed through legislation overriding or banning actions by local officials, generally urban Democrats. Among the targets were measures like mask requirements and proposals to reduce police department budgets in response to last summer\u2019s unrest.",
      "Some see brakes on how far to the right Republican legislatures can go.",
      "Opponents are already taking the latest Republican initiatives to court. The federal Justice Department has sued to block portions of Georgia\u2019s new voting law and has warned that partisan meddling with election reviews like the one in Arizona risk violating federal laws.",
      "Lawyers for Democrats and voting-rights advocates are taking aim at other voting measures. And in some states, Democratic governors like Roy Cooper of North Carolina are serving as counterbalances to Republican legislatures.",
      "\u201cThis state would look very, very different if Roy Cooper had not been governor,\u201d said Christopher Cooper, a scholar of state politics at Western Carolina University, who is not related to the governor. \u201cHe\u2019s vetoed more bills than any governor in North Carolina history.\u201d",
      "Others doubt vetoes and court decisions will settle much. \u201cI don\u2019t see any solution from litigation,\u201d said Richard Briffault, a Columbia University expert on state legislation. \u201cIf there\u2019s going to be a change, it\u2019s going to be through the political process.\u201d",
      "And some say legislatures have the power to enact policy and a base that revels in what a few years back seemed like overreach. Why would they stop?",
      "\u201cThis has become the new normal,\u201d said Trey Martinez Fischer, one of the Texas Democrats who fled the state in July to block passage of the restrictive voting bill. \u201cAnd I would expect, with a Biden administration and a Democratic Congress, that we\u2019re likely to see more.\u201d"

      "Everything was closed. Supermarket parking lots were empty; restaurants and motels were deserted. A man evacuating by bicycle, clothing piled high behind his seat, pedaled past. The roads felt wider without any traffic.",
      "On the last days of August, Lake Tahoe would normally be thick with tourists paddleboarding, fishing, lounging, drinking and hiking.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ll never see South Lake Tahoe like this again,\u201d a resident told me before closing his car door and driving down an empty road toward Nevada.",
      "The mandatory evacuation zone created by the fast-moving Caldor fire extended from Tahoma, Calif., on the western shore of the lake, to the Nevada border as of Monday evening.",
      "And yet a 10-minute drive away there was urgency in the air as hundreds of firefighters fought to save Lake Tahoe. The Caldor fire, which ignited two weeks ago, crested a ridge on Monday and, propelled by strong winds, began descending into the well-populated Tahoe basin.",
      "The fire was 15 percent contained on Monday, although that number hardly seemed to matter as the fire bore down on South Lake Tahoe.",
      "Less than a dozen miles from the lakeshore, inmate fire crews bounded down mountainsides to put out spot fires. The switchbacks leading to Echo Summit, the 7,482-foot pass that leads to the Gold Rush towns along the American River, were covered with the yellow-jacketed men and women of Cal Fire. They squinted up at the mountain and the fire descending it.",
      "I drove between these two places on Monday evening, between the quiet town and fiery hillside, and I had trouble processing the contrast.",
      "It was almost as if South Lake Tahoe was taking a deep breath on Monday night, steeling itself for a battle with the fire that seemed determined to knock at its gates.",
      "Until Monday, the Caldor fire had burned up and down remote Sierra hillsides, brushing past tiny Gold Rush hamlets. More than 480 homes have been destroyed in the fire\u2019s path, many of them vacation cabins.",
      "But what comes next for the Caldor fire is a terrifying prospect of an entirely different magnitude. With the fire now in the Tahoe Basin, Cal Fire estimates that 33,679 homes are threatened.",

      "In normal times, the devastation of a massive hurricane like Ida tends to be followed by an aggressive rebuilding effort, as carpenters, roofers and other skilled workers descend on affected communities to repair the damage.",
      "These are not normal times.",
      "With the global supply chain besieged by trouble \u2014 extreme shipping delays, persistent product shortages and soaring costs \u2014 construction teams are likely to struggle to secure needed goods. At the same time, the hurricane\u2019s damage to critical industries in the Gulf Coast area and the urgent need to rebuild are expected to cascade through the country\u2019s already strained shipping infrastructure.",
      "\u201cThe supply was already terrible,\u201d said Eric Byer, the president of the National Association of Chemical Distributors, a trade association representing 400 companies that make and sell raw materials used in a vast array of industries, including construction and pharmaceuticals. \u201cNow, it\u2019s going to be worse.\u201d",
      "For months, a surge of trade from Asia to the United States has exhausted the supply of shipping containers, forcing buyers to pay 10 times the usual rate on popular routes like Shanghai to Los Angeles.",
      "As dockworkers have contracted Covid-19 or have landed in quarantine, loading and unloading at ports has been constrained. The pandemic has sidelined truck drivers, limiting the availability of vehicles that can carry products from ports to warehouses to customers.",
      "Hurricane Ida will almost certainly make this situation worse, as available trucks are diverted en masse toward affected communities to deliver relief supplies. No one questions the merits of this course, but it will leave even fewer trucks available to carry goods everywhere else, intensifying already-profound shortages.",
      "\u201cThe domestic trucking situation has been bad for some time, and the hurricane will add to that,\u201d said Megan Gluth-Bohan, the chief executive of TRInternational, an importer and distributor of chemicals just outside Seattle. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see more logjams at the ports.\u201d",
      "Her company relies on a supplier in Taiwan for hydrocarbon resins, selling them to American manufacturers of paints, varnishes and other coatings. She brings in chemicals from Thailand that are included in industrial cleaning products and imports glycols, which are used in food products, makeup and industrial coatings.",
      "\u201cThese are the raw materials that make everything,\u201d Ms. Gluth-Bohan said.",

      "Part of the impact is a result of where the storm landed. The Gulf Coast is home to refineries and plants that make all manner of industrial chemicals \u2014 a fact brought home last winter, when an intense freeze in the region knocked factories out of commission, causing product shortages that still endure.",
      "In Ida\u2019s wake, the plastics industry was girding for another jump in prices that were already at record highs.",
      "The Royale Group, which manufactures and distributes chemicals from its base near Wilmington, Del., buys only a small percentage of its supplies from plants on the Gulf of Mexico. But that is no comfort, said the company\u2019s chief executive, John Logue, because shortages of a single ingredient can be enough to halt production of many items.",
      "The auto industry has been severely constrained by a persistent shortage of computer chips. Similarly, Mr. Logue\u2019s company, which relies heavily on suppliers in China and India, has for weeks been unable to complete an order for a pharmaceutical company because it is waiting for one raw material.",

      "The Biden administration had already begun the lengthy process of undoing the policy, which President Donald J. Trump established in 2020 after farmers, real estate developers and fossil fuel producers complained that Obama-era rules had saddled them with onerous regulatory burdens. Mr. Trump\u2019s policy allowed the discharge of pollutants such as fertilizers, pesticides and industrial chemicals into smaller streams and wetlands.",

She warned of the \u201cpossibility of serious environmental harm\u201d if the Trump rule remained in place.",

      "The court ruling is the latest in a series of decisions by federal judges who have struck down Trump environmental policies after noting that the administration had frequently ignored the analysis of career federal scientists.",
      "In her order, Judge M\u00e1rquez wrote that the Trump water rule, which was jointly written by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers, appeared to disregard the E.P.A.\u2019s own scientific findings that indicate allowing pollution in small bodies of water could significantly harm the health of larger bodies of water and their ecosystems.",
      "A spokesman for the E.P.A. said that the agency was reviewing the ruling, but he declined to comment on it.",
      "Environmental groups celebrated the decision as a victory for clean water and scientific integrity.",
      "\u201cThis is a sensible, correct, legally accurate ruling,\u201d said Stuart Gillespie, an attorney for Earthjustice, an environmental group, who argued the case before the Arizona court on behalf of a half-dozen Native American groups, including the Pascua Yaqui Tribe, Quinault Indian Nation, Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, and Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin.",
      "\u201cIf you look at a watershed, particularly in the Southwest, you have all these tributaries and ephemeral streams that are linked together like capillaries,\u201d Mr. Gillespie said. \u201cAnd the Trump rule hurt all of us, because we are all downstream from those waters. The Trump rule was very extreme in eliminating protections on waters.\u201d",
      "Farming and construction groups are weighing an appeal.",
      "\u201cThis ruling casts uncertainty over farmers and ranchers across the country and threatens the progress they\u2019ve made to responsibly manage water and natural resources,\u201d said Zippy Duvall, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation. \u201cWe are reviewing the ruling to determine our next course of action.\u201d",
      "Kerry Lynch, a spokeswoman for the National Stone, Sand and Gravel Association, said her group was disappointed by the ruling and was \u201cevaluating the court\u2019s decision at this time.\u201d",
      "The Trump rule was a revision of an earlier rule promulgated by the Obama administration in 2015, known as Waters of the United States. That rule used the authority of the 1972 Clean Water Act to protect about 60 percent of the nation\u2019s waterways, including large bodies of water such as the Chesapeake Bay, the Mississippi River and the Puget Sound, as well as smaller headwaters, wetlands, seasonal streams and streams that run temporarily underground.",
      "Mr. Trump repealed the policy in 2019, calling it \u201cone of the most ridiculous regulations of all\u201d and claiming that his repeal caused farmers to weep in gratitude. One year later, the E.P.A. finalized his replacement policy, known as the Navigable Waters Protection Rule, which removed protections for more than half the nation\u2019s wetlands and hundreds of thousands of miles of upland streams by narrowing the definition of what constitutes a \u201cwater of the United States\u201d that merits federal protection.",
      "With both the Trump and Obama rules off the books, the nation\u2019s waters are now protected by a 1986 rule, which environmentalists, farmers and developers alike have bemoaned as so contradictory and poorly written that it resulted in thousands of legal disputes over water pollution that dragged on for years.",
      "\u201cIt was horribly confusing,\u201d Mark Ryan, a former E.P.A. lawyer, said. \u201cIt required a very complicated, time-consuming process\u201d to determine whether bodies of water qualified for federal protection from pollution.",
      "This summer, Michael S. Regan, the E.P.A. administrator, announced plans to begin crafting a new water protection rule that could be completed by next year."

    "content": [
      "An advanced H.I.V. vaccine trial in Africa has been shut down after data showed the shots offered only limited protection against the virus, researchers announced on Tuesday.",
      "The vaccine, made by Johnson & Johnson, is one in a long line found to offer little defense against H.I.V., one of medicine\u2019s most intractable adversaries. One candidate vaccine even increased the risk of infection.",
      "Another trial was halted last year in South Africa after a different experimental vaccine failed to offer sufficient protection. Some 1.5 million people were infected with H.I.V. worldwide in 2020, and 38 million are living with the infection.",
      "Scientists were dismayed by the most recent failure.",
      "\u201cI should be used to it by now, but you\u2019re never used to it \u2014 you still put your heart and soul into it,\u201d said Dr. Glenda Gray, the principal investigator of the trial and chair of the South African Medical Research Council. Dr. Gray has been working to develop an H.I.V. vaccine for more than 15 years.",
      "Entirely new approaches may be needed. This month, Moderna announced that it would test a vaccine based on the mRNA platform used to devise the company\u2019s coronavirus vaccine.",
      "The trial, called Imbokodo, tested an experimental vaccine in 2,600 young women deemed at high risk of H.I.V. infection in five sub-Saharan African countries. Women and girls accounted for almost two-thirds of new H.I.V. infections in the region last year.",
      "The trial was funded by Johnson & Johnson, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the National Institutes of Health.",
      "The vaccine relied on an adenovirus called Ad26, modified to carry fragments of four H.I.V. subtypes into the body in hopes of provoking an immune response that might defend against infection.",
      "Mitchell Warren, executive director of AVAC, an advocacy group that lobbies for AIDS prevention and treatment, said the cancellation of the trial was a \u201creality check\u201d amid excitement about new vaccine technologies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a grand reminder that H.I.V. is a pathogen unlike any other in its complexity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know the platform worked, but what do we put in it? Because this virus is infecting the exact same immune system that we\u2019re trying to boost with a vaccine.\u201d",
      "Participants in the Imbokodo trial, which began in 2017, were given two initial shots and two boosters over the course of a year. Researchers tracked the numbers of new infections in the placebo and vaccine groups from the seventh month (one month after the third vaccination) through the 24th month.",
      "Over two years, 63 of 1,109 participants who received the placebo were infected with H.I.V., compared with 51 of 1,079 participants who received the vaccine \u2014 giving the vaccine an efficacy rate of 25 percent.",
      "Earlier studies, including one carried out in Thailand, had indicated that the kind of antibodies this vaccine provoked might be sufficient to offer good protection from H.I.V. for at least an initial period of time.",
      "\u201cBut in South Africa, the higher rates of H.I.V. incidence means you need something much more potent,\u201d Dr. Gray said. \u201cThe kind of immune responses that were induced were just not enough to stop the high attack rates we see in Africa.\u201d",
      "When the disappointing data showed a low efficacy rate, guidelines set up before the trial dictated it should be shut down. A vaccine that offered only 25 percent protection risked giving women a \u201cfalse sense of security,\u201d Dr. Gray said.",
      "But a parallel trial that uses a different iteration of this vaccine will continue, Johnson & Johnson said. It is being tested on men who have sex with men and transgender people, in eight countries including Poland, Brazil and the United States.",
      "That study, called Mosaico, is testing the vaccine against different subtypes of H.I.V. in different populations, and could produce different efficacy results.",
      "Dr. Gray said that the lesson from the failed trial lies in figuring out why it worked for the 25 percent of people who were protected and not for the others, and then trying to translate those clues into a recipe for a future vaccine."

      "Whether they work on or off Capitol Hill, Washingtonians tend to plan their summer schedules around that of Congress, meaning that during the weeks preceding the lawmakers\u2019 return (this year beginning in mid-September), the nation\u2019s capital is far less crowded than usual. For visitors, a largely empty city means the possibility of scoring reservations at the most exclusive restaurants and strolling past the glowing Lincoln Memorial at night without joggers ruining your photo op.",
      "Although the pandemic caused tourism to plummet last year (Washington lost an estimated $4.9 billion from March 2020 to December 2020, according to tourism officials), interest in the nation\u2019s capital is on the upswing. According to the Destination DC tourism organization, domestic visitation is up 50 percent compared to last year, with travel booking sites like Priceline showing a 51 percent increase in hotel searches for third-quarter travel, and a 120 percent increase in summer bookings on the short-term rental platform, Guesty.",
      "The city is welcoming the renewed interest with open arms. After a year marred not only by a pandemic, but also by a contentious presidential election and an attack on the Capitol building, to say that anxiety has been high would be an understatement. Even the most jaded Washingtonian was glad to see the National Mall dotted with neon T-shirt-wearing tourist groups as the Smithsonian\u2019s collection of museums and attractions returned to prepandemic hours.",
      "Although restaurants and attractions remain fully open, coronavirus cases, driven by the Delta variant, rose steadily throughout the summer. On Aug. 19 cases had increased 79 percent over the previous 14 days. The indoor mask mandate was reinstated on July 31 for everyone over age 2, regardless of vaccination status. Fortunately, between public murals and modern art displays, annual festivals and hiking and biking in Rock Creek Park, there\u2019s no shortage of things to do outdoors.",
      "Alongside a slate of new programming like the return of live music to the Sculpture Garden at the National Gallery of Art and the 50th anniversary season of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which kicks off this September, the walkable, off-the-mall neighborhoods of Logan Circle, West End/Foggy Bottom and Dupont Circle are showing off new restaurants with tons of outdoor dining, shops and galleries.",
      "While the string of buzzy restaurants and fashion brands lining Logan Circle\u2019s 14th Street corridor is a big draw, the unlikely gem of this neighborhood is the Barbie Pond. Located on Q Street N.W., the themed display of Barbie dolls surrounding the front yard fountain of a private residence row home has delighted passers-by and 25,000 fans on Instagram since 2014. The last year has only increased its celebrity, thanks to scenes like a group of Kens raising a rainbow flag Iwo Jima-style for Pride Month, a preinauguration scene of the Capitol building dotted with dozens of Kamala Harris Barbies, and a vaccination summer scene complete with pool floats.",
      "Back on 14th Street, nearly every restaurant has an outdoor dining area, or you can opt for a spot like Garden District for beer and barbecue or the soon-to-open Aslin Beer Company beer garden. After all that drinking and dining, you may want to sign up for an outdoor yoga class with Flow Yoga Center, which has partnered with Milk Bar\u2019s D.C. flagship on 15th Street to host classes in their spacious parking lot during the pandemic. The concert venue Black Cat has reopened after shuttering for more than a year, and has, among other events, a \u201cBeyonc\u00e9 vs. Rihanna\u201d dance party scheduled Sept. 4. Proof of vaccination is required for entry.",
      "Next door is Pigments and Oil Shop, a pop-up gallery highlighting both emerging and established D.C.-based artists. You\u2019ll find screen prints of D.C. scenes by Michael Crossett, photography from last summer\u2019s protests against racial injustice by Gayatri Malhotra and mixed-media pieces by Anna Davis. Hours are 4 to 8 p.m., Thursday through Sunday or by appointment. The visual arts organization Transformer also hosts solo and group exhibitions from D.C.-based emerging artists in its gallery space on 14th and P, ranging from photography to performance art. Hours are 1 to 6 p.m., Thursday through Saturday, or by appointment.",
      "Though not new, a sobering but necessary addition to Logan Circle is at The Outrage, where the five-year-old activism hub and fashion boutique (offering gear supporting nearly every social justice issue you can think of) has transformed a portion of its space into a memorial for local coronavirus victims. The event space at the back of the shop is now the Covid-19 Memorial Project, featuring photo displays and stories of loved ones lost.",
      "Anchored by George Washington University and the U.S. Department of State, the next-door neighborhoods of Foggy Bottom and West End generally don\u2019t rank high on D.C.\u2019s must-see list. But don\u2019t skip these riverside neighborhoods, with their tree-lined streets dotted with embassies and global headquarters, and home to both the illustrious Kennedy Center and the infamous Watergate complex (which is now a luxury hotel with a rooftop bar that offers one of the best views in Washington). A few months before the pandemic, the Kennedy Center opened REACH, a 4.6-acre annex with an expansive lawn for film viewings and live performances, a river pavilion with a reflecting pool and outdoor deck, a grove of 35 ginkgo trees planted in honor of John F. Kennedy, the 35th president, and an outdoor food and wine garden.",
      "May 2020 brought the Yours Truly D.C. hotel to the former Wink hotel space. The result is a chill and bohemian vibe complete with macram\u00e9 wall hangings and lush Bird of Paradise plants in the open-plan, living room-style lobby that\u2019s a great hangout spot for both hotel guests and visitors. Tucked in the back corner is El Donut Shoppe, a new-and-used vinyl boutique and Groom Guy, a barbershop meets self-care studio for men inspired by the Black-owned salons of the early 1900s. On less humid days, floor-to-ceiling windows open to the hotel\u2019s front patio, or you can opt for food and drinks on the back deck, which is draped with multicolored string lights. Mercy Me, the hotel\u2019s \u201csorta South American Cafe\u201d serves up breakfast tacos and Colombian mochas by day, and banana leaf-steamed rockfish and grass-fed Argentine steak by night. Dinner for two is around $90.",
      "A block and a half away is Imperfecto, the newest offering from the chef Enrique Limardo and Ezequiel V\u00e1zquez-Ger, the co-owners of the pan-Latin restaurant Seven Reasons. Imperfecto\u2019s daily menu may include the Moussaka Cigar, made with crispy phyllo dough, smoked eggplant, ground lamb and feta-manchego cream, and the impossibly tender Spanish fried octopus alongside sweet potatoes, Amazonian chimichurri and inky olive mayonnaise. Dinner for two with drinks is around $170, while the 10-plus-course Chef\u2019s Table menu starts at $175. Reservations are recommended, especially for sidewalk seating.",
      "Standing just across from the site of Western Market, built in 1802 and part of the French engineer Pierre L\u2019Enfant\u2019s original plan to create three markets for D.C., is the soon-to-open Western Market food hall. The 12,300-square-foot space will have a soft opening around Labor Day with four to five vendors, including Shuko hot dogs from the Guatemalan street food outpost Nim Ali. A back patio will offer socially distanced dining, movie nights and live music. A full opening with more than a dozen vendors will happen next year.",
      "Dupont Circle is historically known as the hub of L.G.B.T.Q. life in Washington, packed with lively nightlife venues, trendy bistros and longstanding independent shops like Kramers bookstore. In the middle of it all is Dupont Circle itself, a prime spot for people watching, reading or playing chess next to the massive marble fountain. Dupont rose to the Covid challenge, opening streetside dining on the 1500 block of 19th Street and 1600 block of 20th Street, where diners can soak up the energy of one of D.C.\u2019s most vibrant neighborhoods.",
      "The Boston-based Israeli bakery chain, Tatte Bakery & Cafe, opened its second D.C. location this past October, bringing outdoor dining space, an all-day menu of spicy shakshuka, crunchy seared halloumi salads and Greek-style pancakes. While the housemade pastries may be your initial draw to the sun-drenched, subway-tiled space, don\u2019t skip the coffee menu, especially the Tatte House Latte with honey halvah and cardamom.",
      "One block over on 19th Street is Swingers, one of the most intriguing new openings in the Dupont area in quite a while. The self-described \u201ccrazy golf\u201d establishment is 20,000 square feet of 1920s English clubhouse-style mini-golf for grown ups. Think: multiple cocktail bars, local D.J.s, a mini food hall and two of the most entertaining, albeit challenging, nine-hole mini-golf courses around. Opened June 18, it\u2019s the first location this side of the Atlantic Ocean, after the success of two London ventures, with another slated to open in New York in 2022. Tickets start at $19 per person. If you\u2019d rather just hang out and skip golfing, there\u2019s no entry fee.",
      "When Pierre L\u2019Enfant laid out his design for Washington, D.C., in 1791, it featured 16th Street as a European-style boulevard leading straight to the White House. Rumor has it, when L\u2019Enfant was dismissed by George Washington (apparently storming off and taking his plans with him), the assistant surveyor, Benjamin Banneker, recreated the plan for the city from memory. Although details are fuzzy, Banneker is a celebrated innovator in African American history and the muse behind the new Kimpton Banneker Hotel on 16th Street. Come for the public artwork, especially the lobby mural by Victor Ekpuk, a D.C.-based Nigerian-American artist, as well as an abstract portrait of Banneker by Rob Matthews and works from the nonprofit Black Artists of D.C.",

    "title": "G.O.P. Governors Fight Mandates as the Party\u2019s Covid Politics Harden",
    "content": [
      "As a new coronavirus wave accelerated by the Delta variant spreads across the United States, many Republican governors have taken sweeping action to combat what they see as an even more urgent danger posed by the pandemic: the threat to personal freedom.",
      "In Florida, Ron DeSantis has prevented local governments and school districts from enacting mask mandates and battled in court over compliance. In Texas, Greg Abbott has followed a similar playbook, renewing an order last week to ban vaccine mandates.",
      "And in South Dakota, Kristi Noem, who like Mr. DeSantis and Mr. Abbott is a potential 2024 candidate for president, has made her blanket opposition to lockdowns and mandates a key selling point. Arriving by horseback and carrying the American flag, she advertised the state\u2019s recent Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, which drew half a million people, as a beacon of liberty.",
      "Ms. Noem brushed aside criticism from Democrats and public health experts about the gathering, which was followed by a local Covid spike, saying on Fox News that the left was \u201caccusing us of embracing death when we\u2019re just allowing people to make personal choices.\u201d",
      "The actions of Republican governors, some of the leading stewards of the country\u2019s response to the virus, reveal how the politics of the party\u2019s base have hardened when it comes to curbing Covid. As some Republican-led states, including Florida, confront their most serious outbreaks yet, even rising death totals are being treated as less politically damaging than imposing coronavirus mandates of almost any stripe.",
      "\u201cFreedom is good policy and good politics,\u201d Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican and ally of Mr. Abbott\u2019s who has introduced federal legislation to end mask decrees and to forbid federal vaccine passports, said in an interview.",
      "Mr. DeSantis has become a symbolic face of the battle, as President Biden has urged Republican governors opposed to mandates to at least \u201cget out of the way.\u201d This week, Mr. DeSantis\u2019s education commissioner withheld funds from two school districts that made masks mandatory.",
      "Most top Republicans, including every Republican governor, have been vaccinated and have encouraged others to do so. But most have also stopped short of supporting inoculation requirements and have opposed masking requirements.",
      "In many ways, Republican leaders are simply following Republican voters.",
      "Skepticism about masks, vaccines and the rules governing them is increasingly intertwined with the cultural issues that dominate the modern Republican Party. The fear over losing \u201cmedical freedom\u201d has become part of the broader worry that \u201ccancel culture\u201d is coming for conservatives\u2019 way of life.",
      "And while opposing pandemic edicts is a limited-government stance, the forceful approach of governors is at odds with the long-held principle of local control, making it the latest Republican Party orthodoxy to be cast aside since the beginning of the Trump era, along with free trade and limited spending.",
      "The intensifying conservative mistrust of the news media and opposition to the directives of elite institutions and experts \u2014 Dr. Anthony S. Fauci is now so reviled by some that Mr. DeSantis sold merchandise saying \u201cDon\u2019t Fauci My Florida\u201d \u2014 have cleaved the country into two factions guided by alternative sets of beliefs.",
      "One outlier among Republican governors is Larry Hogan, a moderate who leads Democratic-dominated Maryland. He recently required that hospital and nursing home employees be vaccinated.",
      "\u201cFrankly, it\u2019s confusing to me as to why some of my colleagues are mandating why you can\u2019t wear masks, or mandating that businesses can\u2019t make their own decisions about vaccines, or mandating that school systems can\u2019t make decisions for themselves,\u201d Mr. Hogan said in an interview. \u201cAnd then they\u2019re talking about freedom? It just doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d",
      "The pandemic, public health officials say, is now largely one of the unvaccinated, and the virus is raging particularly in conservative states with far lower inoculation rates and more relaxed attitudes toward group gatherings. Of the 10 states with the most cases per capita in recent days, nine voted Republican in last year\u2019s presidential race and nine are led by Republican governors, according to The New York Times coronavirus database.",
      "Republican leaders\u2019 posture, particularly on keeping schools from requiring masks, does not appear popular across the wider electorate. In Florida, a Quinnipiac poll released last week found that 60 percent of residents supported compulsory masks in schools.",
      "But among Republicans, that figure was inverted: 72 percent of Mr. DeSantis\u2019s party said they opposed universal masking requirements in schools. The poll showed that a plurality of Republicans in the state also opposed a mask requirement for health care workers, a measure that is popular among independents.",
      "\u201cMany Republicans are out on an island by themselves,\u201d said Whit Ayres, a veteran G.O.P. pollster. \u201cIt may be a safe political place for some primary electorates at the moment. But ultimately you have to win a general election.\u201d",
      "Governors nationwide almost uniformly reject the idea that political considerations have shaped their Covid policies. \u201cPolitics have played no role,\u201d said Ian Fury, a spokesman for Ms. Noem.",
      "The offices of Mr. DeSantis, Mr. Abbott, Ms. Noem and other Republican governors did not make them available for comment. But advisers to multiple Republican governors said the widespread distribution of vaccines had changed the governing calculus when it came to masks and shutdowns. Both Mr. DeSantis and Mr. Abbott have focused on opening antibody treatment sites for those who contract the virus.",
      "As Florida became the first state to reach a new peak in deaths since vaccines became freely available, Mr. DeSantis has remained steadfast in keeping schools from requiring masks without a parental opt-out.",
      "\u201cWe say unequivocally no to lockdowns, no to school closures, no to restrictions and no to mandates,\u201d Mr. DeSantis said at a conservative conference in July.",
      "These choices by governors carry a range of risks.",
      "One Republican strategist privately lamented, only half-jokingly, that the party was going to kill off part of its own base with its vaccine hesitancy. Former President Donald J. Trump recently told donors at a New York Republican Party fund-raiser that he hoped his supporters would get vaccinated because \u201cwe need our people,\u201d according to two attendees.",
      "Even Mr. Trump is not immune from blowback, however. He received a rare rebuke from his base at an August rally in Alabama after he urged people to get vaccinated. \u201cTake the vaccines,\u201d he said. \u201cI did it. It\u2019s good.\u201d",
      "Some in the crowd began to jeer; Mr. Trump appeared to soften his stance.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s OK, that\u2019s all right,\u201d he said. \u201cYou got your freedoms, but I happened to take the vaccine.\u201d",
      "Mr. Trump\u2019s political operation has clearly assessed where his base stands. \u201cFREEDOM PASSPORTS > VACCINE PASSPORTS,\u201d read one recent fund-raising text, selling $45 American flag shirts that declare, \u201cThis is my freedom passport.\u201d",
      "In Arkansas, Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, saw his party\u2019s pushback firsthand on a 16-stop tour to promote vaccination.",
      "Mr. Hutchinson signed a law this spring banning mask mandates, but with cases rising again this month, he said he regretted it. In Siloam Springs, he was pelted with questions from frustrated constituents, including one woman who told him that she had been \u201cpraying that God himself will step in so that Christians are not forced by their employers and a mandate to get the vaccine.\u201d",
      "\u201cYet even if God does not, I will not bow,\u201d she said to raucous cheers.",
      "Then there is Ms. Noem, who last month accused other Republican governors of \u201cpretending they didn\u2019t shut down their states, that they didn\u2019t close their regions, that they didn\u2019t mandate masks.\u201d The remarks were widely interpreted to be aimed at potential 2024 rivals.",
      "Mr. Cruz, who ran for president in 2016 and could again in 2024, predicted a reckoning for politicians, including Republicans, who had embraced pandemic edicts. \u201cThere\u2019s a range of politicians in terms of how long they shut things down,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my view, the shorter the better. But that will certainly be a legitimate topic for discussion and debate.\u201d",
      "Mr. Ayres, the Republican pollster, said that governors trying to control the virus policies of schools, employers and local officials were breaking with years of tradition on free enterprise and local control.",
      "\u201cLiberty has never meant the freedom to threaten the health\u201d of others, Mr. Ayres said. \u201cThat is a perversion of the definition of liberty and freedom.\u201d",
      "Some governors who imposed mandates and lockdowns last year have even been targeted by state legislators who want to trim their powers.",
      "In Ohio, the G.O.P.-controlled Legislature overrode a veto by Gov. Mike DeWine, a fellow Republican, of legislation that reined in his administration\u2019s emergency powers to manage the pandemic. After requiring masks to be worn last year in schools, he has not renewed the order this fall.",
      "Mr. DeWine, who drew national attention for his fast and forceful response to Covid in early 2020, now faces a 2022 primary challenge from Jim Renacci, a former congressman. Mr. Renacci said the governor\u2019s handling of the virus was \u201ca big part\u201d of his bid.",
      "He said Mr. DeWine had now \u201cgone quiet\u201d on mandates because \u201che realizes what he did the first time did not make Republicans happy.\u201d",
      "A spokesman for Mr. DeWine said the need for mandates had changed since vaccines became freely available.",
      "The most severe Covid outbreaks have been most concentrated in the South, and the Republican governors of Alabama and Mississippi have largely embraced the no-mandate ethos even as cases have climbed to new heights.",
      "Gov. Tate Reeves of Mississippi renewed an emergency declaration in mid-August but set clear boundaries: \u201cThere will be no lockdowns and there will be no statewide mandates,\u201d he said.",
      "The same week, two field hospitals were installed in the parking lots of Mississippi medical centers."

      "The financial outlook for Social Security is eroding more quickly than previously expected, as the coronavirus pandemic has drained government revenues and put additional strain on one of the nation\u2019s most important social safety net programs. The overall finances for Medicare, however, are expected to hold steady, though the health program is still forecast to face financial pressure in the coming years.",
      "Annual government reports released on Tuesday on the solvency of the programs underscored the questions about their long-term viability at a time when a wave of baby boomers are retiring and the economy faces ongoing uncertainty as variants of the coronavirus surge. The United States economy already faces soaring federal debt levels in the coming decades, but both Democrats and Republicans have been wary of making significant structural reforms to the popular programs.",
      "\u201cHaving strong Social Security and Medicare programs is essential in order to ensure a secure retirement for all Americans, especially for our most vulnerable populations,\u201d Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said in a statement. \u201cThe Biden-Harris administration is committed to safeguarding these programs and ensuring they continue to deliver economic security and health care to older Americans.\u201d",
      "Senior administration officials said that the long-term effects of the pandemic on the programs are unclear. The actuaries were forced to make assumptions about how long Covid would continue to cause unusual patterns of hospitalizations and deaths and whether it would contribute to long-term disabilities among survivors.",
      "The Social Security Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund will now be depleted in 2033, a year earlier than previously projected, according to the report. At that time, the trust fund will run out of reserves and the program will be insolvent, with new tax revenues failing to cover scheduled payments. The report estimated that 76 percent of scheduled benefits will be able to be paid out unless Congress changes the rules to allow full payouts.",
      "The Disability Insurance Trust Fund is now expected to be depleted by 2057, which is eight years earlier than previously thought, at which time 91 percent of benefits will be paid.",
      "Medicare\u2019s finances are effectively holding steady. While tax revenue for the Medicare program did decline as a result of the Covid-related recession, Medicare also ended up spending less money than usual last year, as people avoided elective care.",
      "Medicare\u2019s hospital trust fund is projected to be unable to pay all of its bills beginning in 2026. This estimate is similar to those from Medicare\u2019s trustees in recent years. Fixing that gap now could be achieved by increasing the Medicare payroll tax rate from 2.9 percent to 3.67 percent or by reducing Medicare spending by 16 percent each year, the report notes.",
      "But the report highlighted that the official estimate may be unrealistically optimistic. If certain policies set to expire in the next 10 years are extended, or if other expected policy changes occur, the projections would look substantially more worrying.",
      "Long term, the actuaries said they did not think Covid-19 itself would have substantial influence on Medicare spending on hospital care. On the one hand, the death of many vulnerable, older Americans from the virus may reduce future spending they would otherwise have received. On the other, the actuaries expect that some people may have additional health care needs from the syndrome known as long Covid.",
      "The actuaries declined to make any estimates on the effect of Aduhelm, a very expensive Alzheimer\u2019s treatment that was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The report said that officials were waiting for Medicare to issue guidance on how the drug will be covered before making any calculations. The drug could represent tens of billions of dollars in spending each year.",
      "Democrats in Congress are considering a host of changes to the Medicare program, such as adding new benefits, including coverage for dental, hearing and vision care. While these changes are expected to influence Medicare\u2019s overall finances, none of them are likely to have major effects on the trust fund, which covers only hospital care.",
      "\u201cMedicare trust fund solvency is an incredibly important, longstanding issue, and we are committed to working with Congress to continue building a vibrant, equitable, and sustainable Medicare program,\u201d said Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services."

      "Laura hit Lake Charles, La., a city of about 76,000 people, on Aug. 27, 2020, and the one-year anniversary on Friday was an agonizing marker of how long many people were forced to live in hotels, camper trailers or homes that were barely inhabitable because of the storm\u2019s toll. Elected officials also noted the lack of federal support that they believe the city still needs.",
      "\u201cThank you for being tougher than you should need to be,\u201d Nic Hunter, the mayor, said in a post on his Facebook page.",
      "Laura was just the first of a series of weather crises to hit Lake Charles and the southwestern corner of Louisiana over the past year. Hurricane Delta cut a similar path through the state roughly six weeks later. That was followed by a winter storm that swept over the region, causing pipes to burst in homes and knocking out water systems. Then, heavy rainfall unleashed flooding in May.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m a little nervous,\u201d said Le-Ann Williams, 30, as she cooked breakfast and watched the forecast in her New Orleans East apartment.",
      "The roads west and east of New Orleans were parking lots for much of Saturday as tens of thousands of people tried to make their way out of the storm\u2019s predicted path. It took Robert Green Sr. 16 hours to get to Houston from New Orleans on Saturday, ordinarily a five-hour drive.",
      "At the same time, thousands more decided to stay put.",
      "Shawn Kelly meant to leave. He does not have a car, so he booked a flight out. But by Saturday afternoon, he got a notification that the flight had been canceled, and social media posts showed hourslong lines at the airport.",
      "So the stage was set: He\u2019d try to ride out Hurricane Ida in his parents\u2019 home in the Uptown area of New Orleans \u2014 the same place where he and his family tried to ride out Katrina in 2005, when he was 10 years old. Back then, the family wound up having to be rescued, a scenario he hopes won\u2019t be repeated.",
      "\u201cI wish I could leave, because the next couple days without power are going to be the worst part,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \u201cI\u2019m worried about the aftermath, more so than the storm, because that was the thing with Katrina; it was the aftermath. I\u2019m always worried about what comes after.\u201d",

      "The answer is \u201cpost-storm evacuation,\u201d said Collin Arnold, the city\u2019s director of emergency preparedness. Urban search-and-rescue teams were prepared, and buses have been placed on high ground, ready to carry people out of town on Monday, once the storm blows through.",
      "Older people in the city often talk proudly of never having evacuated, even in the face of serious storms like Hurricane Betsy in 1965. But Mr. Arnold said the plans for post-storm rescues were not an endorsement of that bravado, just an acknowledgment that fast-moving storms like Ida may leave little time for evacuation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not intentionally choosing it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s changes in the climate that are doing it to us.\u201d",
      "Evacuation is a crucial part of the disaster plan in a city where one in five households lack cars. But to be effective, the evacuation process should begin 72 hours before a storm hits. And Ida, a sprinter of a storm, was little more than a tropical disturbance in the Caribbean on Thursday afternoon, when Mayor LaToya Cantrell would have had to issue the order.",

For a team of Times journalists, the process of answering that question underscored the importance of two storytelling basics \u2014 rely on experts and think of the audience \u2014 and resulted in an interactive article in July that provided a broader understanding of deaf culture.",
      "\u201cOne of our priorities was to show our readers the diversity of experiences and backgrounds that exist in the deaf world,\u201d Ilaria Parogni, a senior editor who wrote the article, said. \u201cDelving into name signs allowed us to tap into that.\u201d",
      "The challenge began when The Times set out to learn how Vice President Kamala Harris received her name sign (also known as a sign name).",
      "Name signs are an important component of \u201ccapital D Deaf\u201d culture, a term used by some deaf people to indicate that they embrace deafness as a cultural identity. The signs consist of gestures that can reflect facets of an individual\u2019s personality, physical features or background.",
      "A group of five women had collaborated on a name sign for Vice President Harris after agreeing that her Black and Indian heritage should inform her name.",
      "Scott Reinhard, a graphics editor, originally pitched the idea to the Culture desk and suggested talking to the women about how they arrived at the name sign. Ms. Parogni and Alicia DeSantis, a deputy editor for visuals and multimedia, organized a two-hour video call with the five women in February. Ms. Parogni has family members who have experienced hearing loss and had previously written stories about on-screen representation of deaf and hard-of-hearing characters on television.",
      "But, she said, \u201cI\u2019m always conscious that I\u2019m not a member of the Deaf community.\u201d So she consulted ASL teachers throughout the project, asking for advice on sensitive subjects like the best way to indicate that someone is speaking ASL in an article. She also shared insights with the team that she gained from her experiences reporting and researching the subject.",
      "The Times worked with several interpreters throughout the project, consulting with an interpreting agency that assisted in selecting translators who would cater to the needs of people from different backgrounds. \u201cDiversity was important to us,\u201d Ms. Parogni said. \u201cBehind the scenes, too.\u201d",
      "Ms. Parogni said that it quickly became clear to everyone that there was a much bigger story to be told beyond Ms. Harris \u2014 about the history of name signs and their significance to deaf people.",
      "It was clear, too, that video, graphics and design would have to be integrated in order to tell the story in a fully accessible way. Overall, more than a dozen journalists worked on the project, including Deborah Leiderman, a senior editor who was involved from the beginning. She helped produce the project and edited the written component. Ms. Leiderman also had worked with Ms. Parogni on previous articles about deaf people.",
      "Meg Felling, an assistant video editor, edited the videos and created subtitles based on the interpreters\u2019 translations. She did not know ASL, so she looked up signs to avoid cutting someone off in the middle of a sentence as she was making edits. Still, there were questions the team had to work through.",
      "\u201cInterpreting isn\u2019t an exact science,\u201d Ms. Parogni said. \u201cSo, for a certain word, we\u2019d often have to go back to the source to be 100 percent sure.\u201d",
      "Amanda Morris, a hard-of-hearing woman raised by two deaf parents who is fluent in ASL, offered additional support when she joined The Times in June as a disability reporting fellow.",
      "\u201cIt made a huge difference,\u201d Ms. Parogni said. \u201cNot just to have someone who could look at subtitles and make sure the ASL was right, but also confirm we were approaching the project in the right way.\u201d",
      "Ms. Morris helped make a few of the subtitles more accurate. \u201cSigns can look very similar,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to use multiple context clues such as facial expressions and body language to figure out what a person is saying.\u201d",
      "The team also took her recommendation to make a key detail in the story more prominent: Name signs cannot be assigned by a hearing person. And Ms. Morris reinforced a direction team members had decided on earlier to make the article accessible to visually impaired readers by including video transcripts \u2014 invisible descriptions of videos on a page that are read aloud to blind or visually impaired users on a screen reader.",
      "Ms. Morris said she hopes all of these efforts will help educate readers about deaf people and show \u201cthat sign language has deep cultural significance.\u201d"

      "It\u2019s been a dizzying few weeks for meteorologists who monitored several named storms that formed in quick succession in the Atlantic, bringing stormy weather, flooding and damaging winds to different parts of the United States and the Caribbean.",
      "Tropical Storm Fred made landfall on Aug. 16 in the Florida Panhandle. As Fred moved across the southeast, it brought heavy rains and touched off several tornadoes. At least five people were killed after flash floods wiped out homes in Western North Carolina in the wake of the storm.",
      "Grace formed in the eastern Caribbean on Aug. 14, the same day a 7.2-magnitude earthquake rocked Haiti\u2019s western peninsula. The storm quickly moved west as the country struggled to free people trapped in rubble, dumping at least 10 inches of rain. Grace then made another landfall on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico, bringing more heavy rain, power failures and hundreds of evacuations.",
      "Another landfall, on the eastern coast of Mexico\u2019s mainland, left at least eight people dead.",
      "And Henri formed on Aug. 16 as a tropical storm off the East Coast of the United States. It strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane but was downgraded before making landfall in Rhode Island, sparing the region the worst of what had been predicted. It thrashed the Northeast with fierce winds and torrential rain, knocking out power to more than 140,000 households from New Jersey to Maine.",
      "Ana became the first named storm of the season on May 23, making this the seventh year in a row that a named storm developed in the Atlantic before the official start of the season on June 1.",
      "The links between hurricanes and climate change are becoming more apparent. A warming planet could expect to have stronger hurricanes over time, and a higher incidence of the most powerful storms \u2014 though the overall number of storms could drop, because factors like stronger wind shear could keep weaker storms from forming.",
      "Hurricanes are also becoming wetter because of more water vapor in the warmer atmosphere; scientists have suggested storms like Hurricane Harvey in 2017 produced far more rain than they would have without the human effects on climate. Also, rising sea levels are contributing to higher storm surge \u2014 the most destructive element of tropical cyclones.",
      "In May, scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast that there would be 13 to 20 named storms this year, six to 10 of which would be hurricanes, and three to five major hurricanes of Category 3 or higher in the Atlantic. In early August, in a midseason update to the forecast, they continued to warn that this year\u2019s hurricane season would be an above average one, suggesting a busy end to the season.",
      "Matthew Rosencrans, of the NOAA, said that an updated forecast suggested that there would be 15 to 21 named storms, including seven to 10 hurricanes, by the end of the season on Nov. 30. Julian is the 10th named storm of 2021.",
      "Last year, there were 30 named storms, including six major hurricanes, forcing meteorologists to exhaust the alphabet for the second time and move to using Greek letters.",
      "It was the highest number of storms on record, surpassing the 28 from 2005, and included the second-highest number of hurricanes reported in history."

    "content": [
      "NEW ORLEANS \u2014 Hurricane Ida howled into Louisiana on Sunday with powerful winds and dangerously high storm surges, lashing coastal communities, battering New Orleans and putting the city\u2019s system for resisting catastrophic flooding to its biggest test since Hurricane Katrina.",
      "Arriving 16 years to the day since that storm devastated New Orleans, Hurricane Ida sent residents fleeing east and west out of its path on jammed roadways across Louisiana. Those who remained \u2014 by choice or by circumstance of the fast-arriving storm \u2014 endured maximum winds that reached 150 miles an hour, just shy of Category 5 intensity.",
      "The storm made landfall shortly before noon, earlier than expected and only days after it became a named hurricane. Its rapid strengthening amazed meteorologists and left officials and Gulf Coast residents with little time to prepare.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the strongest storms to make landfall here in modern times,\u201d Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana said in a briefing on Sunday afternoon.",
      "President Biden, speaking at the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s headquarters on Sunday, said that \u201cthe devastation is likely to be immense\u201d and promised that \u201cas soon as the storm passes, we\u2019re going to have the country\u2019s full might behind the rescue and recovery.\u201d",
      "White-capped waves appeared on the Mississippi River as winds uprooted trees, tore roofs from buildings and knocked out power for hundreds of thousands across the state. Storm surges inundated areas of the coast from Burns Point, west of New Orleans, to around Biloxi, Miss. Floodwaters threatened inland communities such as greater Baton Rouge, in Louisiana.",
      "Winds of up to 82 miles per hour, with gusts of up to 138 miles per hour, spread inland all through the afternoon. Ida weakened to a Category 2 storm by late Sunday night with maximum winds of 105 miles per hour.",
      "By nightfall, Entergy, a major power company in Louisiana, texted residents that all of New Orleans was without power because of \u201ccatastrophic transmission damage.\u201d",
      "With the brunt of the storm passing through the city Sunday night, it was impossible to determine the full extent of destruction and potential loss of life. But scenes and reports from across the region were not promising.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been an experience, the roughest I\u2019ve ever seen it,\u201d said Anthony Rodrigue, 62, who has never evacuated his home in Houma, La., for a storm. \u201cThere\u2019s so many sheets of rain, I can\u2019t even see across the street from my house.\u201d",
      "The National Hurricane Center said that by Monday, the storm will have drenched the Gulf Coast with an estimated eight to 16 inches of rain, and perhaps as much as 20 inches in some places.  ",
      "Heavy rainfall and flooding were expected across several states into the week as the hurricane and its remnants moved toward the Northeast.",
      "In a sign of the storm\u2019s strength, water overtopped at least one levee in Plaquemines Parish, southeast of New Orleans, by late afternoon. Officials had expected some water to rise above levees, cautioning that it was not a sign of their failure. Still, local officials urged nearby residents to \u201cseek higher ground immediately.\u201d",
      "Hurricane Ida presented a second severe crisis to a state already in the throes of one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in the nation.",
      "Covid-19 deaths in Louisiana have climbed to their highest levels of the coronavirus pandemic. Hospitals, already filled or near capacity by a surge of Covid-19 patients, scrambled on Sunday to manage operations during the storm as evacuations were no longer possible. The storm blew portions of the roof off one hospital outside New Orleans, Lady of the Sea General Hospital.",
      "New Orleans suspended its emergency medical services shortly before noon because of high winds, saying in a statement that operations would resume \u201conce it is safe.\u201d",
      "\u201cNobody should be expecting that tonight a first responder is going to be able to answer a call for help,\u201d the governor said, underscoring that residents who had not already left needed to stay in their homes.",
      "Officials have expressed confidence that efforts to harden levees and flood systems around New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina would be enough to hold back storm surges. But, the governor said, the same might not be the case in other areas of the state, where the infrastructure \u201cis not built to that same standard.\u201d",
      "Inside the French Quarter, Kisha Shorter held out hope that the storm would blow over quickly, even as the wind rattled outside.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been real disrespectful,\u201d she said of the wind. \u201cEven though I have my storm shutters bracketed closed, it still was shaking and blowing.\u201d",
      "Ms. Shorter, who lives above the bar she tends, remained hopeful that she could open the bar late Sunday after the storm passed. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how it goes,\u201d she said.",
      "Even before it arrived, the storm stirred painful reminders in New Orleans of the death and devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which left psychological scars that still run deep in the city. The storm killed 1,833 people, inflicted more than $100 billion in damage and submerged large stretches of New Orleans, leading to scenes of suffering that horrified the nation and stunned the world.",
      "The trajectory and strength of Hurricane Ida presented a high-stakes test of the levees, flood walls, pumps and gates that were reinforced around New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.",
      "The city is now protected by a storm-surge barrier so large that it can be seen from space, and a network of drainage canals have gates at Lake Pontchartrain that keep water from entering. The soil along 50 miles of levees was also removed, mixed with cement and put back, reinforcing each protective wall.",
      "Officials believe hundreds of thousands of people left the metropolitan area in advance of the storm, but many people remained, sheltering in place.",
      "Carl Duronslet recalled spending three days trapped in an overpass in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina. Still, he said, he decided to stay put as Hurricane Ida approached his home in New Iberia, La.",
      "\u201cI have survived storms for 51 years,\u201d Mr. Duronslet said. \u201cI\u2019ll survive this one, too.\u201d",
      "The storm intensified quickly in large part because the water in the Gulf of Mexico is very warm, and warmer water provides more energy to storms. The Gulf is normally warm in late summer, but research over the past decade suggests that climate change also plays a role in the increased frequency of rapidly intensifying Atlantic hurricanes.",
      "Meteorologists said that the route taken by the storm, which had hovered in an area where the wind wasn\u2019t fast enough to carry the ocean\u2019s heat, created the conditions for a uniquely fast-worsening storm. \u201cIt would have been hard to concoct a path more favorable to this rapid strengthening than Ida\u2019s,\u201d said Robert Henson, an independent meteorologist and a journalist for Yale Climate Connections.",
      "Oceans are generally warming as a result of human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases, studies have shown, making the rapid intensification of hurricanes more frequent. In Hurricane Ida\u2019s case, it became a Category 4 hurricane only an hour after it first reached Category 3 status.",
      "The impact of this hurricane underscored the persistent peril facing coastal communities as a changing climate helps intensify the destructive force of the storms that have always been a seasonal part of life in the region.",
      "Louisiana was already struggling to claw its way back after a particularly active and destructive hurricane season in 2020. Governor Edwards has said that $3 billion in recovery needs remain unmet from last year.  ",
      "Hurricane Ida significantly disrupted the energy infrastructure along the coast, forcing oil and gas companies to shut down over 90 percent of production in the Gulf of Mexico. Workers were evacuated from offshore platforms. The Colonial Pipeline, which delivers transportation fuel from Texas to New York, said on Sunday that it had temporarily shut down some of its network.",
      "In New Orleans, the force of the winds ripped boats from their moorings along the coast and on the Mississippi River.",
      "\u201cA ferry broke loose on the river,\u201d Kelli Chandler, the regional director of the Southwest Louisiana Flood Protection Authority East, said after an emergency call came in on Sunday afternoon. Her staff called the U.S. Coast Guard and checked river cameras to see where the ferry was. They located it downriver from New Orleans, near Jackson Barracks.",
      "Though there was no traffic on the Mississippi River, unmoored vessels during a storm can ram into levees, causing damage. As soon as the winds fall below hurricane levels, a tug will be dispatched to bring the ferry back to safety. But for the moment on Sunday, it floated free.",
      "As night fell, many in New Orleans lit their homes with candles or flashlights.",
      "Samantha Egana was amazed that she still had power at her house in the Gentilly neighborhood of New Orleans hours after the storm had arrived. \u201cNobody else has lights,\u201d Ms. Egana, 56, said. \u201cMy daughter Uptown, no lights. My other daughter in the East, no lights.\u201d",
      "In 2005, Ms. Egana walked in water up to her chest to hail boats to come to her house to save her children and her grandchildren, including her grandson Moses, who was only 3 months old at the time.",
      "\u201cThis is not Katrina,\u201d she said as she looked outside her window. She deemed the rain and wind bearable, adding that the water was \u201csteady pouring down but it\u2019s not building up.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to pass,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d",

    "title": "Trail in Decades-Old Florida Killings Leads to Brazilian Man",
    "content": [
      "A man who died in a plane crash in Paraguay in 2005 was responsible for the deaths of three women whose killings in South Florida remained unsolved for two decades, the authorities said Tuesday, citing advances in crime-scene technology and years of detective work across two continents.",
      "The murders started in June 2000, when the body of Kimberly Dietz-Livesey, 35, was found in a suitcase on a roadside in Cooper City, Fla., southwest of Fort Lauderdale, the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office and the Miami Police Department said.",
      "Several weeks later, the body of Sia Demas, 21, was found in a duffel bag near Dania Beach, also in Broward County. A year later, the body of Jessica Good, 24, was spotted floating in Biscayne Bay, in Miami.",
      "Ms. Dietz-Livesey and Ms. Demas had been beaten to death. Ms. Good had been stabbed. All three had struggled with substance abuse and had turned to prostitution, detectives said.",
      "After interviewing Ms. Good\u2019s boyfriend, the authorities said, they quickly identified a suspect in her death: Roberto Wagner Fernandes, a Brazilian citizen living in Miami who immediately fled to Brazil after the killing.",
      "Mr. Fernandes\u2019s abrupt departure for Brazil presented detectives with a series of bureaucratic challenges, said Detective Zachary Scott of the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office. But he said that \u201cas the years have gone by,\u201d the Brazilian government \u201chas been nothing but helpful in this investigation, partially because Mr. Fernandes\u2019s name has come up in several investigations in Brazil as well.\u201d",
      "A break in the case came in 2011, when investigators matched DNA collected during the investigation of Ms. Good\u2019s murder with the DNA profile of the suspect in the Broward murders, the Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a statement. Investigators said they also learned that Mr. Fernandes\u2019s fingerprints were taken in 1996, when he was charged in Brazil with murdering his wife. He was acquitted in that case on a self-defense claim, investigators said, but the Brazilian authorities turned over a set of his fingerprints from the 1996 investigation that matched those found at the Florida crime scenes.",
      "Detectives flew to Brazil to take DNA evidence from Mr. Fernandes, only to learn that he had died in a plane crash on the way to Paraguay from Brazil in 2005.",
      "Investigators were wary. Detective Scott said at a news conference on Tuesday that \u201cthere were a lot of circumstantial things that were discovered in Brazil\u201d that led the authorities there \u201cto believe that he may have faked his own death.\u201d",
      "Moreover, Mr. Fernandes \u201chad amassed a certain amount of enemies\u201d in Brazil, Detective Scott said. His deceased wife\u2019s family \u201capparently harbored some ill feelings toward him,\u201d Detective Scott said, \u201cand it was believed that they had paid others to try to kill him,\u201d prompting him to flee the country.",
      "So detectives continued their investigation, working with the Justice Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Brazilian National Police.",
      "A Brazilian judge was recently persuaded to order the exhumation of Mr. Fernandes\u2019s body, investigators said, and his grave was opened in October. Mr. Fernandes\u2019s remains were found, and his DNA profile was consistent with the suspect profile created from the Florida murders, investigators said.",
      "Based on Mr. Fernandes\u2019s pattern of violent behavior, the authorities said in their statement, \u201cpart of this tragic story may sadly still be unwritten.\u201d It is possible, they said, that he was responsible for other killings in the United States. Anyone with information is urged to contact Broward Crime Stoppers at 954-493-8477 or to submit a tip at browardcrimestoppers.org.",
      "The Broward County sheriff, Gregory Tony, said that detectives \u2014 some retired, some now deceased \u2014 never stopped trying to solve the murders so the families of the victims would know what had happened to their loved ones.",
      "\u201cThese types of atrocities, as you can imagine, devastate the community and devastates the families because they have no closure,\u201d Sheriff Tony said.",
      "He added, \u201cJustice never expires.\u201d",
      "The fact that Mr. Fernandes was never brought to justice for his crimes still troubles investigators.",
      "\u201cI wish we were up here showing you his mug shot,\u201d Detective Scott said at the news conference. \u201cUnfortunately we were deprived of that pleasure. Knowing his last minutes on Earth were probably filled with terror makes me feel a little better.\u201d"

    "title": "What We Know About Climate Change and Hurricanes",
    "content": [
      "Hurricane Ida intensified overnight, becoming a Category 4 storm over the course of just a few hours. The rapid increase in strength raises questions about how much climate change is affecting hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean. While researchers can\u2019t say for sure whether human-caused climate change will mean longer or more active hurricane seasons in the future, there is broad agreement on one thing: Global warming is changing storms.",
      "Scientists say that unusually warm Atlantic surface temperatures have helped to increase storm activity. \u201cIt\u2019s very likely that human-caused climate change contributed to that anomalously warm ocean,\u201d said James P. Kossin, a climate scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \u201cClimate change is making it more likely for hurricanes to behave in certain ways.\u201d",
      "Here are some of those ways.",
      "There\u2019s a solid scientific consensus that hurricanes are becoming more powerful.",
      "Hurricanes are complex, but one of the key factors that determines how strong a given storm ultimately becomes is ocean surface temperature, because warmer water provides more of the energy that fuels storms.",
      "\u201cPotential intensity is going up,\u201d said Kerry Emanuel, a professor of atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cWe predicted it would go up 30 years ago, and the observations show it going up.\u201d",
      "Stronger winds mean downed power lines, damaged roofs and, when paired with rising sea levels, worse coastal flooding.",
      "\u201cEven if storms themselves weren\u2019t changing, the storm surge is riding on an elevated sea level,\u201d Dr. Emanuel said. He used New York City as an example, where sea levels have risen about a foot in the past century. \u201cIf Sandy\u2019s storm surge had occurred in 1912 rather than 2012,\u201d he said, \u201cit probably wouldn\u2019t have flooded Lower Manhattan.\u201d",
      "Warming also increases the amount of water vapor that the atmosphere can hold. In fact, every degree Celsius of warming allows the air to hold about 7 percent more water.",
      "That means we can expect future storms to unleash higher amounts of rainfall.",
      "Researchers do not yet know why storms are moving more slowly, but they are. Some say a slowdown in global atmospheric circulation, or global winds, could be partly to blame.",
      "In a 2018 paper, Dr. Kossin found that hurricanes over the United States had slowed 17 percent since 1947. Combined with the increase in rain rates, storms are causing a 25 percent increase in local rainfall in the United States, he said.",
      "Slower, wetter storms also worsen flooding. Dr. Kossin likened the problem to walking around your back yard while using a hose to spray water on the ground. If you walk fast, the water won\u2019t have a chance to start pooling. But if you walk slowly, he said, \u201cyou\u2019ll get a lot of rain below you.\u201d",
      "Because warmer water helps fuel hurricanes, climate change is enlarging the zone where hurricanes can form.",
      "There\u2019s a \u201cmigration of tropical cyclones out of the tropics and toward subtropics and middle latitudes,\u201d Dr. Kossin said. That could mean more storms making landfall in higher latitudes, like in the United States or Japan.",
      "As the climate warms, researchers also say they expect storms to intensify more rapidly. Researchers are still unsure why it\u2019s happening, but the trend appears to be clear.",
      "In a 2017 paper based on climate and hurricane models, Dr. Emanuel found that storms that intensify rapidly \u2014 the ones that increase their wind speed by 70 miles per hour or more in the 24 hours before landfall \u2014 were rare in the period from 1976 through 2005. On average, he estimated, their likelihood in those years was equal to about once per century.",
      "By the end of the 21st century, he found, those storms might form once every five or 10 years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a forecaster\u2019s nightmare,\u201d Dr. Emanuel said. If a tropical storm or Category 1 hurricane develops into a Category 4 hurricane overnight, he said, \u201cthere\u2019s no time to evacuate people.\u201d"

      "Nora was expected to move \u201cvery near\u201d the western coast of Mexico, but it could dissipate if it turns inland \u201cwithin the next day or so,\u201d the center said. The storm was expected to weaken as it churned along the coast.",
      "Though Nora was downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm, the storm still unleashed cascading floods and mudslides and prompted several water rescues, according to the Mexican authorities. The authorities warned people living in mountainous regions that they should be prepared to evacuate if necessary.",
      "Images emerged on social media showing homes collapsing and rescuers helping a man to safety as a deluge of muddy water threatened to sweep them away. One video showed a flood destroying a restaurant.",
      "Along Mexico\u2019s West Coast, up to 12 inches of rain were forecast in some areas, bringing life-threatening flash floods and mudslides, the center said.",
      "The Hurricane Center on Sunday afternoon issued a tropical storm warning for most of Sinaloa State and a tropical storm watch for the southern portion of Mexico\u2019s Baja California peninsula.",
      "As the storm approached Baja California, including the resort city of Cabo San Lucas, life-threatening surf and rip current conditions were expected, the center said.",
      "After the eye of the storm leaves Mexico, forecasters said, Nora is expected to bring rain and flash floods to parts of the southwestern United States and the central Rocky Mountains.",
      "Tropical Storm Nora devastated parts of Mexico the same weekend Hurricane Ida made landfall in Louisiana, battering the state with life-threatening winds and floods in what could be the most devastating hurricane to strike Louisiana since Hurricane Katrina in 2005.",
      "It has been a dizzying few weeks for meteorologists, who monitored three named storms that formed in quick succession in the Atlantic, bringing flooding and damaging winds to different parts of the United States and the Caribbean.",
      "Tropical Storm Fred made landfall on Aug. 16 in the Florida Panhandle. As Fred moved across the Southeast, it brought heavy rains and touched off several tornadoes. At least five people were killed after flash floods wiped out homes in western North Carolina in the wake of the storm.",
      "Grace formed in the eastern Caribbean on Aug. 14, the same day a 7.2-magnitude earthquake rocked Haiti\u2019s western peninsula. The storm quickly moved west as the country struggled to free people trapped in rubble, bringing at least 10 inches of rain. Grace then made another landfall on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, bringing more heavy rain, power failures and hundreds of evacuations. A third landfall, on the eastern coast of Mexico\u2019s mainland, left at least eight people dead.",
      "And Henri formed on Aug. 16 as a tropical storm off the East Coast of the United States. It strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane but was downgraded before making landfall in Rhode Island. It thrashed the Northeast with fierce winds and torrential rain, knocking out power to more than 140,000 households from New Jersey to Maine.",
      "The links between hurricanes and climate change are becoming more apparent. A warming planet can expect to see stronger hurricanes over time and a higher incidence of the most powerful storms \u2014 though the overall number of storms could drop because factors like stronger wind shear could keep weaker storms from forming."

      "This article is part of Overlooked, a series of obituaries about remarkable people whose deaths, beginning in 1851, went unreported in The Times.",
      "Randy Snow was 16 when the accident happened.",
      "It was July 1975, and he was toiling away at his summer job on a farm in Paris, Texas, when a 1,000-pound bale of hay that he was loading onto a tractor fell from its prongs, crushing him in the tractor\u2019s steering compartment. The impact severed his spine, and despite months of rehab, he would never walk again.",
      "But it did not stop him from becoming a world champion athlete. He became the first Paralympian in history to win medals in three different sports \u2014 track, basketball and, most notably, tennis.",
      "By the time he retired from competitive wheelchair sports in 2000, Snow had won 10 U.S. Open tennis singles titles and six in doubles play. In the 1990-91 season alone, he won 68 consecutive matches and 15 straight tournaments, becoming the first International Tennis Federation Wheelchair World Champion. He earned gold medals in singles and doubles at the 1992 Paralympics in Barcelona, and in 2004 he became the first Paralympic athlete inducted into the Olympic Hall of Fame.",
      "In 2012, he was inducted posthumously into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, R.I. He had died of a heart attack on Nov. 19, 2009, in El Salvador, where he had been giving a tennis clinic. He was 50.",
      "Snow became a leader in developing wheelchair tennis, which had only a handful of tournaments when he began playing. It is now played in more than 100 countries and at all four major championships \u2014 Wimbledon and the Australian, French and U.S. Opens.",
      "\u201cDreams make everyday life tolerable,\u201d Snow, who became an author and motivational speaker, wrote in an essay in 2000. \u201cWithout dreams, life would be mediocre. Initially my spinal cord injury dashed any hope of achieving those dreams. But sometimes re-dreaming is necessary. As I reflect on the 25 years after that hot July day, I now know that my childhood dreams were realized. Not only did I win the U.S. Open, I won it 10 times. I just happened to win it in a wheelchair.\u201d",
      "Thomas Randall Snow was born on May 24, 1959, in Austin, Texas, the oldest of four children of Alison Lee McElhone, a kindergarten teacher, and Thomas Snow, a real estate attorney who had played baseball at the University of Texas. The family later moved to Terrell, east of Dallas.",
      "Randy was an ardent athlete, excelling in football, baseball, basketball and tennis. Though his parents divorced when he was 12, they lived less than a mile apart and each built a backyard tennis court to encourage family participation in the sport.",
      "\u201cIt seemed like he always had a ball in his hand,\u201d his father said in a phone interview. \u201cStudies were not his thing. He was most interested in sports.\u201d",
      "Randy was on the football team at Terrell High School when he suffered the spinal injury. After spending months in a Dallas hospital and then at a rehabilitation facility in Denver, he was on his way home when he asked his family if he could stop by the school, where a pep rally for his former team was taking place. As the students and staff members rose in ovation, Snow spun his wheelchair and bellowed, \u201cI\u2019m baaaack!\u201d The crowd roared its approval.",
      "\u201cThat was Randy,\u201d his sister Jenny Sperry said in a phone interview. \u201cI\u2019m still here, I\u2019m still showy, and I still have my spunk.\u201d",
      "After graduating from high school in 1977, Snow enrolled at the University of Texas, Austin, where he helped start a wheelchair basketball team. He also began a lifelong addiction to drugs and alcohol, a battle that would take him in and out of rehab for the next 25 years, his father said.",
      "Struggling academically at Austin, Snow transferred to UT-Arlington and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in business there in 1986. He later received a master\u2019s degree in psychology from the University of Phoenix.",
      "In the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, Snow won a silver medal during an exhibition wheelchair race that looped four times around the track of the Los Angeles Coliseum before a crowd of about 60,000.",
      "His father said, \u201cI was screaming, \u2018Hurry up!\u2019 even though I knew he couldn\u2019t hear me.\u201d",
      "Snow was in last place, he said, \u201cbut then, when Randy was passing everyone on the final lap \u2014 just like it was a horse race \u2014 the crowd went crazy.\u201d",
      "Snow began playing wheelchair tennis around 1980 after attending a clinic led by Brad Parks, a co-founder of the National Foundation of Wheelchair Tennis and a former world champion in the sport. The two became fierce rivals on the court.",
      "\u201cHe once told me that he put my picture on his bathroom wall because he wanted to beat me so badly,\u201d Parks said of Snow by phone. \u201cThat\u2019s how competitive he was.\u201d",
      "They later became partners and secured the gold medal in doubles at the 1992 Paralympics in Barcelona.",
      "Snow also competed for the United States in the men\u2019s World Team Cup from 1986 to 1995, helping the team win seven championship titles while traveling all over the world in a high performance, lightweight Quickie wheelchair that he had designed with his business partner, the wheelchair athlete Marilyn Hamilton.",
      "In 1996, Hamilton arranged for him to receive the Olympic torch from President Bill Clinton in Washington to start the relay to the opening ceremony of the Atlanta Paralympics.",
      "As an author Snow wrote \u201cWheelchair Tennis: Myth to Reality\u201d with Dr. Bal Moore, a college coach and close friend and a mentor for 12 years. Published in 1994, it is widely regarded as the gold standard for teaching the sport of wheelchair tennis. Snow also wrote \u201cPushing Forward: A Memoir of Motivation\u201d (2001) and \u201cToo Far From Home\u201d (2006), whose cover describes it as \u201cA Book About Change, Teamwork, and Being Safe.\u201d",
      "Moore met with Snow regularly for 6 a.m. \u201cvisits\u201d \u2014 practice sessions in which Snow developed an effective topspin backhand, a harder serve and more potent volleying, most of which his opponents had not yet mastered.",
      "\u201cRandy was really strong, and he had this big-barreled chest which he used to house the heart of a lion,\u201d said David Kiley, a friend and frequent opponent.",
      "In his later years Snow taught beginners at camps he ran worldwide, imploring them, Parks said, to cheer, \u201cWheelchair tennis: I love it, I love it, I love it!\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never known anyone who could captivate like Randy,\u201d Paul Walker, a professional wheelchair tennis player, wrote in an email. \u201cHe was a magician with people young and old.\u201d",
      "Three months after his death in El Salvador, his friend and fellow tennis player Bill Hammett returned there to spread some of Snow\u2019s ashes in the Pacific Ocean, not far from a public court that was renamed in Snow\u2019s honor. Hammett dipped his toes in the chilly water, then slipped on a stone under the surface. As he fell, he held a fruit jar that contained Snow\u2019s ashes high above his head to protect them.",
      "\u201cEveryone who was watching from the beach thought I was crying,\u201d Hammett said by phone. \u201cBut I was just laying there laughing. I couldn\u2019t help thinking, \u2018Randy, I know you\u2019re laughing your ass off right now.\u2019\u201d"

    "title": "Ida Strengthened Quickly Into a Monster. Here\u2019s How.",
    "content": [
      "Hurricane Ida, which struck the Louisiana coast on Sunday with winds of 150 miles an hour, gained power faster more than most storms. Because of climate change, such rapid strengthening is happening more often as hurricanes pick up more energy from ocean water that is warmer than before.",
      "But in a summer of extreme weather, Ida\u2019s intensification was extreme.",
      "According to the National Hurricane Center\u2019s forecast bulletins, the storm\u2019s maximum sustained winds as of Saturday morning were about 85 m.p.h., making it a Category 1 hurricane. Less than 24 hours later they were 65 m.p.h. stronger, bringing Ida close to a Category 5.",
      "The storm intensified more than the hurricane center\u2019s forecast, which had called for maximum winds reaching 140 m.p.h. The hurricane center\u2019s definition of rapid intensification is at least a 35 m.p.h. increase in wind speed in 24 hours. Ida strengthened that much in just six hours overnight.",
      "Climate change is part of the reason. Researchers have found that the frequency of rapidly intensifying Atlantic hurricanes has increased over the past four decades as ocean temperatures have risen, in large part because warmer water provides more of the energy that fuels these storms. In the 1980s, there was about a 1 percent chance that a hurricane would undergo rapid intensification. Now, there\u2019s a 5 percent chance.",
      "But experts who study the behavior of hurricanes said other factors played a role with Ida, including seasonal warming of the Gulf of Mexico, the amount of moisture in the atmosphere and the presence or absence of winds that can affect the structure of a storm.",
      "Right now the Gulf is extremely warm because it accumulated heat throughout the summer. It\u2019s this seasonal warming, which happens in the Atlantic Ocean as well, that makes mid-August through October the most active part of the hurricane season every year.",
      "But it\u2019s not just the surface temperature of the Gulf that\u2019s important, said Joshua Wadler, a researcher with the University of Miami and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Hurricanes actually cool the ocean as they travel across it, because they stir up the water down to about 150 feet, mixing in colder water from below.",
      "In this case, Ida traveled across water that was much warmer down to that depth. Probes sent into the water by hurricane hunter aircraft on Saturday revealed that the temperature, after it had been mixed by Ida, was about 30 degrees Celsius, or 86 degrees Fahrenheit, Dr. Wadler said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s on the very high end of sea surface temperatures that hurricanes ever experience,\u201d he said.",
      "The storm\u2019s path happened to track over this warm water, what scientists call an eddy, said Chris Slocum, a NOAA researcher.",
      "\u201cIda found the perfect path across the gulf, where the warmest water is,\u201d he said, and that provided plenty of energy for the storm to extract. \u201cYou could say it\u2019s a worst-case scenario.\u201d",
      "Dr. Slocum compared the situation to that of Katrina, in 2005, which crossed a cooler water column as it neared Louisiana, weakening from a Category 5 to a Category 3. Ida did not encounter any cooler water.",
      "\u201cThis one is continuing the upward trend,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s going to stop the intensification process is landfall,\u201d he said.",
      "Eddies occur in the Gulf every year, formed when part of a looping current breaks off, Dr. Wadler said. And while it\u2019s extremely difficult to link a specific one to climate change, this one \u201cis as deep as we\u2019ve seen in a very long time,\u201d he said.",
      "While ocean temperatures are most important, two other factors affect how much and how quickly a storm strengthens, Dr. Slocum said.",
      "Atmospheric moisture affects the thunderstorms that make up a tropical cyclone. The more humid the air, the more these storms will survive and persist. And the way these thunderstorms interact with each other, particularly at the eye of the storm, can affect whether it strengthens or weakens.",
      "Wind shear \u2014 changes in wind speed and direction with height in the atmosphere \u2014 can also affect the structure of a hurricane. If the wind shear is too strong, \u201cyou can tear a storm apart,\u201d Dr. Slocum said.",
      "The hurricane center\u2019s forecasters had been watching wind shear closely. It had been a factor as the storm entered the Gulf on Friday, giving Ida an asymmetric structure. But the shear dissipated on Saturday, allowing the storm to assume a more regular spiral shape.",
      "The effect on wind speed can be likened to what happens with figure skaters during a spin. Skaters who keep their arms in a tight, precise position will rotate faster. But if one of their arms is extended, they\u2019ll rotate much more slowly.",
      "Forecasting whether a hurricane will intensify rapidly can be difficult, Dr. Slocum said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a Goldilocks problem,\u201d he said. \u201cIf one of these ingredients is a little bit off, we\u2019re not going to see it.\u201d"

      "MOSCOW \u2014 In August 1991, Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, returned to Moscow with his family from house arrest in Crimea after a K.G.B.-managed anti-democracy coup had failed to depose him.",
      "Instead of joining hundreds of thousands of ecstatic Muscovites, who had gathered on the city\u2019s squares to celebrate his victory and theirs, Gorbachev went to a hospital with his wife, Raisa, who had suffered a stroke.",
      "This scene was pivotal for Russia\u2019s recent history, and it is also central to \u201cGorbachev,\u201d the latest hit production from the state Theater of Nations in Moscow, where despite the pandemic shows continued to be performed live, though at limited capacity.",
      "\u201cI was not married to the country \u2014 Russia or the Soviet Union,\u201d Gorbachev, who is now 90 and still lives in Moscow, wrote in his memoirs.",
      "\u201cI was married to my wife, and that night I went with her to hospital,\u201d his character, masterly played by Yevgeny Mironov, said from the stage. \u201cPerhaps it was the most crucial decision of my political life.\u201d",
      "\u201cGorbachev,\u201d which premiered last October, is an ode to the love story of the Gorbachevs. By putting their relationship at its center, the play does something extraordinary for the Russian performing arts culture. It portrays the country\u2019s leader as a human being instead of a grand demiurge, responsible for its future. It shows Gorbachev as someone for whom sentiments and moral obligations, to his wife, friends and citizens, reigned supreme over political expediency.",
      "In a country where autocrats, including the current one, carefully protect their image and personal life, \u201cGorbachev\u201d is a breath of fresh air. It celebrates the humanity of a person who is almost universally celebrated as a liberator and equally despised by many in Russia as the butcher of the country\u2019s superpower status.",
      "Alvis Hermanis, the acclaimed Latvian director who wrote and staged the play, tried to show how political matters appear secondary in the presence of true love. In the tradition of Russian classics, Hermanis makes the theme of love primary to historical events, which serve only as background. He makes the story universal, applicable not only to the leader of a vast nation but also to all of us.",
      "To achieve this result, Hermanis uses the tools of Russia\u2019s psychological realism tradition. The only two actors onstage, Chulpan Khamatova as Raisa Gorbacheva and Mironov as the last Soviet president, play impeccably with eerie precision, creating an atmosphere of timelessness, and melancholia. Under Hermanis\u2019s direction, the play\u2019s pacing gives the viewer enough space to reflect on the characters.",
      "The whole production takes place in a dressing room with two makeup stations and two mirrors. There is a rack of dresses, and wigs are scattered around the space. This is a work in progress. A large sign on the entrance door reads: \u201cSilence! Performance is ongoing.\u201d",
      "Khamatova and Mironov enter in what could easily be their usual street clothes: a hoodie, jeans, an unpretentious black shirt. Over the course of the performance, they will transform onstage, change their attire and looks as they age.",
      "The two actors start by reading their lines out loud, discussing how to impersonate their characters. Slowly, through discussion, they adopt their roles, most visibly by imitating accents: Mikhail\u2019s southern Cossack-derived pronunciation with elongated vowels and Raisa\u2019s highly pitched chirping of an enthusiastic philosophy major in a country where the only accepted philosophical school was Marxism.",
      "Khamatova and Mironov, who are among the finest drama theater actors of their generation, leave the stage only once, for the intermission in this three-hour performance. Slowly and seamlessly, they read out and play out their lives: The story of Stalin\u2019s purges is followed by the gruesome war with Germany. Then their lives get consumed  by their university love affair and, finally, by Gorbachev\u2019s rise to the top through the ranks of party nomenklatura.",
      "The story of Gorbachev at the helm of one of the world\u2019s two superpowers is treated as background noise: \u201cIt was just one, six-year-long working day,\u201d Raisa says from the stage. In the end, by the time the actors are already fully immersed in their characters, we only see a 90-year-old Mikhail. (At this point, Mironov is wearing a mask that covers his entire head, with Gorbachev\u2019s port-wine birthmark on full display.) For the last few minutes, Mikhail is by himself, mourning his wife\u2019s death in 1999 from leukemia, remembering her last words: \u201cDo you remember if we returned the white shoes that we borrowed from Nina for our wedding?\u201d",
      "The play\u2019s success, and the insatiable demand for tickets that sell out in a half-hour and cost up to $250, can be attributed to the fact that its creators had something personal at stake.",
      "For Hermanis, Gorbachev, who liberated his native Latvia from the Soviet yoke, was the third person \u201cwho changed his life the most after his father and mother,\u201d he said in an interview with a Russian state-run broadcaster.",
      "For Khamatova, Gorbachev gave hope for \u201ca different life with the freedom of speech and sexual orientation,\u201d she said in an interview with the Russian GQ.",
      "For Mironov, who, as manager of the Theater of Nations, turned it into Moscow\u2019s premier cultural institution over the past decade, Gorbachev provided artistic freedom at the time when he was just starting his career in the late 1980s.",
      "\u201cAfter getting into Gorbachev\u2019s skin, I realized that he wasn\u2019t a politician,\u201d Mironov said in an interview recorded during rehearsals last year.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why he did what he did \u2014 that\u2019s why he is so interesting and valuable to me as a person,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause he behaved like a human being.\u201d",
      "The sense of care oozes through every pore of the acting and directing. That wouldn\u2019t be enough, however, without the mastery that is also on full display here, which only testifies to the fact that it is time for Russian theater to cultivate more new territories, including the country\u2019s most recent history.",
      "In that vein, the authors could have gone farther along their path. For instance, the production could have put more emphasis on the role of Raisa. The production could have been called Raisa, after all. With her independence and carefully crafted looks, she was among the most hated figures in late Soviet times. (My grandfather called her nothing but \u201crat\u201d because her name rhymes with the word for rat in Russian.)",
      "It is time to do her justice.",
      "In the end, Gorbachev, who attended one of the final rehearsals, and stood up to a standing ovation from a box, did not ask for a single change.",
      "\u201cThis is freedom,\u201d he said, according to Mironov. \u201cGet used to it.\u201d"

    "content": [
      "Two days after Hurricane Ida arrived in Southern Louisiana, hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses remained without power and many could stay that way for weeks as crews work to restore downed power lines belonging to Entergy, the largest utility in the state.",
      "It was the second year in a row that the company\u2019s lines suffered extensive damage from hurricanes and storms, which scientists believe are becoming more intense and damaging because of climate change. As anger and frustration build in New Orleans and southern Louisiana, where the heat and humidity made it feel like more than 100 degrees on Tuesday, some energy experts questioned whether Entergy did enough to protect its lines and equipment from extreme weather.",
      "In August 2020, Hurricane Laura, which like Ida was a Category 4 storm, cut a destructive path across Louisiana, toppling many of Entergy\u2019s lines and equipment.",
      "\u201cTheir vintage equipment didn\u2019t stand up to Laura, and I suspect the same report for Ida,\u201d said Robert McCullough, an energy consultant who runs McCullough Research in Portland, Ore.",
      "The company\u2019s power plants have the ability to generate electricity but Entergy can\u2019t move that energy to homes and businesses because the storm has brought down or damaged much of its network of towers, poles and wires.",
      "Entergy said it had shut down a natural gas plant in New Orleans that began operation last year, pointing to damage to power lines, including those that carry electricity to homes and businesses. That plant, which was meant to provide electricity to the city during periods of high demand and in emergencies, was not heavily damaged in the storm, the company said.",
      "Several other plants near the city also are ready to produce electricity when workers complete enough repairs to power lines. They include Ninemile 6 in Westwego, La., and the J. Wayne Leonard Power Station in Montz, La.",
      "\u201cTeams are assessing the transmission system and working to develop a plan for restoration of power,\u201d Jerry Nappi, a spokesman for Entergy, said in an email on Tuesday. \u201cThey expect to have first light within the city by end of day Wednesday.\u201d",
      "The company said on Monday that Hurricane Ida had put 216 substations and more than 2,000 miles of transmission lines out of service. A conductor on one transmission line fell from an Entergy tower into the Mississippi River near Avondale, La. The utility and others have posted numerous pictures online of transmission and distribution towers lying on the ground.",
      "The storm also damaged some of the utility\u2019s plants in the New Orleans area, Entergy said on Tuesday. As the storm\u2019s winds increased, Entergy said, it disconnected the Waterford 3 Nuclear Generating Station in St. Charles Parish from the grid, noting that the facility remained in a safe and stable condition. The plant was listed on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission site as not producing power.",
      "Gov. John Bel Edwards, who has praised Entergy for building the J. Wayne Leonard plant, expressed some frustration on Tuesday with the pace at which the company was restoring power.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not satisfied with 30 days, the Entergy people aren\u2019t satisfied with 30 days, nobody who\u2019s out there needing power is satisfied with that,\u201d Mr. Edwards, a Democrat, said. \u201cBut I am mindful that we just had the strongest hurricane \u2014 at least tied for the strongest \u2014 that the state has ever experienced.\u201d",
      "Entergy provides power to three million customers in Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi and Texas. It also operates several nuclear power plants, most of them in the South.",
      "The financial costs of storms are piling up for Entergy. In addition to the repairs it is making because of Ida, the company\u2019s equipment was damaged in three hurricanes in 2020 and a winter storm this year. Entergy told Louisiana regulators that restoration costs in the state relating to the earlier storms would total $2.1 billion.",
      "Storms appear to be taking a bigger toll. Regulators let Entergy entities recover $732 million for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which hit in 2005, according to materials that Phillip May, chief executive of Entergy Louisiana, submitted to the Louisiana Public Service Commission in April. After adjusting for inflation, the two 2005 hurricanes cost the company $1 billion in 2021 dollars.",
      "The company is seeking permission to charge customers higher electricity rates to cover repair costs. Regulators typically end up approving such requests, but ratepayers may object to frequent rate increases.",
      "In its request to raise rates, Entergy detailed the scale of the wreckage of the most damaging of last year\u2019s storms \u2014 Hurricane Laura. The company said 1,822 transmission structures, 12,453 distribution poles and roughly 770 miles of distribution wires were destroyed or damaged.",
      "The total bill for the 2020 hurricanes may be even higher than the company has estimated so far. In February, Entergy said in a securities filing that hurricanes last year damaged several transmission lines, including an unspecified one in southeastern Louisiana. The company said that the line had not been repaired because it could cost a lot to do so. \u201cThe restoration plan for this transmission line and the related cost estimate is still being evaluated,\u201d Entergy said in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Entergy did not immediately respond to questions about that transmission line and whether it had been repaired or removed.",
      "The company, which employs more than 13,000 people, brought in $10.1 billion in revenue in 2020 and its profits climbed 12 percent, to $1.4 billion. Though Entergy will most likely be able to pass on storm costs to customers, the company has struggled to win over investors. Over the past two years, its stock is down about 2 percent, compared with a 10 percent increase for utility stocks in the S&P 500 and 55 percent for the S&P 500 as a whole."

      "\u201cIt\u2019s Never Too Late\u201d is a new series that tells the stories of people who decide to pursue their dreams on their own terms.",
      "Hear the one about the opera singer-turned farmer?",
      "There isn\u2019t a punchline. There\u2019s just the pre-dawn wake-up, and the baling, and the 150 heifers, and one with pink eye and the thousand other realities of Martha Prewitt\u2019s new existence.",
      "This wasn\u2019t the plan. Growing up on the family farm in Versailles, Ky., two centuries of Prewitt corn and hay and cattle bearing down, the plan was: leave.",
      "She did, following a passion for performance into 15 years of classical singing and opera, performing with the Knoxville Opera, Capitol Opera Richmond in Virginia and Charlottesville Opera in Virginia, and earning a Master\u2019s degree in vocal performance along the way. But sometimes passions curdle, and sometimes barn doors blow back open.",
      "At 33, following the sudden death of her father last year, Ms. Prewitt came home again. It never seemed possible, doing what he\u2019d done all those years. But there, under the wide Kentucky sky, she discovered that something had shifted. (The following interview has been edited and condensed.)",
      "Tell me about the opera life you\u2019d been leading before this change?",
      "I got into opera through choir, in high school. The thrill of singing with an orchestra, the vibration in your bones, being totally in character and completely outside of yourself. There\u2019s nothing else like it.",
      "But there are things about the industry that didn\u2019t gel with me, politically and culturally. With a few exceptions, I thought the opera world was operating under an outdated, elitist business model. A few years ago I started to fall out of love.",
      "Had you ever considered farming?",
      "The farm\u2019s been in the family since 1780 or so. My dad was a farmer from when he could walk. He could do anything: build a house, fix machines, tend to the soil\u2019s pH level, plumbing and electrical work. Farming never seemed right for me, partly because I just didn\u2019t think I could do it. I\u2019m a woman, I\u2019m 5\u20196\u201d \u2014 that was a lot of it.",
      "After he passed away in June 2020, I was living at home again to be with my mom, and this little worm started to work its way through my brain: \u2018Women can be farmers, too. Maybe you\u2019re not strong now, but maybe throwing hay bales around will make you strong.\u2019",
      "What was it that made you take that chance?",
      "I always knew I\u2019d eventually inherit the farm, and it means a lot to me that it stays a farm. Who knows what developer would buy it and turn it into some subdivision or shopping center?",
      "I started thinking, if it means that much to me, why not take it on? Why not me? Soon I was researching things like regenerative agriculture, or how much chemical to put in the spray mix.",
      "How did you get started?",
      "Those first few days, I began getting up early and going out with our farm manager, Sherman. At first we\u2019d just feed the cattle together, and then I started working full days with him.",
      "I began to love it. If there\u2019s any aspect of farming you don\u2019t like, it\u2019s not long before something different needs to get done. I got stronger. And I learned that I\u2019m pretty optimistic, which is good, because a farmer has to be.",
      "How did you find the courage to take on this huge project?",
      "My dad once told me, \u201cWhen things need to get done on a farm, you just have to get them done. There\u2019s no choice.\u201d It\u2019s true, and I\u2019ve learned that suits me. I\u2019m still pretty terrified, but I\u2019ve also started to think, maybe I can be good at this.",
      "How has this new life changed you?",
      "During lockdown, I didn\u2019t go outside for six weeks. I didn\u2019t even walk out to my car. Now I\u2019m outside every day, for most of the day. I\u2019ve hardly used my computer since moving back, and I don\u2019t watch much TV. I have a much deeper appreciation for nature and the environment \u2014 its beauty and also its power.",
      "Do you still sing?",
      "A lot of what I do these days is driving a tractor. It\u2019s great because I can sing as loud as I want. \u201cUn bel d\u00ec vedremo,\u201d from \u201cMadama Butterfly\u201d is one of my favorite arias, and I\u2019ll start singing it in the middle of a field, surrounded by trees and birds and dirt. I\u2019ve sung to cattle a few times. Sometimes bugs fly in my mouth.",
      "What would you tell other people who feel stuck and are looking to make a change?",
      "Everybody has a different path. In my case, just because all these other farmers have been doing it all their lives, it didn\u2019t make my ability to farm any less.",
      "If you\u2019re feeling stuck, being patient and not freaking out about it is so important. Everything you do gives you experience and skills and tools, wherever you go. I ended up finding something much more profound than I\u2019d ever expected. It\u2019s as if I\u2019m working in all times, past, present and future, in the midst of my ancestors who were here before and future generations who will come after me.",
      "Anything you wish you\u2019d done differently when you were younger?",
      "I wish I\u2019d done 4H.",
      "What can people learn from your experience?",
      "People always say, \u201cFollow your passion.\u201d Well, I tried that. I sang opera. It ended up not being how I want to spend my life.",
      "I took, I don\u2019t know how many, personality tests. Nothing ever said I should be a farmer, except this little nagging voice saying maybe I could.",
      "We\u2019re looking for people who decide that it\u2019s never too late to switch gears, change their life and pursue dreams. Should we talk to you or someone you know? Share your story here."

      "The fight over masks and vaccines is heating up \u2014  especially between President Biden and the governors who hope to defeat him in 2024. Many Republicans see the rules as a threat to their personal freedom that is more dangerous than the coronavirus itself.",
      "In Florida, Ron DeSantis has prevented local governments and school districts from requiring masks. In Texas, Greg Abbott renewed his ban on compulsory vaccines. And in South Dakota, Kristi Noem has made her blanket opposition to lockdowns and mandates a key selling point for her potential presidential bid.",
      "DeSantis has become a symbolic face of the battle. On Monday he made good on a threat to withhold funding from local school boards \u2014 Alachua County\u2019s and Broward County\u2019s \u2014 that made students wear masks.",
      "But school budgets may not be affected, because the Biden administration has offered to use federal stimulus funds to make up the difference. The Biden administration is also investigating five Republican-led states that won\u2019t let schools require masks to determine whether this violates federal protections for students with disabilities.",
      "The actions of Republican governors reflect how the views of the party\u2019s base have hardened when it comes to curbing Covid. Ever-rising death tolls are seen as less politically damaging than imposing coronavirus rules of almost any stripe.",
      "Sixty percent of Florida residents supported universal masking in schools in a recent poll. But 72 percent among Republicans opposed it. A plurality of Republicans in the state also opposed a mask requirement for health care workers.",
      "\u201cMany Republicans are out on an island by themselves,\u201d said Whit Ayres, a veteran G.O.P. pollster. \u201cIt may be a safe political place for some primary electorates at the moment. But ultimately you have to win a general election.\u201d",
      "Another Republican strategist privately lamented, only half-jokingly, that vaccine hesitancy could ultimately kill off part of the party\u2019s own base.",
      "The highly contagious Delta variant has shown itself to be highly effective at spreading in unprotected settings and populations.",
      "A detailed new study from the C.D.C. found that an unvaccinated elementary school teacher in Marin County, Calif., spread the coronavirus to half of her 24-student class in May and June when she lowered her mask to read aloud, in violation of the school\u2019s rules.",
      "Twelve of her students, who were masked but too young to be vaccinated, subsequently contracted the virus. The Delta variant outbreak subsequently spread to at least 26 people.",
      "\u201cI thought I respected its contagiousness,\u201d Dr. Lisa Santora, deputy health officer the Marin Health and Human Services and an author of the report, said of the Delta variant. But its efficiency in overtaking the classroom \u201csurprised and humbled\u201d her.",
      "Around 70 percent of adults in the European Union have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, which puts the bloc among the world\u2019s leaders in vaccinations despite a sluggish start.",
      "While the vaccination rate slowed this month, it has yet to reach a ceiling that some experts and officials feared would arrive over the summer. Taking children and teenagers into account, more than 55 percent of the overall E.U. population has been fully vaccinated, compared with 52 percent in the United States, 61 percent in Israel and 64 percent in Britain.",
      "But there are wide differences between member countries, because each runs its own vaccination campaign.",
      "While more than 80 percent of adults have been fully inoculated in Belgium, Denmark and Portugal, and more than 75 percent in Spain and the Netherlands, the figure falls to 45 percent in Latvia, 31 percent in Romania and 20 percent in Bulgaria.",
      "In Bulgaria, disinformation, poor trust in institutions and a lack of a communication strategy have plagued efforts, including among older people. Romania got off to a fast start in urban areas, Euronews reported, but it has struggled to vaccinate its rural population, of which it has the highest share in the European Union. Since its campaign slowed, Romania has sold and donated doses to avoid wasting them.",
      "I have to write/journal the things I want to tell my patients without expressing the frustration I feel when they refuse to get vaccinated: \u201cYou trust us giving you your chemotherapy and helping you manage the uncomfortable side effects. You trust us helping bring your new baby into this world. You trust us providing comfort to your loved ones when they are dying. You trust telling us when you are mistreated. Trust us when we say get vaccinated, it can save your life.\u201d \u2014 Dorene Boydston, NP, Idaho",

    "title": "Biden Faces a Tragedy He Pledged to Avoid",
    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 It was exactly what President Biden feared most.",
      "His decision to end America\u2019s longest war was driven, he had said repeatedly, by his determination not to sacrifice even one more member of the military on behalf of an effort he had long believed was no longer in the interests of the United States.",
      "But on Thursday morning, the withdrawal he set in motion claimed the lives of 13 U.S. troops, along with scores of Afghan civilians \u2014 the first American casualties in Afghanistan in 18 months and the deadliest day there for the U.S. military since 2011.",
      "In searing remarks from the East Room of the White House Thursday evening, Mr. Biden pledged to \u201chunt down\u201d the terrorists who claimed credit for the bombings at the Kabul airport but said the frantic, dangerous evacuation of U.S. citizens and allies from Afghanistan would continue for several more days.",
      "\u201cTo those who carried out this attack, as well as anyone who wishes America harm, know this: We will not forgive,\u201d Mr. Biden said, using language that had grim echoes of warnings President George W. Bush made after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. \u201cWe will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay.\u201d",
      "America\u2019s tumultuous exit from Afghanistan has dragged down Mr. Biden\u2019s approval ratings, and the bombings on Thursday surely will open him up to political criticism. But it was unclear what the damage would be to his presidency in the long term, as he exits a war that most Americans want out of as well.",
      "Before the attacks, the president\u2019s aides said privately that they did not believe there would be long-term political damage to Mr. Biden, especially as the military successfully evacuated more than 100,000 people in less than two weeks. But the deaths of American service members \u2014 and scores of Afghans \u2014 could scramble those calculations.",
      "The president\u2019s Republican critics seized on the bombings and vowed to hold him accountable for the consequences of his decision to withdraw troops from Afghanistan.",
      "\u201cIt was the direct result of horribly misguided decisions from President Biden. This demands painful accountability,\u201d said Representative John Katko of New York, the top Republican on the Homeland Security Committee. \u201cOur commander in chief has been missing in action and has failed to rise to this pivotal moment in our history.\u201d",
      "Few Democratic lawmakers jumped to defend Mr. Biden in the hours after the attacks. Instead, most expressed grief over the loss of life in Kabul.",
      "\u201cI am angered by the despicable terrorist attacks at Hamid Karzai Airport,\u201d said Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island. \u201cToday\u2019s loss of life is tragic.\u201d",
      "Mr. Biden delivered his remarks about the bombings hours after the Pentagon confirmed suicide bombers had inflicted the deadliest attack on U.S. forces in Afghanistan in a decade. He expressed \u201cheartache\u201d for what he described as \u201ca tough day,\u201d and said he had asked his commanders to target ISIS-K, the Afghan affiliate of the Islamic State, which claimed responsibility for the attacks.",
      "\u201cWe will respond with force and precision, at the place we choose and the moment of our choosing,\u201d he said.",
      "Mr. Biden hailed the sacrifice of the soldiers, 12 of whom were Marines, who lost their lives, and the 18 other American service members who were injured in the blasts, even as the military worked to carry out his decision to fully withdraw from Afghanistan.",
      "He pledged that the United States would uphold its \u201csacred obligation\u201d to the families of the fallen in Afghanistan, calling those who died in the attacks \u201cheroes who have been engaged in a dangerous, selfless mission to save the lives of others.\u201d",
      "Mr. Biden said that as president, he bore responsibility for \u201call that\u2019s happened,\u201d but he again denied that his decision to withdraw forces by the end of the summer led inevitably to the chaotic scenes of evacuation at the airport, or to the deaths at the hands of the terrorists.",
      "\u201cI had only one alternative: pour thousands of more troops back into Afghanistan,\u201d he said. \u201cI have never been of the view that we should be sacrificing American lives to try to establish a democratic government in Afghanistan.\u201d",
      "But that is unlikely to satisfy his critics, including some members of his own party, who disagreed with the way Mr. Biden brought an end to the war.",
      "On Thursday morning, as word of the attacks spread, Senator Bob Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey and the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, called the situation in Kabul \u201ca full-fledged humanitarian crisis.\u201d He said the Biden administration must complete the evacuation as planned.",
      "Acting against the advice of his generals and overruling some of his top foreign policy advisers, Mr. Biden announced in April his decision to withdraw the remaining 2,500 American troops from the country. The president has said that he did not want to call the parents of another Marine, soldier or airman killed in action in Afghanistan.",
      "But the rapid takeover of the country by the Taliban caught the administration off guard and set in motion a chaotic evacuation in which almost 6,000 American troops tried to secure the Kabul airport against the Taliban and terror groups. Earlier this week, Mr. Biden rejected calls from lawmakers, activists and other world leaders to extend the American presence at the airport past Aug. 31, citing the potential for terrorist attacks.",
      "Since Aug. 14, just before the Taliban seized control of Kabul, the administration says it has evacuated more than 100,000 people, ferrying them to safety. But administration officials concede that there are still more Americans and Afghan allies that want to leave the country.",
      "On Thursday, Mr. Biden said he still intended to meet his Aug. 31 deadline for a full withdrawal. But he also said he would not accelerate the departure because of the bombings. He said his top military officials had told him they had the resources to continue the evacuations even in the face of ongoing threats while also protecting the airport from what they expected would be more attacks in the days ahead.",
      "And he said continuing the evacuation would prove to the rest of the world that \u201cwhat America says matters.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey made it clear that we can and we must complete this mission and we will, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve ordered them to do,\u201d Mr. Biden said of his military advisers. \u201cWe will not be deterred by terrorists. We will not let them stop our mission. We will continue the evacuation.\u201d",
      "Mr. Biden said that the United States would continue to try to help Americans and others escape Afghanistan after the military leaves the country, in part by seeking to cooperate with the Taliban in bringing them out. He said that the Taliban, at least for now, appeared to be interested in cooperating with the United States and other Western nations.",
      "The Taliban, Mr. Biden said, are eager for economic aid and other help as they try to once again rule the country in the months ahead. That gives the United States leverage over the Taliban that could help in finding and evacuating Americans and other personnel, he said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of reasons why they have reached out, not just to us, but to others as to why it would be continued in their interests to get more of the personnel we want to get out,\u201d he said.",
      "In the past week, as Mr. Biden defended the way his administration has handled the withdrawal of forces from Afghanistan, he vowed that \u201cany attack on our forces or disruption of our operations at the airport will be met with a swift and forceful response.\u201d",
      "It was unclear on Thursday whether a military response of any kind was already in the works. But military officials said that U.S. troops on the ground had the capacity to strike back while also securing the airport.",
      "Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., the head of the U.S. Central Command, said the military would pursue those responsible for the attack. And Mr. Biden later suggested that he would not let the attack pass without a response, though he gave no timeline for action.",
      "Mr. Biden on Thursday asked for a moment of silence to remember those who died.",
      "\u201cEach one of these women and men of our armed forces are the heirs of that tradition,\u201d he said, \u201cof sacrifice, of volunteering to go into harm\u2019s way, to risk everything, not for glory, not for profit, but to defend what we love and the people that we love.\u201d",
      "Pentagon officials described the bombing at the airport as a \u201ccomplex attack\u201d that included at least two explosions and gunfire by ISIS-K fighters at Americans and civilians.",
      "Mr. Biden received word of the worsening situation Thursday morning as he met with top national security advisers for a regularly scheduled update on how the evacuation was going, officials said.",
      "The bad news \u2014 punctuated online by gruesome videos of dead bodies outside of the walls around the airport \u2014 continued throughout the day amid unconfirmed reports of other explosions near the airport and a steadily rising toll of injured and dead, many of them Afghan civilians who had been desperately waiting for a chance to evacuate.",
      "Throughout the morning, Mr. Biden huddled with Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as well as other top aides for updates about the explosions and what they might mean for the last days of the frantic evacuation effort underway in Afghanistan.",
      "After word came of the attacks, the president\u2019s schedule was quickly upended.",
      "Less than 15 minutes before Mr. Biden was set to meet with Naftali Bennett, the new prime minister of Israel, the White House announced that the meeting had been delayed. It was later postponed until Friday. And a meeting between Mr. Biden and some of the nation\u2019s governors was canceled. The daily briefing by Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, was delayed until after Mr. Biden delivered his remarks Thursday evening."

    "title": "Demand Surges for Deworming Drug for Covid, Despite Scant Evidence It Works",
    "content": [
      "For the past week, Dr. Gregory Yu, an emergency physician in San Antonio, has received the same daily requests from his patients, some vaccinated for Covid-19 and others unvaccinated: They ask him for ivermectin, a drug typically used to treat parasitic worms that has repeatedly failed in clinical trials to help people infected with the coronavirus.",
      "Dr. Yu has refused the ivermectin requests, he said, but he knows some of his colleagues have not. Prescriptions for ivermectin have seen a sharp rise in recent weeks, jumping to more than 88,000 per week in mid-August from a prepandemic baseline average of 3,600 per week, according to researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Some pharmacists are even reporting shortages of the drug. Travis Walthall, a pharmacist in Kuna, Idaho, a town of about 20,000 people, said that this summer alone he had filled more than 20 ivermectin prescriptions, up from two or three in a typical year. For the past week he has not been able to obtain the drug from his suppliers; they were all out.",
      "Mr. Walthall was astonished, he said, at how many people were willing to take an unapproved drug for Covid. \u201cI\u2019m like, gosh, this is horrible,\u201d he said.",
      "While sometimes given to humans in small doses for head lice, scabies and other parasites, ivermectin is more commonly used in animals. Physicians are raising alarms about a growing number of people getting the drug from livestock supply centers, where it can come in highly concentrated paste or liquid forms.",
      "Calls to poison control centers about ivermectin exposures have risen dramatically, jumping fivefold over their baseline in July, according to C.D.C. researchers, who cited data from the American Association of Poison Control Centers.",
      "Dr. Shawn Varney, a toxicologist and medical director for the South Texas Poison Center, said that in 2019 his center received 191 calls about exposure to ivermectin; so far this year the center has received 260 calls and is on pace to reach 390 by the end of the year. The vast majority of the recent calls came from people who took a veterinary product in an attempt to treat or prevent Covid-19.",
      "\u201cEveryone wants some cure for Covid because it\u2019s such a devastating illness,\u201d Dr. Varney said. \u201cI plead with people to stop using ivermectin and get the vaccine because it\u2019s the best protection we have at this point. Everything else is risk after risk.\u201d",
      "Dr. Varney said people calling the poison control center after taking ivermectin sometimes reported nausea, muscle pain and diarrhea. He noted that there have been ivermectin overdose deaths in the past, though he did not know of any specifically associated with Covid-19.",
      "The biggest risk, he added, comes from people taking the livestock product and ingesting a far higher dose than is appropriate for humans \u2014 sometimes 10 to 15 times the amount that a capsule approved for humans might contain.",
      "\u201cPeople are going to animal feed stores and getting a formulation that\u2019s highly concentrated because it\u2019s for 1,000-pound animals,\u201d Dr. Varney said. \u201cThey\u2019re opening themselves to great potential harm.\u201d",
      "Ivermectin was introduced as a veterinary drug in the late 1970s, and the discovery of its effectiveness in combating certain parasitic diseases in humans won the 2015 Nobel Prize for medicine.",
      "Though it has not been shown to be effective in treating Covid, people are now clamoring to get the drug, trading tips in Facebook groups and on Reddit. Some physicians have compared the phenomenon to last year\u2019s surge of interest in hydroxychloroquine, though there are more clinical trials evaluating ivermectin.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration weighed in last week. \u201cYou are not a horse,\u201d the agency tweeted, with a warning explaining that ivermectin is not F.D.A.-approved for treating or preventing Covid-19 and that taking large doses can cause serious harm.",
      "A recent review of 14 ivermectin studies, with more than 1,600 participants, concluded that none provided evidence of the drug\u2019s ability to prevent Covid, improve patient conditions or reduce mortality. Another 31 studies are still underway to test the drug.",
      "\u201cThere is great interest in repurposing well-known inexpensive drugs such as ivermectin that are readily available as an oral tablet,\u201d Maria Popp and Stephanie Weibel, the authors of the review, said in an email to The Times. \u201cEven if these circumstances seem ideal, the results from the available clinical studies carried out so far cannot confirm the widely advertised benefits.\u201d",
      "One of the largest trials studying ivermectin for Covid-19 treatment, called the Together Trial, was halted by the data safety monitoring board on Aug. 6 because the drug had been shown to be no better than a placebo at preventing hospitalization or prolonged stay in the emergency room. Dr. Edward Mills, a professor at McMaster University who led the study, which enrolled more than 1,300 patients, said the team would have discontinued it earlier were it not for the level of public interest in ivermectin.",
      "\u201cThe data safety person said, \u2018This is now futile and you\u2019re offering no benefit to patients involved in the trial,\u2019\u201d Dr. Mills said.",
      "Another study of the drug found that ivermectin could be fairly benign unless taken at high doses. Dr. Eduardo L\u00f3pez-Medina, a researcher at the Center for Pediatric Infectious Diseases in Colombia, led a randomized control trial for the study last spring on the effects of ivermectin and found that it had no statistically significant effect on reducing the duration of Covid symptoms. But he also found that there was no statistically significant increase in adverse events for the patients receiving ivermectin, though they were taking a fairly high dose of 300 micrograms per kilogram.",
      "\u201cIt appears to be a safe medication, but that is not enough to prescribe it openly,\u201d Dr. L\u00f3pez-Medina said. \u201cPeople should use it in trials but not necessarily to treat patients. The data is not robust enough to support its use.\u201d",
      "Researchers and physicians are particularly alarmed by people seeking out ivermectin as a form of possible prevention or treatment instead of getting one of the highly effective Covid vaccines. The F.D.A. fully approved the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid vaccine for people 16 and older last week, and an approval of Moderna\u2019s vaccine is expected in the coming weeks.",
      "\u201cThe only functional strategy we have for getting control of Covid-19 is vaccination,\u201d said Dr. Irwin Redlener, a physician in New York and founding director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University. \u201cIf people are not getting vaccinated because of nonsense they\u2019re reading on the internet, that interferes with our ability to get this pandemic under control.\u201d"

      "Hurricane Ida\u2019s landfall Sunday brought dangerous wind, storm surge and rain to the Gulf Coast exactly 16 years after the arrival of Hurricane Katrina, one of the most costly natural disasters in American history, which left more than 1,800 dead and did more than $100 billion in damage.",
      "The overall impact of storm surge from Ida is predicted to be somewhat less severe than that from Katrina. The 2005 storm was blowing at Category 5 strength in the Gulf of Mexico before weakening as it approached landfall, so it generated enormous storm surge, reaching more than 20 feet in parts of the Mississippi coast. Current projections put the potential storm surge of Ida at 12 to 16 feet in the worst areas.",
      "\u201cFifteen-foot sure can do a lot of damage,\u201d said Barry Keim, a professor at Louisiana State University and Louisiana State Climatologist. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be nothing in comparison with Katrina\u2019s surge.\u201d",
      "Improvements to the levee system following Katrina have made the New Orleans metro area better prepared for storm surge. But the areas that are likely to receive the most severe surge from Ida may be less equipped to handle it than the area that was hit by Katrina, said Dr. Keim.",
      "Ida made landfall to the west of where Katrina struck, bringing the most severe storm surge to the Louisiana coast west of the Mississippi River rather than east of the river, as Katrina did.",
      "\u201cWe are testing a different part of the flood protection in and around southeast Louisiana than we did in Katrina,\u201d Dr. Keim said. \u201cSome of the weak links in this area maybe haven\u2019t been quite as exposed.\u201d",
      "While the impacts of Ida\u2019s storm surge are expected to be less severe than Katrina\u2019s, Ida\u2019s winds and rain are predicted to exceed those that pummeled the Gulf Coast in 2005. Ida made landfall as a Category 4 storm with sustained winds around 150 miles an hour; Katrina came ashore as a Category 3 with winds of 125 m.p.h.",
      "\u201cIt could be quite devastating \u2014 especially some of those high-rise buildings are just not rated to sustain that wind load,\u201d said Jamie Rhome, acting deputy director of the National Hurricane Center.",
      "The severe damage from Hurricane Laura, which struck southwest Louisiana last year as a Category 4 storm, was caused primarily by high winds. The storm caused 42 deaths and damage costing more than $19 billion.",
      "Ida\u2019s rainfall also threatens to exceed Katrina\u2019s highs.",
      "The National Hurricane Center estimates that Ida will drench the Gulf Coast with 8 to 16 inches of rain and perhaps as much as 20 inches in some places. Katrina brought 5 to 10 inches of rain, with more than 12 inches in some areas.",
      "\u201cThat is a lot of rainfall,\u201d Mr. Rhome said of the forecast for Ida. \u201cAbsolutely the flash flood potential in this case is high, very high.\u201d Combined with storm surge, he said, that much rain could have a \u201chuge and devastating impact to those local communities.\u201d"

    "title": "All in or All Out? Biden Saw No Middle Ground in Afghanistan.",
    "content": [
      "As the American military withdrawal from Afghanistan capping an ill-fated 20-year war turned uglier and deadlier in recent days, President Biden has stood by his decision but at the same time repeatedly singled out one person in particular to blame: his predecessor.",
      "Because President Donald J. Trump struck an agreement with the Taliban last year to pull out, Mr. Biden has insisted that he had no choice but to abide by the deal he inherited or send tens of thousands of American troops back to Afghanistan to risk their lives in a \u201cforever war.\u201d It was, in other words, all in or all out.",
      "But that reductionist formula has prompted a profound debate over whether the mayhem in Kabul, the capital, was in fact inevitable or the result of a failure to consider other options that might have ended in a different outcome. The unusual confluence of two presidents of rival parties sharing the same goal and same approach has led to second-guessing and finger-pointing that may play out for years to come in history books yet unwritten.",
      "In framing the decision before him as either complete withdrawal or endless escalation, Mr. Biden has been telling the public that there was in fact no choice at all because he knew that Americans had long since grown disenchanted with the Afghanistan war and favored getting out. The fact that Mr. Trump was the one to leave behind a withdrawal agreement has enabled Mr. Biden to try to share responsibility.",
      "\u201cThere was only the cold reality of either following through on the agreement to withdraw our forces or escalating the conflict and sending thousands more American troops back into combat in Afghanistan, lurching into the third decade of conflict,\u201d Mr. Biden said as the Taliban seized Kabul this month.",
      "Critics consider that either disingenuous or at the very least unimaginative, arguing that there were viable alternatives, even if not especially satisfying ones, that may not have ever led to outright victory but could have avoided the disaster now unfolding in Kabul and the provinces.",
      "\u201cThe administration is presenting the choices in a way that is, at best, incomplete,\u201d said Meghan O\u2019Sullivan, a deputy national security adviser under President George W. Bush who oversaw earlier stages of the Afghan war. \u201cNo one I knew was advocating the return of tens of thousands of Americans into \u2018open combat\u2019 with the Taliban.\u201d",
      "Instead, some, including the current military leadership of Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, asserted that keeping a relatively modest force of as few as 3,000 to 4,500 troops along with the extensive use of drones and close air support could have enabled Afghan security forces to continue holding off the Taliban without putting Americans at much risk.",
      "\u201cThere was an alternative that could have prevented further erosion and likely enabled us to roll back some of the Taliban gains in recent years,\u201d said Gen. David H. Petraeus, the retired commander of American forces in Afghanistan and former C.I.A. director who argued the mission was making progress while serving alongside Mr. Biden under President Barack Obama.",
      "\u201cWith the Afghans doing the fighting on the front lines and the U.S. providing assistance from the air,\u201d he added, \u201csuch a force posture would have been quite sustainable in terms of the expenditure of blood and treasure.\u201d",
      "But the White House rejected such a middle ground, contending that it amounted to more war. At her briefing on Friday, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said the only real choice was sending tens of thousands more Americans to \u201cpotentially lose their lives\u201d or getting out.",
      "\u201cThere are of course other options, but there are consequences to every option,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is my point.\u201d As for the critics, she said, \u201cI think it\u2019s easy to play back seat\u201d driver.",
      "Senator Christopher S. Murphy, a Democrat of Connecticut who supports Mr. Biden\u2019s withdrawal, said those arguing to keep troops in Afghanistan were the ones who failed to win the war for two decades and perpetually pushed to stay even though \u201cwe have been losing for six to eight years.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo me, it\u2019s the same game,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cEverybody\u2019s got a plan. But I\u2019ve been working on this long enough to know everybody\u2019s plans are\u201d awful, he added, using an expletive. \u201cThe reality is inescapable.\u201d",
      "Mr. Biden was the third president in a row determined to finally end the war in Afghanistan, which has cost the lives of more than 2,400 American troops and an estimated 240,000 Afghans, and as much as $2 trillion. In recent years, though, the conflict had evolved into an uneasy status quo with a far smaller American footprint. After drawdowns beginning under Mr. Obama, just a fraction of the troops there at the peak were left, yet military strategists said they had an outsize impact in keeping Afghan security forces in the fight without engaging in as much combat themselves.",
      "Fewer than 100 American troops died in combat in Afghanistan over the past five years, roughly the equivalent of the number of Americans currently dying from Covid-19 every two hours. Until the devastating attack this week by ISIS-K at the Kabul airport killed 13 American service members, the military had suffered no combat deaths since the Trump agreement was signed.",
      "Under the four-page deal signed in February 2020, Mr. Trump agreed to withdraw all American troops by May 1, 2021, lift sanctions and compel the release of 5,000 prisoners held by the Afghan government, which was cut out of the negotiations. The Taliban committed to not attacking American troops on the way out or letting terrorist groups use Afghanistan as a base to attack the United States.",
      "While the Taliban agreed to talk with the Afghan government, nothing in the publicly released part of the deal prevented it from taking over the country by force as it ultimately did and reimposing its repressive regime of torture, murder and subjugation of women. It was such a one-sided bargain that even Mr. Trump\u2019s former national security adviser H.R. McMaster called it a \u201csurrender agreement.\u201d",
      "Following the deal, Mr. Trump reduced American forces in Afghanistan to 4,500 from 13,000. Eager to be the president to end the war, he signed a memo to the Pentagon instructing it to pull out all remaining forces by Jan. 15 before leaving office, but was talked out of it by advisers. Instead, he ordered the force drawn down to 2,500 troops in his final days, although about 3,500 actually remained.",
      "For Mr. Biden, inheriting such a small force in Afghanistan meant that commanders were already left with too few troops to respond to a renewed Taliban offensive against American forces, which he deemed certain to come if he jettisoned Mr. Trump\u2019s agreement, requiring him to send thousands more troops back in, officials said.",
      "While he has suggested he had little choice because of the Trump agreement, Mr. Biden in fact was already determined to pull out of Afghanistan regardless and acknowledged in a recent interview with ABC News that \u201cI would have tried to figure out how to withdraw those troops\u201d even if his predecessor had not negotiated a deal with the Taliban.",
      "His views were shaped by his experience as vice president in 2009 arguing against the temporary troop surge that Mr. Obama ordered to Afghanistan. Mr. Biden emerged from that episode soured on the military and the war, convinced that the generals had rolled Mr. Obama by making it politically impossible not to go along with more troops.",
      "Democrats who once worked with Mr. Biden said they assumed that his mind therefore was already made up on Afghanistan when he took office in January and that his current advisers, knowing that, did not push back hard. But aides to the president insisted that while he did have strong views, he engaged in a methodical policy process to test his own assumptions and explore alternatives, repeatedly insisting there be \u201cno stone left unturned.\u201d",
      "Mr. Biden assigned Jake Sullivan, his national security adviser, to run an interagency examination of Afghanistan policy that resulted in 10 meetings of department deputies, three cabinet-level meetings and four meetings in the Situation Room that included the president.",
      "The Biden team considered other options, including keeping a small presence of troops for counterterrorism operations or to support Afghan security forces, but reasoned that was just \u201cmagical thinking\u201d and would take more troops than was sustainable. They discussed whether to renegotiate the Trump agreement to extract more concessions but the Taliban made clear it would not return to the bargaining table and considered the Trump deal binding.",
      "Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers also considered extending the withdrawal deadline until the winter, after the traditional fighting season was over, to make the transition less dangerous for the Afghan government. The Afghanistan Study Group, a bipartisan congressionally chartered panel that was led by Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., a retired Joint Chiefs chairman and that included Ms. O\u2019Sullivan, in February recommended extending the May 1 deadline and seeking better conditions before pulling out.",
      "But Mr. Biden was warned by security specialists that the longer it took to withdraw after a decision was announced, the more dangerous it would become, aides said, so he extended it only until Aug. 31.",
      "Particularly influential on Mr. Biden, aides said, were a series of intelligence assessments he requested about Afghanistan\u2019s neighbors and near neighbors, which found that Russia and China wanted the United States to remain bogged down in Afghanistan.",
      "At the end of the day, then, the officials said every option eventually led to one of the two ultimate alternatives \u2014 get out altogether, as Mr. Trump had agreed to do, or prepare for a prolonged and more dangerous shooting war with many more troops. While not everyone in the room preferred Mr. Biden\u2019s path, officials maintained that everyone was heard.",
      "\u201cBiden basically faced the same issue that Trump faced,\u201d said Vali Nasr, who was a senior adviser to Richard C. Holbrooke, Mr. Obama\u2019s special representative on Afghanistan and Pakistan, \u201cand his answer was the same \u2014 we\u2019re not going to go back in, we have to get out.\u201d",
      "Republican criticism now, he added, was brazenly hypocritical. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who released all these Taliban commanders, they\u2019re the ones who signed this deal,\u201d he said.",
      "Mark T. Esper, a defense secretary under Mr. Trump, agreed that the deal was flawed and in fact argued against drawing down further in the final months of the last administration before being fired in November. In recent days, he said, \u201cthere were more options available to President Biden\u201d than simply continuing Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal.",
      "\u201cHe could have tried to go back to the table with the Taliban and renegotiate,\u201d Mr. Esper said on CNN. \u201cHe could have demanded, as I argued, that they agree to the conditions they established or they agreed to in the agreement and that we use military power to compel them to do that.\u201d",
      "At this point, the die is cast. Mr. Biden made his choice. He wanted to be the president to end America\u2019s longest war. Right or wrong, he has done so and on that, there is no middle ground."

    "content": [
      "JEFFERSON PARISH, La. \u2014 Jordan Roque pulled his Chevy pickup truck onto the last stretch of highway outside of town that was not inundated by water on Monday, hauling an airboat. Hurricane Ida had turned the road into a makeshift boat launch, and Mr. Roque was on a mission to find his relatives.",
      "His aunt and uncle, Diane and Buddy Nolan, had ridden out the fierce Category 4 storm at home in the hardy fishing village of Jean Lafitte. No one had heard from the Nolans since Sunday morning, and now the village, along with much of the southeastern Louisiana bayou area, was underwater.",
      "The authorities had rescued more than 70 people in Jean Lafitte and the surrounding communities, said Cynthia Lee Sheng, the Jefferson Parish president, after eight feet of water overtopped levees, sending several hundred people into attics and onto roofs. At least one person, an older woman, died in her home, Ms. Lee Sheng said. The parish had received more than 200 calls for rescue since Sunday.",
      "Across the path of Ida\u2019s destruction, the weathered and storm-weary people of the northern Gulf Coast waded out of flooded communities on Monday and surveyed the damage left by one of the most fearsome hurricanes to strike the region since Katrina 16 years ago. New Orleans and its hardened storm infrastructure appeared to have held up, though the city had no electricity. But with parts of Louisiana still unreachable, the full extent of the wreckage remained unclear.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s never been as bad as it is this time,\u201d said Jesse Touro, 62, who was rescued from Jean Lafitte after riding out storms in town for the past 12 years. He sounded exhausted as he rode a parish bus to find some sort of shelter. \u201cNone of them like this one,\u201d he repeated.",
      "Several small towns in the southern half of the parish, outside the giant storm protection system encircling New Orleans and some of its suburbs, were inundated. Dozens of residents watched as floodwaters advanced, waiting for rescues that did not start until daybreak.",
      "New Orleans itself had been bruised but not beaten. Tree limbs and debris clogged the streets from the Bywater neighborhood to Uptown. In the French Quarter, the streets seemed to have been washed almost clean. A few New Orleanians had begun venturing out to walk their dogs, ride bikes and assess the state of things early on Monday. Though the city looked sturdy and dry on the outside, many of the problems were unfolding indoors, where the lights could be out for days.",
      "In Houma, a small city about 60 miles southwest of New Orleans, Craig Adams, 53, had planned to spend Saturday night in his beige trailer, but his daughter begged him at 9 p.m., as the storm\u2019s arrival was imminent, to seek shelter somewhere sturdier. On Monday, he was thankful she had. The two-bedroom trailer was wrecked, with only the air-conditioner intact among piles of mangled furniture, kitchen supplies and personal belongings.",
      "\u201cEvery little thing that I owned and had, it\u2019s gone,\u201d Mr. Adams said. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to start all over again. You always see other people going through this on the news. You never think it\u2019s going to be you \u2014 until it is.\u201d",
      "Grand Isle, a narrow beachy islet of stilt-raised homes facing the Gulf of Mexico, near where Ida came ashore, could not be reached by road, which was underwater, or by air, because there was nowhere for a helicopter to land, said Sheriff Joseph P. Lopinto III of Jefferson Parish.",
      "He sent the chopper anyway to see if it could spot his 10 deputies who remained in a bunker on the isle during the storm. There were reports that its roof had blown off. But the deputies gave the helicopter crew a thumbs up on Monday, Sheriff Lopinto said in an interview with WWL radio. He told The New York Times he might have his team drop radios by helicopter so deputies on the isle could communicate.",
      "Ms. Lee Sheng estimated that about 40 people had chosen not to evacuate Grand Isle.",
      "In Jean Lafitte, a village of about 2,000 people, about 400 residents initially refused the mandatory evacuation order, according to the sheriff. But he expected fewer actually stayed once they saw Ida\u2019s strength.",
      "\u201cWe did rescue missions all today,\u201d Sheriff Lopinto said. \u201cBut the water has stabilized. It\u2019s not coming anymore. In fact, it\u2019s receding.\u201d",
      "Some of those who stayed behind still had no plans to leave. Cody Lauricella, a 30-year-old native of bayou country, sailed the 19-foot fishing trawler he usually uses to catch trout and flounder back and forth to Jean Lafitte throughout the day to help people get out. He went all the way to lower Lafitte, he said, but found few takers for a boat ride.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of people that are still there and OK, sitting on the porch, waving at us,\u201d Sheriff Lopinto said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of living in this community. They understand that.\u201d",
      "Mr. Roque felt certain his aunt and uncle, whom he lovingly described as \u201chippies,\u201d would be all right. \u201cThey have good knowledge of what they\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. Their house, like others in the village, was elevated, and their neighbor had a boat.",
      "But he worried anyway.",
      "\u201cThey were being stubborn \u2014 everyone told them to leave, but they were like, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re staying,\u2019\u201d Mr. Roque, 23, said. \u201cWe just want to make sure.\u201d",
      "LaPlace, a town of quiet subdivisions on the eastern bank of the Mississippi River where many evacuees from New Orleans settled after Katrina, saw many of those homes mangled and streets flooded by Ida. On Whitlow Court, a strip of mobile homes, every truck attempting to drive down the street stirred a wake. The water was out. So was the electricity. No one had cellphone service.",
      "David Sanford, who has lived in the neighborhood for eight years, considered himself something of a hurricane veteran, having lived on the Florida coast, in Pensacola, before moving to Louisiana. Even so, Ida terrified him. The storm had his mobile home vibrating \u2014 then it popped a skylight over the bathroom, dumping water inside.",
      "\u201cIt was just rough,\u201d Mr. Sanford, 64, recounted, sitting back on a dry patch at the end of the street on Monday. \u201cThis one right here was the worst one I\u2019ve been in.\u201d The wind was howling, he said, and seemed to never stop. \u201cIt didn\u2019t slack up at all,\u201d he said.",
      "Lea Joseph took her children to try to sleep in the trembling car once the power went out; the wind was whipping her house, uprooting trees and peeling roof shingles.",
      "\u201cI felt bad because I should have left with my kids,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m scared. My son is crying. He kept asking, \u2018When is the eye passing, when is the eye passing?\u2019\u201d",
      "Her 13-year-old son, Cesar, showed videos he had shared with friends on Snapchat of the wind and water descending on the family\u2019s home. In them, his 11-year-old brother, Juan, kept calling out, \u201cHold the door, hold the door,\u201d terrified of the storm\u2019s bluster.",
      "\u201cI was crying,\u201d Juan recalled as he stood on the flooded street, the water lapping over his rubber boots.",
      "\u201cNever again,\u201d Ms. Joseph said. \u201cNever again.\u201d"

      "When I arrived at my first campsite in Wyoming\u2019s Teton Range, some 17 miles from the trailhead, I fully expected to collapse into my sleeping bag. My feet ached, my shoulders were cramping from the weight of my pack and, despite having spent much of the day hiking above 9,000 feet, I had yet to fully adjust to the altitude. I quickly set up my tent, pried my boots off and climbed inside.",
      "Instead of nodding off, though, I glanced out through the mesh screen and found myself entranced by the view: Framed in the distance \u2014 as if perfectly arranged in a picture window \u2014 was the imposing peak of Grand Teton, towering above the surrounding spires.",
      "So began what felt like a nightlong play in five acts, with the Tetons occupying center stage: the clarity of early evening, the dusky glow of sunset, the gradual emergence of the Milky Way, a saturated set of predawn hues and, finally, crisp streaks of early-morning light.",
      "A day earlier, I\u2019d waded through overflowing parking lots and crowded boardwalks in Yellowstone National Park, edging my way to spectacular views of Grand Prismatic Spring and the geysers in Norris Basin.",
      "But here in the backcountry, some 50 miles south, away from the popular hikes along John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial Parkway, the main thoroughfare that connects Yellowstone with the Teton Range, I was experiencing in near solitude what Rockefeller \u2014 who donated tens of thousands of acres to Grand Teton National Park \u2014 once described in a letter.",
      "\u201cThe Teton Mountains are, to my way of thinking, quite the grandest and most spectacular mountains I have ever seen,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhen viewed over the vast expanse of sagebrush which covers the valley, or with Jackson Lake and the marshes in the foreground, they present a picture of ever-changing beauty which is to me beyond compare.\u201d",
      "Mile for mile, the Teton Crest Trail is among the most scenic multiday hikes to be found anywhere in America, encompassing mountain passes, epic ridgelines, dense forests, glaciers, snowfields, endless alpine scenery, towering peaks, glacially carved canyons, a constant array of wildflowers, breathtaking mountain lakes and an abundance of wildlife, including moose, bighorn sheep, mule deer, marmots and pika \u2014 as well as grizzly and black bears.",
      "Most hikers complete the trail in four or five days, heeding the National Park Service\u2019s advice to expect to travel no more than two miles per hour.",
      "In early August, a friend and I endeavored to complete it in three days.",
      "Permits are required for overnight stays in the backcountry of Grand Teton National Park, and securing campsites along the Teton Crest Trail is a competitive process. Having missed the window for advance reservations, we aimed instead for a first-come, first-serve permit, which entailed lining up at one of the park\u2019s visitors centers on the day before the hike at 6 a.m. \u2014 two hours before the office opened. (I was first in line but still only received one of our two preferred sites, necessitating some slight tinkering with our hiking plans.)",
      "There\u2019s another option, though. Because the trail passes in and out of the national park, hikers looking to forgo the permit process can instead camp (for free) in the stretches of the trail that fall in Bridger-Teton and Caribou-Targhee National Forests.",
      "If you\u2019ve seen a photograph of the Tetons, which run north and south along the western edge of Wyoming, it was likely taken from one of the popular and easily accessible overlooks to the east of the mountains: Schwabacher Landing, Mormon Row, the Snake River Overlook, Oxbow Bend. Seen from an eastern vantage, Grand Teton, the tallest of the peaks, rises nearly a mile and a half above the adjacent plains. (The Tetons\u2019 abrupt rise appears especially dramatic because of a lack of significant foothills.)",
      "The Teton Crest Trail, on the other hand, offers hikers a look at the peaks from a western vantage \u2014 a view earned only by hiking up steep canyons or over a series of arduous passes. On this less trafficked side, the mountains offer up a greater variety of scenery, including the pristine isolation of Lake Solitude, scattered scree fields and the eerily barren landscape surrounding the 10,400-foot Hurricane Pass.",
      "Relative solitude, of course, is one of the trail\u2019s other draws. Grand Teton National Park welcomed 3.3 million visitors in 2020, claiming fifth place \u2014 ahead of Grand Canyon \u2014 on the list of the country\u2019s most-visited national parks. Some parts of the park, including the once little-known Delta Lake, have been so inundated by ever-growing crowds that they\u2019ve helped spawn campaigns against geo-tagging their locations in photos shared on social media.",
      "Given its remoteness and the limits on available permits, the Teton Crest Trail, by contrast, is well insulated from the threat of overcrowding. As expected, we encountered only a handful of other hikers along the southern stretches of the trail. (We started at the Phillips Pass Trailhead, though some hikers opt to trim a few miles \u2014 and a few thousand feet in elevation gain \u2014 by taking a tram or a gondola up from Teton Village.) Only near the northern terminus of our route, in Paintbrush Canyon, which is popular with day hikers, did the trail begin to feel even remotely congested.",
      "Fittingly, my hiking companion, Darius Nabors, and I enjoyed the most serene moment of the trip at Lake Solitude, which we reached just before sunrise on our third day. Sitting on a rocky peninsula that juts into the lake, we watched in silence as the sun rose above the enclosing peaks, gradually filling the basin around us with light.",
      "By our back-of-the-envelope calculation, given that only a few campsites put the lake in reach of a reasonable hike before sunrise, it\u2019s a scene that perhaps only a hundred people witness each year.",
      "From Lake Solitude we climbed steadily for more than two miles \u2014 on a section of the path built in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps, a Depression-era government work program \u2014 to Paintbrush Divide, which, at 10,700 feet, marks the Teton Crest Trail\u2019s highest point.",
      "We paused and removed our packs to take in the breathtaking 360-degree views, reveling in the fact that the rest of the hike, to our endpoint at String Lake, would be almost entirely downhill.",
      "Reflecting on the completion of the Skyline Trail \u2014 a precursor to the Teton Crest Trail \u2014 in 1933, Fritiof Fryxell, who served as Grand Teton National Park\u2019s first naturalist, summarized its appeal. \u201cIn traversing this loop,\u201d he wrote, \u201cone completely encircles the Three Tetons and adjacent high peaks, viewing them from all sides. In this way one learns to know these peaks with an intimacy impossible to the visitor who contents himself with distant views.\u201d",
      "And it was true: As we drove south toward the town of Jackson, having completed the trail, and glanced to the west, catching sight of the Tetons from their distant and best-known angle, the peaks felt infinitely more familiar, infinitely more real \u2014 as if they\u2019d finally emerged from the two-dimensional image that for years had been seared in my mind.",

    "title": "In Louisiana, Rescue Workers Search for Those Stranded by Hurricane Ida",
    "content": [
      "NEW ORLEANS \u2014 Rescue teams fanned out across Louisiana on Monday searching for people left stranded in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida, even as New Orleans emerged from its most serious onslaught since Hurricane Katrina confident that its levees had held.",
      "While city residents could take a measure of relief at having dodged a catastrophic flood, several surrounding communities remained cut off by the storm, with the extent of the devastation in those areas still coming into focus. More than a million people, including most of New Orleans, were left without electricity, more than 300,000 were without water and some 2,000 were in shelters, officials said.",
      "New Orleans did not have a functioning 911 system for more than 12 hours on Monday, leaving officials to advise those in need of emergency assistance to go to their nearest fire station.",
      "At least three deaths have been attributed to the storm, officials said: A man died while driving in New Orleans; a woman was found dead in the fishing village of Jean Lafitte, south of the city; and a man was killed in Prairieville, about 20 miles southeast of Baton Rouge, where a tree fell on a house.",
      "All across southeastern Louisiana, officials and volunteers responded, sometimes in boats, to calls from residents stranded in houses swamped in the rising waters. In Jefferson Parish alone, the authorities rescued more than 70 people from flooded neighborhoods.",
      "But the fate of many others remained unclear as rescuers struggled to reach those who had stayed home to ride out the storm. Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana said he expected the death toll to rise \u201cconsiderably.\u201d",
      "Hospitals in the state, already strained by a surge of Covid-19 patients, braced for an influx of people injured in the storm. Louisiana has been dealing with one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in the nation, leaving hospital staff exhausted and available beds limited.",
      "Several hospitals had to be evacuated on Monday, officials said, including St. Anne in Raceland, Chabert in Houma and Lady of the Sea in Galliano, where high winds ripped portions of the roof off on Sunday.",
      "The force of the storm \u2014 with sustained winds reaching as high as 150 miles per hour \u2014 surprised even those accustomed to riding out powerful hurricanes.",
      "\u201cMy roof just flew off, the whole roof,\u201d said Alexis Johnson, speaking outside a civic center in Houma that served as a shelter for residents of the badly hit city about 60 miles southwest of New Orleans. \u201cI stayed still so the wind wouldn\u2019t take me.\u201d Now, she said, she and her daughter have nowhere to go.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t go home,\u201d Ms. Johnson said. \u201cWe have nothing left.\u201d",
      "President Biden, who received a briefing on the storm from local officials on Monday, said that the \u201cpeople in Louisiana and Mississippi are resilient\u201d and that the federal government would \u201cstand with you and the people of the Gulf for as long as it takes for you to recover.\u201d",
      "Dozens of people who stayed in Grand Isle, a narrow beachy islet of homes on stilts facing the Gulf of Mexico, remained cut off and unreachable for much of Monday as phone lines were down and the one road in and out was impassable.",
      "Water had pushed past or \u201covertopped\u201d the levees around small towns in the southern half of Jefferson Parish, said Cynthia Lee Sheng, the parish president, sending several hundred people who were riding out the storm there into attics and onto roofs.",
      "A 10-foot-high surge topped a levee in Plaquemines Parish, southeast of New Orleans, on Sunday, officials there said. That levee is outside the federal storm risk reduction system, in an area where the National Hurricane Center had warned that overtopping of local levees was possible.",
      "No such overtopping took place along any of the 192 miles of flood barriers that hold water back from New Orleans, according to the Flood Protection Authority, the local agency that runs the Hurricane Storm Damage Risk Reduction System. Nor had any of those barriers suffered a structural failure, called a breach.",
      "The levee systems \u201cperformed magnificently,\u201d Governor Edwards said. \u201cThe damage is still catastrophic, but it was primarily wind-driven.\u201d",
      "The levee system was hardened and expanded after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when the city had similarly appeared to have avoided catastrophe from the storm, only to watch as the levees failed and the city flooded the next day.",
      "But the system built at a cost of more than $14 billion to protect New Orleans had worked, according to Elizabeth Zimmerman, who ran disaster operations for the Federal Emergency Management Agency during the Obama administration.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a major accomplishment,\u201d Ms. Zimmerman said. \u201cThe things that were built were a major step forward.\u201d",
      "Yet as Ida moved through the state, the storm caused \u201ccatastrophic transmission damage\u201d to the electrical system, leaving more than a million utility customers without power.",
      "Entergy, a major power company in Louisiana, said on Monday that it would \u201clikely take days to determine the extent of damage to our power grid and far longer to restore electrical transmission to the region.\u201d",
      "All eight transmission lines that bring electricity into New Orleans were knocked out of service by the storm, according to the power utility. On Monday, the company said 216 substations and more than 2,000 miles of transmission lines were out of service. One transmission line that spans the Mississippi River was down.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been here 61 years. I\u2019ve never experienced anything like this before,\u201d Glenn Brady said as he pulled waterlogged rugs and carpets from his home in LaPlace. He recalled watching the storm rip the columns out of his neighbor\u2019s front porch and shoot them through a front window.",
      "\u201cI definitely got a newfound fear for hurricanes,\u201d he said.",
      "In Houma, it was the strong winds and not the rising waters that brought the most destruction. \u201cThe trees and power lines were swaying back and forth and then they finally snapped,\u201d Hannah Carter, 39, said. \u201cIt was horrifying.\u201d",
      "Daylight provided a glimpse of the devastation in this city of about 33,000 people. The storm leveled buildings, smashed trees into homes and filled entire blocks with debris.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t stay here,\u201d said Dusan Roncevic, 47, estimating it would take weeks for officials to restore power and other services to the region.",
      "Ida astonished meteorologists with its rapid intensification in the days before it made landfall on Sunday near Port Fourchon as a Category 4 storm. And it maintained its intensity for longer after coming ashore than is typical for hurricanes, a result of the swampy terrain and the fact it was still growing in strength as it reached the coast.",
      "By Monday, the center of the storm crossed into western Mississippi, slowing and weakening into a tropical depression as it swept northward. Its path is expected to curve northeastward through the evening, and then into the Tennessee Valley on Tuesday.",
      "Though the storm had moved on, New Orleans officials urged residents not to return to a city still struggling to get back on its feet. \u201cNow is not the time for re-entry into the city of New Orleans,\u201d Mayor LaToya Cantrell said during an afternoon news conference.",
      "Most city streets were strewn with a carpet of green leaves and littered with large pieces of debris \u2014 metal roofs, wood fences \u2014 and fallen trees.",
      "By the first hours of Monday, each neighborhood\u2019s fire station was also tasked with a new responsibility. With the city\u2019s 911 lines down, officials mass-texted residents, telling them to seek help in person from the nearest fire station or police officer.",
      "At a fire station on Poland Avenue, a generator powered the lights and kitchen, but its firefighters were reliant on hand-held radios for any communication. \u201cWe\u2019re all in the dark right now,\u201d said one firefighter, who sat near the station\u2019s open garage doors on Monday morning, ready to assist anyone walking up for help.",
      "The system was up and running again by late afternoon.",
      "Some residents who have lived through previous storms said they were taking the power outage and a boil-water advisory in stride.",
      "\u201cGuess what? This is part of life in New Orleans,\u201d Antoine Davis, 58, said as he stopped at Duplantier Ice at the edge of the French Quarter for bags of ice to keep his refrigerator cold. \u201cIf we lived in California, there would be fires and earthquakes. If we lived in Tennessee right now, we\u2019d have floods.\u201d",
      "Over on Elysian Fields Avenue a few blocks from the river, Darrian Rivers, 41, was shaking his head at the damage to his house\u2019s second-floor front porch, now missing one of its large white wooden columns.",
      "He and his neighbors were left wondering if their lives would be put on hold for days or even weeks as they waited for the power to return. \u201cEverybody wants to know what\u2019s next,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the question I keep hearing. \u2018What\u2019s next?\u2019\u201d"

    "title": "",
    "content": [
      "Most of New Orleans went dark on Sunday after Hurricane Ida took out transmission lines and forced power plants offline. It was an all too familiar scene in a city that has often lost power during big storms.",
      "But this was an outage that was never supposed to happen. The utility company Entergy opened a new natural gas power plant in the city last year, pledging that it would help keep the lights on \u2014 even during hot summer days and big storms. It was one of two natural gas plants commissioned in recent years in the New Orleans area, the other one hailed by Gov. John Bel Edwards last year as a \u201csource of clean energy that gives our state a competitive advantage and helps our communities grow.\u201d",
      "The storm raises fresh questions about how well the energy industry has prepared for natural disasters, which many scientists believe are becoming more common because of climate change. This year, much of Texas was shrouded in darkness after a winter storm, and last summer officials in California ordered rolling blackouts during a heat wave.",
      "More than a million residential and commercial customers in Louisiana were without power on Monday afternoon, and Entergy and other utilities serving the state said it would take days to assess the damage to their equipment and weeks to fully restore service across the state. One customer can be a family or a large business, so the number of people without power is most likely many times higher. In neighboring Mississippi, just under 100,000 customers were without power.",
      "Residents and government officials are now asking why the plant didn\u2019t keep electricity flowing to at least some of the city and how all eight transmission lines bringing power to New Orleans from elsewhere went out of service at the same time \u2014 a failure that Entergy blamed on Ida\u2019s \u201ccatastrophic intensity.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf anything happened to the transmission, this gas plant was supposed to supply power to the city of New Orleans,\u201d said Monique Harden, assistant director for public policy at the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, one of the leading organizations fighting the gas plant in the city. \u201cThis is going to require some investigation.\u201d",
      "Entergy did not immediately respond to requests to discuss the gas plant and its transmission lines.",
      "Extreme weather linked to climate change has strained electric grids around the country, compounding the toll of natural disasters by leaving hospitals, governments, people and businesses without electricity for days or weeks. Storms have revealed that energy companies and their regulators have not done enough to harden transmission lines and power plants to withstand extreme temperatures and winds. In some cases, power lines and other utility equipment have caused disasters like some of California\u2019s largest and deadliest wildfires.",
      "In February, a winter storm plunged much of Texas into darkness for days. Dozens of people died, often while trying to stay warm. It quickly became apparent that power plants, natural gas pipelines and other infrastructure were not protected against frigid cold, and that lawmakers had made it impossible for Texas to import power by keeping the state grid largely isolated from the rest of the country to avoid federal oversight.",
      "Energy experts said it was too early to say what happened to Entergy\u2019s New Orleans gas plant and transmission lines and draw lessons from the storm. But natural disasters have highlighted the need for improvements, including making grids less prone to large failures.",
      "\u201cGenerally speaking, you\u2019re never going to be able to construct a system that can withstand absolutely any natural disaster,\u201d said Larry Gasteiger, executive director of Wires, a trade association that represents utilities that build and operate high-voltage transmission lines. \u201cBut it speaks to the need for building out a more resilient system.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration has planned tens of billions of dollars to add more transmission lines to carry more solar and wind power from one region of the country to another. But some energy experts said the increasing frequency of devastating hurricanes, wildfires and other disasters argues against a big investment in power lines and for greater investment in smaller-scale systems like rooftop solar panels and batteries. Because small systems are placed at many homes, businesses, schools and other buildings, some continue to function even when others are damaged, providing much-needed energy during and after disasters.",
      "Susan Guidry, a former member of the New Orleans City Council who voted against the Entergy plant, said she had worried that a storm like Ida could wreak havoc on her city and its energy system. She had wanted the city and utility to consider other options. But she said her fellow Council members and the utility had ignored those warnings.",
      "\u201cThey said that they had dealt with that problem,\u201d Ms. Guidry said. \u201cThe bottom line is they should have instead been upgrading their transmission and investing in renewable energy.\u201d",
      "Numerous community groups and city leaders opposed the gas-fired power plant, which is just south of Interstate 10 and Lake Pontchartrain, bordering predominantly African American and Vietnamese American neighborhoods. Nevertheless, the City Council approved the plant, which began commercial operations in May 2020. It generates power mainly at times of peak demand.",
      "About a year earlier, Entergy opened a larger gas power plant in nearby St. Charles Parish. Leo P. Denault, Entergy\u2019s chairman and chief executive, last year called that plant \u201ca significant milestone along the clean energy journey we began more than 20 years ago.\u201d",
      "Some utilities have turned to burying transmission lines to protect them from strong winds and storms, but Mr. Gasteiger said that was expensive and could cause its own problems.",
      "\u201cGenerally speaking, it\u2019s not that the utilities are not willing to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s that people aren\u2019t willing to pay for it. Usually it\u2019s a cost issue. And undergrounding can make it more difficult to locate and fix\u201d problems.",
      "Big changes to electric grids and power plants are likely to take years, but activists and residents of New Orleans say officials should explore solutions that can be rolled out more quickly, especially as tens of thousands of people face days or weeks without electricity. Some activists want officials to put a priority on investments in rooftop solar, batteries and microgrids, which can power homes and commercial buildings even when the larger grid goes down.",
      "\u201cWe keep walking by the solutions to keep people safe in their homes,\u201d said Logan Atkinson Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer group based in New Orleans. \u201cWhen these events happen, then we\u2019re in crisis mode because instead we\u2019re spending billions of dollars every year now to rebuild the same system that leaves people in the dark, in a dire situation.\u201d",
      "Some residents have already invested in small-scale energy systems for themselves. Julie Graybill and her husband, Bob Smith, installed solar panels and batteries at their New Orleans home after Hurricane Isaac blew through Louisiana in 2012. They lost power for five days after Isaac, at times going to their car for air-conditioning with their two older dogs, said Ms. Graybill, 67, who retired from the Tulane University School of Medicine.",
      "\u201cWe would sit in the car about every hour,\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband said, \u2018We are never doing this again.\u2019\u201d Mr. Smith, 73, who is also retired, worked as an engineer at Royal Dutch Shell, the oil company.",
      "The couple have set up a little power station on their porch so neighbors can charge their phones and other items. Only a few other homes on their street have solar panels, but no one else nearby has batteries, which can store the power that panels generate and dispense it when the grid goes down.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re told we\u2019re not going to have power for three weeks,\u201d Ms. Graybill said. \u201cThe only people who have power are people with generators or solar panels. We lived through Katrina. This is not Katrina, so we\u2019re lucky.\u201d"

    "title": "In New Orleans, Anxiously Watching the Levees As Hurricane Ida Arrives",
    "content": [
      "NEW ORLEANS \u2014 As Hurricane Ida began violently tearing through South Louisiana on Sunday, Kelli Chandler was holed up in a windowless office, waiting and watching for the answer to a question that all of New Orleans was asking: Would the levees \u2014 the newer, stronger, more sophisticated levees \u2014 hold back the storm?",
      "Ms. Chandler, an official in the nerve center of the sprawling $20 billion storm defense system that was upgraded after the misery of Hurricane Katrina, spent hours fielding emails, calls, and texts from a web of officials and agencies that were keeping their eyes on the new system.",
      "The early signs, she said early Sunday evening, were good, but the final answers were far from clear. Ida was not finished with New Orleans. So the waiting and worrying went on. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting peak winds later on tonight,\u201d she said.",
      "The nation\u2019s most flood-scarred city buckled in for a terrifying ride Sunday, its people gripped by an anxiety that was whipping around with the wind. Would Ida amount to a rerun of the epic disaster that no one has forgotten \u2014 and, of all days, on the 16th anniversary of Katrina?",
      "For residents like Erica Smith, the new storm protections offered little assurance. Ms. Smith, 38, had survived Katrina, but, she said, just barely. She had no intention of living through this storm at her house in suburban Metairie. So she had come downtown, seeking the safety of a big hotel. Sunday morning, however, she had to move from one hotel to another. She cowered in the curve of a downtown building, contemplating the harrowing nine-block walk. The wind howled down Carondelet Street.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s horrific,\u201d she said. \u201cThis could be another Katrina.\u201d",
      "The prospect of that \u2014 \u201canother Katrina\u201d \u2014 has haunted New Orleans, and the rest of the nation, since the nightmare flooding of 2005 and the botched government response that followed. And Ida, which made landfall Sunday just south of New Orleans, seemed like a serious contender, with winds that reached 150 miles per hour, and a trajectory that appeared to be headed just west of New Orleans.",
      "But all storms are different, and the extensive investment in a remade storm protection system offered hope. It could seem, on Sunday, like pessimism and optimism were fighting it out like colliding weather systems.",
      "In the Algiers Point neighborhood, directly across the Mississippi River from the French Quarter, windows shook and tree limbs were sent flailing. Steely gray skies were barely visible through the stretch of oak trees lining Opelousas Avenue. Some neighborhood streets were strewn with leaves and broken branches. By Sunday night, power was out in New Orleans.",
      "Many residents evacuated the city before the storm made landfall, but some stayed behind, determined to ride out the storm in their own homes or those of friends or relatives.",
      "Most houses were not boarded up, but residents appeared to have taken to heart officials\u2019 advice to pull trash cans inside, leaving the streets uncommonly empty.",
      "Further into the day, the Mississippi River was whipped into an ocean-like frenzy. Video footage circulated of a ferry that had broken loose from its moorings. Ms. Chandler said a tug would be dispatched to pull it to safety as soon as the winds died down.",
      "Prolonged power outages are expected to have the biggest impact for those who stayed in the city, with food and medicine spoiling in inoperable refrigerators and hot weather making daily life uncomfortable for everyone. Power trouble had already begun on Sunday, as the lights flickered and went out in Algiers, then the 7th Ward, then the 9th Ward.",
      "The Sewerage and Water Board sent a notice just before noon that a number of its stations throughout the city were losing power, which could cause sewers to back up in homes if residents did not reduce the amount of wastewater they send into the system through showers, dishwashing and toilets flushing.",
      "\u201cThese stations will be out of service until the storm passes,\u201d the notice read.",
      "In other parts of the region, the storm\u2019s effects were yet to arrive in force, and officials braced for daybreak Monday, when they would begin to learn the extent of a near-certain trail of misery for a state that was battered by numerous powerful storms last year.",
      "It remained to be seen if New Orleans would be on the list of the hardest hit. On Sunday, Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana expressed optimism that the city would handle the storm on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d The new storm system surrounding New Orleans, with its 350 miles of levees, flood walls, gates and pumps, \u201cwill withstand the storm surge,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been tremendous investment in this system since Hurricane Katrina,\" he said. He added: \u201cThis will be the most severe test of that system.\u201d",
      "There were hopes that Ida might prove mild. One weather forecaster suggested that the result might turn out to be more similar to Hurricane Zeta, a storm that struck in October, blowing through quickly and ferociously, leaving the streets filled with fallen tree branches and downed power lines \u2014 but leaving most of the city intact.",
      "But many residents had a hard time putting faith in the predictions and the experts. Even if the levees held this time, they wondered if the city\u2019s historically troubled pumping system would be able to churn water out of the city before floodwaters rose.",
      "\u201cI just have a really eerie feeling about this one,\u201d said Chris Dier, a local schoolteacher who evacuated his home in the Arabi neighborhood. \u201cI feel like the levees should hold, but again, if they didn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised because we all thought they would hold during Katrina but they didn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "The big hotels around the French Quarter, meanwhile, were experiencing a rarity: rooms and floors full of patrons with New Orleans accents.",
      "Devin Sanville, 51, a chef at Antoine\u2019s Restaurant, the famous Creole restaurant in the French Quarter, had moved with his family into a room in the AC Hotel on the fifth floor. He rode out Katrina on the third floor in the St. Bernard housing projects after fleeing his house, which filled with at least six feet of water.",
      "\u201cI feel like our infrastructure is better than it was 15-16 years ago,\u201d he said. But he emphasized that much of the suffering came after the storm, when so many New Orleanians were left stranded without power or a means of escape.",
      "\u201cI think we can make it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just about people. Preserving lives and people.\u201d",
      "Angela Williams, 55, a New Orleans school bus driver had also come to the hotel for some peace of mind. She said Katrina put 12 feet of water in her Uptown New Orleans home.",
      "On Sunday, the hotel lobby seemed like the best vantage from which to judge whether the city was truly safer than it was in 2005.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to see if it works,\u201d she said of the upgraded flood protection system. \u201cBecause the last hurricane, it didn\u2019t work at all for us.\u201d",

      "There\u2019s a dark joke about this year\u2019s extreme temperatures that has been haunting me for weeks: This is the coldest summer of the rest of our lives.",
      "The prospect is nothing short of terrifying given what this year has wrought.",
      "In June, sky-high temperatures in the Pacific Northwest killed as many as 600 people. Several hikers have been found dead in California in recent weeks, most likely because of temperatures that were above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Globally, July ranked as the hottest month in recorded human history.",
      "So, from my Los Angeles apartment that regularly crosses 85 degrees indoors, I called some climate scientists and asked them, \u201cIs every upcoming summer going to be even hotter than this one?\u201d",
      "The short answer was: Yes, generally.",
      "Vijay Limaye, a climate and health scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, told me that each recent decade had been unmistakably warmer than the one before it, so it\u2019s highly probable that future years will continue to break heat records.",
      "\u201cWe should act like that\u2019s going to be the case: that this will be the coldest summer when we look forward,\u201d he said.",
      "A United Nations report this month found that the Earth is locked into intensifying global warming for the next 30 years because countries have delayed curbing their fossil-fuel emissions for so long. Preventing further warming is within reach, but would require a coordinated and immediate worldwide effort, the report found.",
      "The effects of climate change can be seen locally. The average high temperature in July in L.A. has risen by more than two degrees since the 1960s, as it has in Boston, Washington, D.C., Atlanta and several other cities.",
      "And it will probably keep climbing. In Los Angeles County in 1990, the average annual maximum temperature \u2014 an average of the high each day \u2014 was 74 degrees. In 2090, the average maximum temperature will be somewhere between 80 and 82 degrees, according to state projections.",

      "But still, that doesn\u2019t mean that 2022 in your city will definitely be warmer than 2021 has been.

    "title": "On Death Row in Texas, a Last Request: A Prayer and \u2018Human Contact\u2019",
    "content": [
      "LIVINGSTON, Texas \u2014 John Henry Ramirez and Dana Moore both quote the same passage of the Bible when they explain their friendship. \u201cI was sick and you looked after me,\u201d Jesus says in the book of Matthew, describing God ushering righteous people into eternal life. \u201cI was in prison and you came to visit me.\u201d",
      "Mr. Moore, the pastor of Second Baptist Church in Corpus Christi, has been visiting Mr. Ramirez in prison for more than four years, driving 300 miles northeast to the Allan B. Polunsky Unit in Livingston, where Mr. Ramirez has been on death row for more than a decade. The two men talk about faith and life, speaking through telephone handsets on either side of a thick Plexiglas window in the prison\u2019s visiting room.",
      "Mr. Ramirez, 37, often teases Mr. Moore about his \u201cshort and sweet\u201d prayers, and they discuss recent sermons at the church, where Mr. Ramirez became a member a few years ago. Mr. Moore had to bend the rules to accept his application in absentia, but there was no question for him that Mr. Ramirez was qualified.",
      "Now, the men are planning one last meeting, in the death chamber where the state of Texas plans to execute Mr. Ramirez by lethal injection on Sept. 8. And Mr. Ramirez is asking for something unusual: He wants Mr. Moore to lay hands on him at the moment of his death.",
      "\u201cIt would just be comforting,\u201d Mr. Ramirez said in an interview at the prison. He wants Mr. Moore not just to observe as the fatal drug cocktail snakes through an IV line into his arm \u2014 \u201cpoisoned straight up to death,\u201d as he put it \u2014 but to pray out loud, and hold his hand, or touch his shoulder or foot.",
      "On Aug. 10, Mr. Ramirez filed a federal lawsuit against prison officials for denying his request. The suit claims that the state\u2019s refusal to allow Mr. Moore to lay hands on him burdens his free exercise of religion at the exact moment \u201cwhen most Christians believe they will either ascend to heaven or descend to hell \u2014 in other words, when religious instruction and practice is most needed.\u201d",
      "The two men have never touched; their entire relationship has been conducted through Plexiglas. When they pray, they press their palms together on the window. Mr. Ramirez rarely experiences any kind of physical touch on death row, other than glancing contact with guards when they place handcuffs around his wrists. He greets his visitors with a fist bump on the window, flesh to plastic to flesh. \u201cWe have no human contact back here,\u201d he said.",
      "As a Baptist, Mr. Moore does not believe in a formal sacrament that must be performed to exact specifications on the brink of death, like the Catholic practice of administering the last rites. But he said touch is an integral, organic part of his work. When someone comes forward in a church service for a personal prayer, or when he visits a dying person in the hospital, he holds the person\u2019s hand.",
      "In an affidavit submitted with Mr. Ramirez\u2019s lawsuit, Mr. Moore cited the miraculous healing that Jesus is recorded to have performed through touching the sick, and how he gathered children into his arms to bless them.",
      "\u201cThe power of human touch is more than just physical,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s the way God created us.\u201d",
      "Mr. Ramirez was condemned for stabbing to death a Corpus Christi man named Pablo Castro in 2004. Drunk and high, Mr. Ramirez was driving around with two female friends looking for people to rob when they came upon Mr. Castro taking out the trash at a convenience store where he worked. Mr. Ramirez stabbed him 29 times. Prosecutors described the attack as a robbery that netted $1.25.",
      "Mr. Ramirez evaded law enforcement for three years, fleeing to Mexico and starting a family there. He was captured near the border in 2007, convicted and sentenced to death.",
      "Mr. Ramirez takes responsibility for the crime, which he calls a \u201cheinous murder.\u201d He declined to attribute his actions to his childhood marked by abuse, instability and poverty. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people that live like that and even worse, and they didn\u2019t end up on death row,\u201d he reflected. \u201cThey didn\u2019t end up becoming murderers.\u201d",
      "Mr. Ramirez has studied a variety of religions during his time in prison, from Catholicism to Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He met the Baptist pastor, Mr. Moore, through two longtime church members who had been visiting through a prison ministry; Mr. Ramirez considers the sisters his godmothers. Aspects of Jewish beliefs also resonated with him, and he now considers himself a Messianic Jew, who believes that Jesus is the Messiah.",
      "But he rejects the stereotype of the jailhouse conversion. He always believed in God, he said, even at his lowest moments. \u201cThere are a lot of people that believe there\u2019s a God and just don\u2019t live right,\u201d he said. \u201cI just wasn\u2019t obeying, I wasn\u2019t trying to be good.\u201d",
      "Texas\u2019 approach to spiritual advisers at executions has oscillated over the course of Mr. Ramirez\u2019s time on death row. The state allowed only prison-employed chaplains to be present in the death chamber before 2019. But it employed only Christian and Muslim clerics as chaplains. When a Buddhist inmate named Patrick Murphy argued that the state had violated his rights by not providing access to a Buddhist chaplain, the Supreme Court agreed.",
      "But Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh offered the state an out in a concurring opinion. Texas had two options, he wrote. It could provide a Buddhist chaplain for Mr. Murphy, or it could decline access to the execution chamber to all religious advisers, including Christians and Muslims. Texas took him up on the suggestion, relegating all spiritual advisers to an observation room adjacent to the chamber.",
      "This spring, however, after the Supreme Court stopped another execution over the restrictive policy, the agency changed course again, allowing people on death row access to a spiritual adviser of their choosing.",
      "To advocates for prisoners, the role of a spiritual counselor at the moment of death is profound.",
      "\u201cYou uphold the dignity of the human being, that everyone is worth more than the worst thing they\u2019ve ever done,\u201d said Sister Helen Prejean, an anti-death penalty activist who has served as a spiritual adviser to six inmates on their execution days.",
      "In the last moments of life, she said, what she can offer is her presence. \u201cAt the end, it\u2019s \u2018Look at my face,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone else in that room is there to kill them.\u201d",
      "That presence also generates a moral obligation, Sister Helen said. Unlike state-employed prison chaplains, outside spiritual advisers can be an \u201cindependent voice,\u201d describing what they see in the chamber. \u201cIt\u2019s the secrecy and the distance and the separation that has allowed the death penalty to go on all this time,\u201d she said.",
      "In its response to Mr. Ramirez\u2019s suit, the state claims that strict restrictions in the execution chamber are a security matter, and that Mr. Ramirez\u2019s request opens the door to ever-more-burdensome religious requests.",
      "\u201cEverything surrounding the execution process and the Texas execution protocol is based on safety and security,\u201d said Jeremy Desel, communications director for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.",
      "Mr. Ramirez\u2019s lawyer, Seth Kretzer, pushed back on that argument. \u201cYou\u2019re in the most secure facility in the entire prison system,\u201d he said.",
      "Mr. Ramirez\u2019s plea pits law and order against compassion and respect for individual faith. These contradictory impulses both have a strong influence in Texas, said Kent Ryan Kerley, professor and chair of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Texas at Arlington. \u201cIt\u2019s mercy versus justice, which one do they choose?\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a perfect test case.\u201d",
      "For Mr. Ramirez, it is hard to see the denial as anything but spiteful. \u201cWhat will happen? I\u2019ll have a true spiritual moment at the point of death and you don\u2019t want me to have that?\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to keep that from me, too?\u201d",
      "In a poem he wrote in 2018, he reflected on his deep loneliness in prison:",
      "Comfort me like a hug\nwhile I await the final tug.\nOf this noose around my collar\nwill you notice when I holler?",
      "For now, he awaits his execution in just over a week, or a last-minute reprieve. He is ready to die, he said. \u201cI really do want to get the hell out of here,\u201d he said. \u201cI know where I\u2019m heading anyways. I know what I believe in.\u201d"

    "title": "A New Breed of Crisis: War and Warming Collide in Afghanistan",
    "content": [
      "Parts of Afghanistan have warmed twice as much as the global average. Spring rains have declined, most worryingly in some of the country\u2019s most important farmland. Droughts are more frequent in vast swaths of the country, including a punishing dry spell now in the north and west, the second in three years.",
      "Afghanistan embodies a new breed of international crisis, where the hazards of war collide with the hazards of climate change, creating a nightmarish feedback loop that punishes some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable people and destroys their countries\u2019 ability to cope.",
      "And while it would be facile to attribute the conflict in Afghanistan to climate change, the effects of warming act as what military analysts call threat multipliers, amplifying conflicts over water, putting people out of work in a nation whose people largely live off agriculture, while the conflict itself consumes attention and resources.",
      "\u201cThe war has exacerbated climate change impacts. For 10 years, over 50 percent of the national budget goes to the war,\u201d  Noor Ahmad Akhundzadah, a professor of hydrology at Kabul University, said by phone on Thursday. \u201cNow there is no government, and the future is unclear. Our current situation today is completely hopeless.\u201d",
      "A third of all Afghans face what the United Nations calls crisis levels of food insecurity. Because of the fighting, many people haven\u2019t been able to plant their crops in time. Because of the drought, the harvest this year is certain to be poor. The World Food Program says 40 percent of crops are lost, the price of wheat has gone up by 25 percent, and the aid agency\u2019s own food stock is due to run out by the end of September.",
      "Afghanistan is not the only country to face such compounding misery. Of the world\u2019s 25 nations most vulnerable to climate change, more than a dozen are affected by conflict or civil unrest, according to an index developed by the University of Notre Dame.",
      "In Somalia, pummeled by decades of conflict, there\u2019s been a threefold increase in extreme weather events since 1990, compared to the previous 20 year-period, making it all but impossible for ordinary people to recover after each shock. In 2020, more than a million Somalis were displaced from their homes, about a third because of drought, according to the United Nations.",
      "In Syria, a prolonged drought, made more likely by man-made climate change, according to researchers, drove people out of the countryside and fed simmering antigovernment grievances that led to an uprising in 2011 and ultimately, a full-blown civil war. This year again, drought looms over Syria, particularly its breadbasket region, the northeastern Hassakeh Province.",
      "In Mali, a violent insurgency has made it harder for farmers and herders to deal with a succession of droughts and flood, according to aid agencies.",
      "\u201cThe convergence of climate risks and conflict further worsens food and economic insecurity and health disparities, limits access to essential services, while weakening the capacity of governments, institutions and societies to provide support,\u201d the International Committee of the Red Cross warned in a recent report that examined the combined effects of conflict and climate shocks, including in Mali.",
      "Climate change cannot be blamed for any single war, and certainly not the one in Afghanistan. But rising temperatures, and the weather shocks that come with it, act as what Marshall Burke, a Stanford University professor, calls \u201ca finger on the scale that makes underlying conflict worse.\u201d That is particularly true, he argued, in places that have undergone a long conflict and where government institutions have all but dissolved.",
      "\u201cNone of this means that climate is the only or the most important factor in conflict,\u201d said Dr. Burke, co-author of a 2013 paper looking at the role of climate change in dozens of conflicts across many years. \u201cBut based on this evidence, the international community would be foolish to ignore the threat that a warming climate represents.\u201d",
      "The combination of war and warming compound the risks facing some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable people: According to the United Nations children\u2019s agency, Afghanistan is the 15th riskiest country in the world for children, because of climate hazards, like heat and drought, and a lack of essential services, like health care. Two million Afghan children are malnourished.",
      "That is in sharp contrast to Afghanistan\u2019s part in global warming. An average Afghan produces 0.2 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year, compared to nearly 16 metric tons of the average American.",
      "The collapse of the government has also made Afghanistan\u2019s participation in the next international climate talks entirely uncertain, said one of its members Ahmad Samim Hoshmand. \u201cNow I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not part of any government. What government I should represent?\u201d he said.",
      "Until recently, he had been the government official in charge of enforcing the country\u2019s ban on ozone-depleting substances, like refrigerants used in old air-conditioners and that are banned by the Montreal Protocol, an international agreement that Afghanistan had ratified. Just days before the Taliban seized Kabul, he fled to Tajikistan. The traders of illegal substances whom he helped arrest are now out of prison, keen to exact revenge. He says they will kill him if he returns.",
      "Mr. Hoshmand is now scrambling to emigrate elsewhere. His visa in Tajikistan expires in a matter of weeks. \u201cMy only hope is the ozone community, the Montreal Protocol community, if they can support me,\u201d he said.",
      "Afghanistan\u2019s geography is a study of extreme hazard, from the glacier-peaked Hindu Kush mountains in the north to its melon farms in the west to the arid south, stung by dust storms.",
      "Climate data is sparse for Afghanistan. But a recent analysis based on what little data exists suggests that a decline in spring rains has already afflicted much of the country, but most acutely in the country\u2019s north, where farmers and herders rely almost entirely on the rains to grow crops and water their flocks.",
      "Over the past 60 years, average temperatures have risen sharply, by 1.8 degrees Celsius since 1950 in the country as a whole and by more than 2 degrees Celsius in the south.",
      "\u201cClimate change will make it extremely challenging to maintain \u2014 let alone increase \u2014 any economic and development gains achieved so far in Afghanistan,\u201d the United Nations warned in a 2016 report. \u201cIncreasingly frequent and severe droughts and floods, accelerated desertification, and decreasing water flows in the country\u2019s glacier-dependent rivers will all directly affect rural livelihoods \u2014 and therefore the national economy and the country\u2019s ability to feed itself.\u201d",
      "This is the country\u2019s biggest risk, Dr. Akhundzadah argued. Three-fourths of his compatriots work in agriculture, and any unpredictable weather can be calamitous, all the more so in a country where there hasn\u2019t been a stable government and no safety net to speak of.",
      "The Taliban, for their part, appear more exercised by the need to scrub women\u2019s pictures from billboards than addressing climate hazards.",
      "But climate change is a threat multiplier for the Taliban, too. Analysts say water management will be critical to its legitimacy with Afghan citizens, and it is likely to be one of the most important issues in the Taliban\u2019s relations with its neighbors as well.",
      "Already on the Afghan battlefield, as in many battlefields throughout history, water has been an important currency. The Taliban, in their bid for Herat, a strategic city in the west, repeatedly attacked a dam that is critical for drinking water, agriculture and electricity for the people of the region. Likewise, in Kandahar Province in the south, one of the Taliban\u2019s most critical victories was to seize control of a dam that holds water for drinking and irrigation.",
      "Climate change also stands to complicate the Taliban\u2019s ability to fulfill a key promise: the elimination of opium poppy cultivation. Poppies require far less water than, say, wheat or melons, and they are far more profitable. Poppy farming employs an estimated 120,000 Afghans and brings in an estimated $300-400 million a year, according to the United Nations, and has in turn enriched the Taliban.",
      "Areas under poppy cultivation grew sharply in 2020.",
      "Analysts said the Taliban would seek to use a poppy ban to gain legitimacy from foreign powers, like Qatar and China. But it is likely to face pushback from growers who have few alternatives as the rains become less reliable.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a gigantic political flash point,\u201d said Vanda Felbab-Brown, who studies the region at the Brookings Institution in Washington.",
      "The last drought, in 2018, left four million Afghans in need of food aid and forced 371,000 people to leave their homes, many of whom haven\u2019t returned.",
      "\u201cThe effects of the severe drought are compounded by conflict and the Covid-19 pandemic in a context where half the population were already in need of aid,\u201d the United Nations humanitarian coordinator, Ramiz Alakbarov, said by email from Kabul on Thursday. \u201cWith little financial reserves, people are forced to resort to child labor, child marriage, risky irregular migration exposing them to trafficking and other protection risks. Many are taking on catastrophic levels of debt and selling their assets.\u201d",
      "Dr. Akhundzadah, a father of four, is hoping to emigrate, too. But like his fellow academics, he said he has not worked for foreign governments and has no way to be evacuated from the country. The university is closed. Banks are closed. He is looking for research jobs abroad. For now, there are no commercial flights out of the country.",
      "\u201cTill now I\u2019m OK,\u201d he said on the phone. \u201cThe future is unclear. It will be difficult to live here.\u201d"

    "content": [
      "NEW ORLEANS \u2014 As hundreds of thousands of people in Louisiana faced the prospect of punishingly hot weeks ahead without electricity, officials urged those who had fled before the onslaught of Hurricane Ida to stay away indefinitely as the long slog of recovery began.",
      "While search-and-rescue efforts wound down in the bayous and small towns of southern Louisiana, the ugly reality of the storm\u2019s aftermath, even in places like New Orleans that were spared the worst, was becoming miserably clear.",
      "\u201cMany of the life-supporting infrastructure elements are not present, they\u2019re not operating right now,\u201d Gov. John Bel Edwards said at a news conference in the flood-wrecked city of LaPlace on Tuesday. \u201cIf you have already evacuated, do not return.\u201d",
      "In New Orleans, which has been without power since Sunday night, the situation has grown so dire for those who remained that city officials have considered extensive post-storm evacuations. But for now, given that the current crisis is not one of ruined homes, as it was in the chaotic days after Hurricane Katrina, city officials are focused on getting food, water and ice to residents desperately in need of them.",
      "\u201cWe know it\u2019s hot, we know we don\u2019t have any power,\u201d Mayor LaToya Cantrell said during a news conference, adding that the power company, Entergy, had yet to give a timeline for restoring electricity to the city. Food and water distribution points were being set up in parks and churches, and city buses were serving as \u201cmobile cooling centers.\u201d",
      "Still, officials emphasized that they had not fully eliminated the possibility of large-scale evacuations for the 200,000 people they estimate remain in the city.",
      "\u201cWe have to look at every contingency,\u201d said Collin Arnold, director of the city\u2019s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness.",
      "While New Orleans residents sweltered in a thick, soupy air that felt hotter than 100 degrees, things were even worse in other parts of southern Louisiana, where damage from the wind and water on Sunday was catastrophic. About 700,000 people were without water on Tuesday, including hundreds of thousands in Jefferson Parish, where buses were picking up people who did not have access to transportation and taking them to shelters elsewhere in the state.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re getting calls all day,\u201d said Byron Lee, a Jefferson Parish councilman.",
      "Tens of thousands of other people in the state were under boil-water advisories. Eleven hospitals have been evacuated as the state endures one of its worst Covid-19 outbreaks of the pandemic. Some facilities were damaged in the storm; at least one reported a malfunctioning backup generator.",
      "\u201cOur hospitals are full,\u201d the governor said at the news briefing. \u201cAnd we know that even if you have a generator, typically, after so many days, they start to fail. And so we\u2019re doing everything we can to work with them to get them to restore electricity as soon as possible.\u201d",
      "Leaving behind a trail of destruction in Louisiana, the remnants of Ida continued to move northeast on Tuesday, bringing heavy rains, and the risks of flash flooding, to Alabama, Tennessee and eventually the Mid-Atlantic. Back in the state where it had come ashore, more than a million customers were without power, including everyone in New Orleans.",
      "A spokesman for Entergy, the largest electric utility in New Orleans, said in an email on Tuesday that it expected \u201cto have first light within the city by end of day Wednesday\u201d but did not provide specifics. Still, city officials said that, given the extent of the damage, it would take some time to get electricity to people\u2019s homes even after power started to return.",
      "In a sweaty, miserable city on Tuesday, this was all just talk.",
      "\u201cI could barely breathe last night,\u201d said Eddie Garner, 32, who found himself behind a hundred people hoping to buy generators when he arrived at Lowe\u2019s shortly before 9 a.m. His mother and brother are both hospitalized with Covid-19 \u2014 his mother on a ventilator, he said \u2014 and he has not been able to reach the nursing station by phone. The heat has left him dizzy, exhausted and despondent.",
      "\u201cWe may have made it through the storm, but this is just too much,\u201d Mr. Garner said, his voice quavering. \u201cWe can\u2019t make it much longer like this.\u201d",
      "Because of $14.5 billion in flood protection infrastructure, New Orleans was spared the worst of Hurricane Ida. The levees held firm, the surge gates kept the lake out and the hurricane, while feinting toward the city at the last minute, did not deliver the punishing blows that residents have learned to fear.",
      "But avoiding the worst of a disaster does not mean avoiding disaster. With the power out all across the city, schools are closed indefinitely and hospitals are working on generator power. City officials are discussing the possibility of using the convention center as a shelter for people from around the region with specialized medical needs.",
      "On Tuesday morning, students at Tulane University were put on buses for Houston, told to return in person in October; at Covenant House, a homeless shelter across town, 60 people, including three very young children with their mothers and two pregnant women, were headed to Houston as well.",
      "New Orleans residents who were already in Houston hotel rooms, having assumed they would spend a day or two away, sat calculating how long they could possibly afford to stay there. Those who had not left and had nowhere to go now were considering how they would fare during some of the most punishingly hot days of the summer.",
      "On Tuesday evening, the mayor announced an 8 p.m. curfew, standing next to the New Orleans police chief, Shaun Ferguson, who warned that a city without streetlights after dark was \u201ctotally unsafe.\u201d",
      "In New Orleans East \u2014 one of the neighborhoods that saw the worst flooding after Katrina in 2005 \u2014 the poor and working-class residents of an apartment complex called the Willows were overwhelmed by the heat on Tuesday. None had electricity, and many did not have cash or gas or working cars or cellphones that still had a charge.",
      "Dianne Delpit, 40, who had been living with her extended family in a unit where the roof failed and water soaked their belongings, was hoping relatives might come get them from Baton Rouge. But it was difficult to reach anybody, and no one had come to check on her and her family.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like we just have to survive on our own,\u201d Ms. Delpit said. \u201cIt feels like Katrina.\u201d",
      "Natalie Jayroe, the president and chief executive of the Second Harvest Food Bank, said food banks in southern Louisiana were usually prepared for the short-term fallout of hurricanes and other disasters. But because of how quickly Ida barreled through and how long its effects are expected to last, she said, there was an \u201cincreasing nervousness\u201d about food and clean water shortages.",
      "Louisiana typically has about 750,000 people in need of food assistance. During the pandemic that number rose to about 930,000. \u201cLayer on top of that, all those people that are normally food secure but have no power and no ability to shop and buy groceries and you\u2019re talking a million-plus people in the state that need help,\u201d Ms. Jayroe said.",
      "All over New Orleans, people seemed to be waiting in line \u2014 for generators, for gas, for meals, for bags of ice, for some sort of deliverance from the misery. On the corner of Josephine Street, dozens of Spanish-speaking men were waiting under a relentless sun for the possibility of a storm cleanup job. But no vans or trucks came by.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what we are going to do,\u201d said Gerardo Caal, a 41-year-old Guatemalan man in a baseball cap. \u201cThere\u2019s no food. And we don\u2019t have electricity to cook.\u201d",
      "A few feet away, traffic heading Uptown was impeded by a line of cars blocks long that led to one of the few open gas stations in the area. Malcolm Scott, 60, a former star tight end at Louisiana State University, said he had been waiting for hours to get gas. He was not trying to get out of town, he said, but to move to his girlfriend\u2019s place on the third floor of an apartment building, out of a hard-earned fear that the city\u2019s levees might still give way.",
      "\u201cAin\u2019t nowhere to go,\u201d he said of leaving town. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want New Orleans people no more since Katrina. They think we\u2019re the worst of the worst.\u201d",
      "A block away, the front door of a Family Dollar store had been smashed, with bottles of hair-care products and packages of food strewn about amid the broken glass. Two employees were stepping around the debris, recording it on their phones. \u201cI guess we\u2019re not coming back to work for two months,\u201d one of them, a young woman, said.",
      "A black sedan pulled up with a family inside. The worker said there were not items for sale.",
      "\u201cNo diapers, no nothing?\u201d a voice said from inside the car.",
      "The young worker shrugged.",
      "A man stepped out of the car, looked over his shoulders, and walked through the hole in the door."

    "title": "California\u2019s Plan to Make New Buildings Greener Will Also Raise Costs",
    "content": [
      "California has led the nation in fighting climate change by encouraging the use of renewable energy and electric cars. Now the state is taking on an even harder challenge \u2014 reducing emissions from homes, businesses and other buildings that have to be heated, cooled and powered.",
      "This month, state regulators updated California\u2019s building code to require some new homes and commercial buildings to have solar panels and batteries and the wiring needed to switch from heaters that burn natural gas to heat pumps that run on electricity. Energy experts say it is one of the most sweeping single environmental updates to building codes ever attempted by a government agency.",
      "But some energy and building experts warn that California may be taking on too much, too quickly and focusing on the wrong target \u2014 new buildings, rather than the much larger universe of existing structures. Their biggest fear is that these new requirements will drive up the state\u2019s already high construction costs, putting new homes out of reach of middle- and lower-income families that cannot as easily afford the higher upfront costs of cleaner energy and heating equipment, which typically pays for itself over years through savings on monthly utility bills.",
      "The median single-family home in California sells for more than $800,000 compared to about $360,000 nationwide, and businesses pay more for rent in cities like San Francisco and San Jose than anywhere else in the country. A big reason costs are higher in California is that the state is not building enough homes, something lawmakers tried to address last week by advancing legislation that would allow more than one home on each parcel of land.",
      "Adding solar panels and a battery to a new home can raise its cost by $20,000 or more. While that might not matter to somebody buying a million-dollar property, it could be a burden on a family borrowing a few hundred thousand dollars to buy a home.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re going to see the impact in office rents. You\u2019re going to see it in the cost of the milk in your grocery store,\u201d said Donald J. Ruthroff, a principal at Dahlin Group Architecture Planning in Pleasanton, Calif. \u201cThere\u2019s no question this is going to impact prices across the board.\u201d",
      "The idea at the heart of California\u2019s new building code, which is expected to go into effect in 2023, is to reduce and eventually eliminate the use of fossil fuels like natural gas, replacing them with electricity generated by renewable sources like solar panels, wind turbines and hydroelectric dams. It is difficult to make that switch because millions of homes and commercial buildings need to be updated. That\u2019s why California is starting with the easiest buildings to change \u2014 ones that haven\u2019t been built yet.",
      "Regulators in California acknowledge their building code changes could raise construction costs but argue that the modifications will save money over time. Officials argue that the changes are essential to reducing planet-warming emissions that pose their own costs. Destruction from wildfires, heat waves and other extreme weather linked to climate change collectively add up to billions of dollars in expenses like firefighting, rebuilding homes and higher electricity bills.",
      "\u201cThe urgency of climate change has gone up,\u201d said Andrew McAllister, a member of the California Energy Commission, which developed and approved the building code changes. \u201cWe know we\u2019ve got to get on the stick and do something.\u201d",
      "President Biden has also made fighting climate change a priority. The administration this month said the United States needs to triple or quadruple the annual pace at which it is adding solar energy in order to eliminate emissions from the electricity sector by 2035. That would increase solar generation from about 3 percent of the power sector to 40 percent.",
      "California is already far along in that transition with more than a third of its electricity coming from renewable sources. Its building code change is meant to accelerate that.",
      "California and Washington State develop their own energy standards for building codes. The other 48 and the District of Columbia largely use models developed by a division of the International Code Council, a nonprofit organization run by building officials from across the country. Some states leave buildings code decisions to local governments. The code council sometimes adopts energy-related standards developed by California, a representative of the group said.",
      "Michael Marini, who co-owns a company that builds homes in Southern California, said he generally supports making buildings greener but he fears that the state is not thinking through the consequences of the changes it is pushing through.",
      "Mr. Marini\u2019s company, Planet Home Living, is adding rooftop solar panels in his latest projects, including townhouse-style and single-family homes in Los Angeles, as required by a previous change to the state\u2019s building code that took effect last year. Those homes start at close to $1 million and go as high as $2 million. Buyers of those properties will not flinch at having to pay an extra $10,000 to $15,000 for solar panels, he said. Mr. Marini is also not worried about the new code change that will require him to add home batteries in some multifamily buildings at a cost of about $5,000 each starting in 2023.",
      "But in other locations like San Bernardino, a far less affluent city east of Los Angeles, where the typical home sells for about $529,000, the cost of solar panels and batteries can be a bigger burden to home buyers.",
      "\u201cIf we push it and we do things that are modern and efficient and green, we tend to be able to do it in Los Angeles,\u201d Mr. Marini said. \u201cThat\u2019s not entirely true in the rest of the country. We can\u2019t do that in San Bernardino. At the end, the consumer absorbs the cost.\u201d",
      "The Sycamore Square townhouses were the last ones developed in San Bernardino before the solar mandate took effect last year. Glenn Elssmann, a partner in the project who hired Mr. Marini\u2019s company as the contractor, said the added cost of the solar requirement would have made construction of the development impossible. Homes in Sycamore Square started at $340,000 for the four-bedroom, three-bath units and reached as high as $370,000.",
      "Jimmie Joyce, 44, who works in payroll at the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, will soon close on the purchase of a house in Sycamore Square after trying for almost a year to buy closer to Inglewood, a city near the Los Angeles International Airport where he lives now. His commute will likely increase from about 40 minutes to an hour and a half.",
      "\u201cI, for one, didn\u2019t even plan on moving out that far,\u201d Mr. Joyce said. \u201cThe way the market is, people are just overbidding to just try to get in things.\u201d He said he made an offer $10,000 to $15,000 higher than the asking price on a home that ended up with more than 70 bids, including one that was $60,000 more than his.",
      "His new home is already expensive for him, he said, and adding $10,000 to $20,000 more for solar, a battery and other amenities \u201cwould make that much more challenging.\u201d",
      "The changes regulators adopted this month will also require most new commercial buildings, including schools, hotels, hospitals, office buildings, retailers and grocery stores, and apartment buildings and condos above three stories to include solar and batteries. And regulators will require single-family homes to have wiring that will allow them to use electric heat pumps and water heaters, rather than ones that burn natural gas. About 55 percent of California\u2019s homes use electric heat and 45 percent use natural gas.",
      "Chris Ochoa, senior counsel for codes and regulatory and legislative affairs at the California Building Industry Association, said the builders support efforts to address climate change. But he believes more needs to be done to retrofit existing buildings with more energy-efficient systems, too. Otherwise, new homes, with more efficient and advanced systems, will become even less affordable to first-time buyers.",
      "There are 14 million existing homes, a number that dwarfs the roughly 100,000 permits that builders seek annually for new homes in the state, Mr. Ochoa added.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve really got to focus on the existing housing stock,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re getting the biggest bang for your buck.\u201d",
      "Mr. Ruthroff, the architect, said the state\u2019s approach to focus on new homes made sense because it is \u201cthe low-hanging fruit.\u201d But he added that there was only so much to be gained from imposing such requirements on new buildings since they are already much better insulated and have more advanced appliances and heating and cooling equipment than older homes.",
      "Mr. McAllister, the energy commission member, said he appreciates the need to upgrade existing buildings. But tackling that problem will take many years and a lot of money. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take tens of billions of dollars to get into our existing homes,\u201d he said.",
      "For now, the commission is focused on requiring the most cost-effective changes. For example, its recent code change was based on analysis that determined that it made economic sense to require solar panels and batteries for new homes and most commercial buildings, but not for much larger warehouses and factories. The new code changes will also go down easier, Mr. McAllister claimed because many homeowners and businesses are already buying solar panels and batteries.",
      "\u201cSolar is cheap,\u201d Mr. McAllister said. And \u201cit\u2019s an amenity that the marketplace actually wants.\u201d"

      "A fast-moving wildfire in the parched woodlands of northeastern Minnesota continued to threaten cabins, homes and recreational sites on Friday as hundreds of firefighters fought to contain it.",
      "The Greenwood fire, in the Superior National Forest not far from the Canadian border, has burned more than 25,000 acres since it began on Aug. 15, according to the U.S. Forest Service. The fire, which has not been contained, was started by lightning, the authorities said.",
      "Evacuation orders are in effect for several areas, including McDougal Lake, Sand Lake, and areas along Highway 2 and north of Highway 1. The fire destroyed 12 primary structures, which include homes and cabins, and 57 outbuildings, which include garages or outhouses, earlier this week, the Lake County Sheriff\u2019s office said. Crews used heavy machinery on Wednesday to build a fire line along the part of the fire to the west of Highway 2.",
      "\u201cOur hearts go out to any of you who lost your cabin or your home,\u2019\u2019 Connie Cummins, a forest supervisor, said at a news conference on Thursday.",
      "She added that \u201cthere has been some really good progress made on the fire. We\u2019re just looking very closely at prioritizing those lines that will provide the most protection.\u201d",
      "More than 475 people, including firefighters, logging groups and contractors, were battling the blaze, Brian Pisarek, an incident commander, said at the news conference.",
      "The Greenwood fire and others in the region are causing air-quality problems across a wide area, according to the National Weather Service. An air quality alert was in effect through Friday evening.",
      "\u201cSome members of the general public may experience health effects,\u201d the Weather Service said on Friday, adding that children, older adults and people with respiratory or cardiac issues should avoid all strenuous outdoor activities in the affected area.",
      "Fires just across the border, in Quetico Provincial Park in Canada, also continue to burn with no containment and will contribute to smoky conditions.",
      "The rain showers and thunderstorms that were expected to move into the region Friday will continue on and off throughout the weekend, the Weather Service said.",
      "There was also a flash flood watch in effect for Friday. Flash flooding of creeks, streams, urban areas, and low lying areas was possible.",
      "Though Minnesota is dotted with lakes, severe to exceptional drought conditions related to climate change have ravaged much of the state this summer, as they have in areas across the Northern Plains and Western United States, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Drought restrictions were imposed in parts of Minnesota last week, limiting or banning activities like lawn watering."

      "AUSTIN, Texas \u2014 It was early morning in the lobby of the Line Hotel, and everyone was eating migas.",
      "The migas, from a restaurant called Veracruz All Natural, have long been a fixation for the breakfast-taco-obsessed populace of Austin: scrambled eggs flecked with pico de gallo and freshly made tortilla chips that hang onto their crunch, then topped messily with Monterey Jack cheese, cilantro and a sliver of avocado. The whole thing is nestled into a tortilla and wrapped tightly in foil like a present.",
      "\u201cWhen I go out of town, that is the meal I have before I leave, and when I come back into town, that is the meal I have,\u201d said Nadia Chaudhury, the editor of Eater Austin. \u201cTheirs is by far the best example of Austin\u2019s tacos.\u201d",
      "But if the migas, sold in the hotel and five other locations, are attention-grabbers, their creators are quite the opposite. Reyna and Maritza Vazquez, the owners of Veracruz All Natural, are shy and laid back, often clad in jeans and sneakers.",
      "The Vazquez sisters have done more than serve popular tacos from a food truck. They\u2019ve changed the landscape of Austin dining, paving the way for more regional Mexican offerings in a city long defined by Tex Mex cooking, and helping other immigrants, and their families, to build restaurant groups with minimal capital.",
      "\u201cThere wouldn\u2019t be so many new and different styles coming in if it wasn\u2019t for them,\u201d said Armando Rayo, a journalist and producer at Identity Productions in Austin who writes about tacos. \u201cThey did a lot for the immigrant entrepreneur.\u201d",
      "They\u2019ve accomplished this by making the dishes they grew up with in Veracruz, Mexico, and not bowing to the pressure that many immigrant chefs feel to change their food to fit in. If anything, Mr. Rayo added, the sisters are setting the trends in Austin. Certainly there were food trucks, breakfast tacos and freshly pressed juices in the city before the Vazquezes came along, but Veracruz All Natural feels prescient for combining so many of the elements that would come to be Austin signatures.",
      "In September, after requests from customers around the country, the Vazquezes will start a food truck in Los Angeles, expanding the business beyond Texas. \u201cIf we can go and be successful there, we\u2019ll try elsewhere,\u201d said Reyna Vazquez, 38.",
      "While the sisters are proud of their success at home, they do sometimes feel conflicted about how it has played out. They\u2019ve built a customer base that is overwhelmingly non-Hispanic \u2014 without a broad following within their own robust community. East Austin, where they started Veracruz, has significantly gentrified, and many of its longtime Mexican American residents have moved elsewhere.",
      "The sisters don\u2019t feel as if they fit into the primarily male chef circles in Austin, either. Customers often assume, they say, that the restaurants are run by their husbands, who are white. \u201cIt is interesting how people think automatically that a successful business, it has to be a white-owned business,\u201d Reyna said.",
      "\u201cWe are trying to change that,\u201d she added, and not by following some template for success laid out by other restaurants. They are creating their own.",
      "Their arrival in Los Angeles will be characteristically low-key. They\u2019re going with what they know: a truck parked at the Line Hotel in Koreatown. An eventual brick-and-mortar restaurant is also part of the plan.",
      "The truck, called Hot Tacos, will have a less regional menu than their Austin locales: taco bowls, tacos (including migas), quesadillas and nachos. The idea, the sisters say, is to serve high-quality Mexican food at a reasonable price \u2014 $11 for a steak taco bowl, for example \u2014 occupying a middle ground between the fancy places and the street carts.",
      "They say they have received lucrative offers to open in several states, including Colorado, Washington and New York. But Los Angeles has always been their dream. The city\u2019s thriving, diverse taqueria scene might be daunting for some newcomers. For the sisters, it\u2019s exciting, Maritza Vazquez, 42, said in Spanish. (The sisters are bilingual.) \u201cWe want to show that we can succeed in a city that has a lot of variety.\u201d",
      "The Los Angeles move comes 22 years after they came to the United States, crossing the border illegally with their mother, Reyna Senior, and Maritza\u2019s ex-husband and her stepdaughter, Lis-ek Mariscal.",
      "While working at an Austin taqueria, the sisters noticed that the Mexican dishes bore little resemblance to what their mother served at the restaurant she ran out of their home back in Veracruz. Tex Mex, with its rich chili con carne and queso, was by far the city\u2019s predominant take on Mexican food.",
      "In 2006, with $6,000, Reyna bought a truck and opened Antojitos Veracruz on North Lamar Boulevard, offering the city a taste of her home, with juices, smoothies and snacks like elote and raspados. Two years later, Maritza joined, and they began serving tacos based on their mother\u2019s recipes on East Cesar Chavez Street.",
      "\u201cPeople weren\u2019t used to buying from a food truck\u201d at first, Reyna said, though the city would become a center of the national food-truck boom just a few years later. Neither sister spoke English at the time, and they feared that people would discover their undocumented status. (Both are in the process of applying for citizenship.)",
      "Business picked up after Veracruz attracted coverage in the local papers \u2014 a 2009 article in the Austin Chronicle spotlighting their pork torta, and a short feature in the Austin American-Statesman in 2011.",
      "There were Mexican restaurants all over East Austin, said Mr. Rayo, the journalist and producer. But Veracruz All Natural stood out for its emphasis on fresh produce and vegetarian dishes. The truck was easily accessible because of its proximity to Interstate 35, a major highway widely regarded as an unofficial barrier between Austin\u2019s white and nonwhite populations.",
      "Though Veracruz drew many diners to East Austin for the first time, some who lived there thought the tacos were too expensive, and not the Tex Mex they were used to.",
      "\u201cI guess the product we were selling didn\u2019t really aim toward the community we were in,\u201d said Ms. Mariscal, who is now Veracruz\u2019s training manager. \u201cThey were like, \u2018What is this healthy stuff?\u2019\u201d",
      "In 2012, the sisters were invited to set up a food trailer on East Sixth Street for the South by Southwest festival. Emeril Lagasse, Rachael Ray and other celebrities stopped by and ordered. In 2015, Veracruz All Natural was highlighted on the Food Network show \u201cTop 5 Restaurants.\u201d Their blue trailer with the straw umbrellas had become a destination.",
      "Today, diners can find Veracruz across Austin. All but three of its 60 or so employees are Hispanic, the sisters said. But they are still trying to build a stronger connection to their own community.",
      "Because Veracruz has drawn so much notice in English-speaking publications and attracted such a large non-Hispanic audience, Reyna said, Hispanic people can feel too intimidated to visit. They make up only about one-fifth of the customers.",
      "To make Veracruz feel more welcoming, last spring the sisters began hosting salsa nights featuring musicians from the Latin diaspora, and Frida Friday ATX, a monthly market, named for the Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, that spotlights local purveyors of color. \u201cI miss talking to people in Spanish,\u201d Reyna said.",
      "Regina Estrada, whose family opened the Tex Mex restaurant Joe\u2019s Bakery in East Austin in 1962, said her place has been around long enough that Mexican American customers who moved out of the area will make a special trip to eat there. Veracruz, she said, may not have cultivated those regulars because it is newer.",
      "Ms. Estrada, 40, used to live near the restaurant\u2019s first location. \u201cTo kind of watch them grow and see the recognition and the accolades they received is really just a testament to the work ethic\u201d of the Vazquez sisters, she said. At the same time, she added, one place could never be representative of Austin\u2019s wide variety of taquerias. \u201cBut I think it is so much easier to say it is. It is a nicer story to spin.\u201d",
      "Still, Luis Robledo, 31, who grew up in East Austin, says Veracruz has had a positive impact on Austin dining and restaurants like his own. Mr. Robledo, who goes by Beto, was raised on Tex Mex, but his restaurant, Cuantos Tacos, which opened in 2019, focuses on the cooking of Mexico City. \u201cWithout people knowing it,\u201d he said, Veracruz \u201copened up their minds to new ways of eating tacos.\u201d",
      "His is one of several taquerias, run by people of color and focused on various regional styles, that have recently opened on the East Side, including Nixta Taqueria and Discada. He said the Vazquez sisters had freely offered business advice to him and other owners.",
      "That\u2019s the kind of help the sisters say they haven\u2019t received from chefs who run other popular restaurants in the city. \u201cThey don\u2019t invite us to their events, or to do collaborations,\u201d Reyna said.",
      "Ms. Chaudhury, of Eater Austin, called Veracruz\u2019s exclusion from major Austin food festivals \u201can unintentional form of gatekeeping,\u201d as the people who organize these events tend to be white men who ask others like them to participate.",
      "This doesn\u2019t bother the sisters, who haven\u2019t sought out the conventional trappings of success for a chef, like a television hosting gig or a cookbook. Three years ago, they were asked to make tacos on the Food Network show \u201cBeat Bobby Flay,\u201d but declined because Reyna had planned a vacation. (Their business director initially said they were too busy to be interviewed for this article.)",
      "They\u2019re not done expanding in Austin. On a recent Wednesday, the sisters gathered at what will become their second brick-and-mortar location in Austin, scheduled to open early next year. This space, at the former Robert Mueller Municipal Airport, used to be a Youngblood\u2019s Fried Chicken, part of an old-school Texas chain. Black-and-white photos of young couples filled the walls, along with a big sign over the pass that said, \u201cSave room for pie!\u201d",
      "The sisters will replace those decorations with vibrant murals inspired by Mexican street art and the Veracruz coastline. Their menu will have tamales veracruzanos and cochinita pibil. Quietly and unapologetically, they\u2019ll make the place their own.",

    "content": [
      "As Susan Dominus, a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine, approached her reporting for an article on the attacks on Dominion Voting Systems, a business that supplies election technology, she wanted to tell the story of one of the Dominion employees who was being vilified by supporters of President Trump.",
      "She zeroed in on one man: Eric Coomer, whose anti-Trump social media posts were used to bolster false allegations that Dominion had tampered with the election, leading to death threats. Her article, published on Tuesday, is a case study in what can happen when information gets wildly manipulated. In an edited interview, Ms. Dominus discussed what she learned.",
      "How did you come upon Eric Coomer \u2014 did you have him in mind all along? Or did you want to do something on Dominion and eventually found your way to him?",
      "The Magazine was interested in pursuing a story about how the attacks on Dominion Voting Systems \u2014 a private business \u2014 were dramatically influencing the lives of those who worked there, people who were far from public figures. Many employees there were having their private information exposed, but early on, a lot of the threats were focusing on Eric Coomer, who was then the director of product strategy and security at Dominion. Eventually, people such as the lawyers Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani and the president\u2019s son Eric Trump were naming him in the context of accusations about Dominion fixing the election.",
      "What was the biggest surprise you came across in your reporting?",
      "I was genuinely surprised to find that Mr. Coomer had expressed strong anti-Trump sentiments, using strong language, on his Facebook page. His settings were such that only his Facebook friends could see it, but someone took a screenshot of those and other divisive posts, and right-wing media circulated them widely. The posts were used in the spread of what cybersecurity experts call malinformation \u2014 something true that is used to support the dissemination of a story that is false. In this case, it was the big lie that the election was rigged. I think to understand the spread of spurious information \u2014 to resist its lure, to fight it off \u2014 these distinctions are helpful to parse. Understanding the human cost of these campaigns also matters. We heard a lot about the attacks on Dominion, but there are real people with real lives who are being battered in a battle they had no intention of joining, whatever their private opinions.",
      "There were so many elaborate theories of election fraud involving Dominion. How important were the accusations against Eric Coomer in that bigger story?",
      "It\u2019s hard to say. But Advance Democracy Inc., a nonpartisan nonprofit, looked at the tweets in its database from QAnon-related accounts and found that, from Nov. 1 to Jan. 7, Eric Coomer\u2019s name appeared in 25 percent of the ones that mentioned Dominion. Coomer believes the attacks on Dominion were somewhat inevitable but considered his own role as \u201can accelerant.\u201d",
      "Why did so much attention focus on Dominion Voting Systems, as opposed to its competitors?",
      "I\u2019m not sure anyone fully understands that right now. But they happened to be heavily represented in swing states that went for Mr. Biden, such as Arizona, Michigan and Georgia. Election experts say that the elections went extraordinarily well, for the most part, especially given that there were record numbers of mail-in ballots due to Covid. But there were two instances, in places that used Dominion voting machines, where election officials made small mistakes (and skipped the necessary steps that would have caught those errors). Those, too, became fuel for subsequent malinformation campaigns. And then the Coomer story was amplified, too.",
      "So is this story a cautionary tale about social media?",
      "I think many people have taken it that way. But to me, it\u2019s a case study in how one data point, which proved nothing, was taken, manipulated and transmitted with great speed, along various channels of right-wing media, until it reached the lawyers of the president of the United States, who were desperate for anything to delegitimize Joe Biden\u2019s winning the election.",
      "It\u2019s also about a culture of implicit violence, which was seething in the background during those weeks leading up to Jan. 6. The threats against Mr. Coomer were serious enough that a private security firm his employer hired told him they did not think it was safe for him to go home. He is one of so many election officials or experts who have been subject to threats; many are leaving the field as a result."

    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 When Prime Minister Naftali Bennett of Israel was scheduled to meet President Biden at the White House on Thursday, the two new leaders had aimed to reset relations between their countries and reinforce a bond that has showed signs of strain.",
      "But their first meeting was postponed Thursday after two deadly blasts outside the airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, where officials said there were dozens injured or dead, including at least 12 U.S. service members who were killed.",
      "The meeting, originally scheduled for Thursday morning, was delayed and then rescheduled for Friday as Mr. Biden remained in the Situation Room meeting all morning with his top national security advisers and the Pentagon held a briefing with Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., commander of U.S. Central Command.",
      "\u201cOn behalf of the people of Israel, I share our deep sadness over the loss of American lives in Kabul,\u201d Mr. Bennett said in a statement Thursday. \u201cIsrael stands with the United States in these difficult times, just as America has always stood with us. Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of the United States.\u201d",
      "The schedule change means that Mr. Bennett, an Orthodox Jew who does not travel on the Sabbath for religious reasons, will extend his trip to Washington until after the Sabbath on Saturday night.",
      "Mr. Bennett, who arrived in Washington Tuesday night, earlier in the week met with Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III and Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser.",
      "Mr. Biden, who called Mr. Bennett to congratulate him less than two hours after his swearing-in two months ago, has tried to send a clear signal that the United States supports his new, diverse, coalition government.",
      "Mr. Bennett has said that he wants his administration to be known as the \u201cgood-will government,\u201d and that he wants to take a softer tone toward the United States than did his longtime predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu, who often clashed with Democratic leaders.",
      "But for all the conciliatory style, the challenge may be the substance. Mr. Biden and Mr. Bennett, who have never met before, have vastly different views of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and of efforts to restore the Iran nuclear deal.",
      "Mr. Bennett has made clear that there will not be an independent Palestinian state while he is the head of his government. The Biden administration, in contrast, has expressed a deep commitment to a two-state solution that, by definition, includes an independent Palestinian state.",
      "Mr. Bennett also opposes the United States\u2019 re-entry into the Iran agreement, which the Biden administration is exploring.",
      "\u201cThese are two very central issues in the U.S.-Israel relationship on which there are radically different points of view,\u201d said Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of J Street, a liberal pro-Israel advocacy group. \u201cThe tone and the atmosphere cannot substitute for the fact that there is a fundamental difference in view on the core issues at stake in the U.S.-Israel relationship.\u201d",
      "In a recent interview with The New York Times, Mr. Bennett said he would expand West Bank settlements, a move Mr. Biden opposes. And he declined to back American plans to reopen a consulate for Palestinians in Jerusalem.",
      "Still, he made clear that he wanted the meeting to show that the relationship with the United States was on more solid ground, even if some of his policies are similar to those of Mr. Netanyahu.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a new dimension here \u2014 coming up with new ways to address problems, being very realistic, very pragmatic, and being reasonable with friends,\u201d Mr. Bennett said.",
      "His visit comes as Mr. Biden is navigating the biggest foreign policy crisis of his young presidency, trying to evacuate all Americans and Afghan allies from Afghanistan before his Aug. 31 deadline for a withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country after 20 years of war.",
      "At home, Mr. Biden is dealing with crosscurrents over Israel in his own party, as an energized progressive wing and a quiet shift among more mainstream Democrats have led many lawmakers to take a more skeptical approach toward the longtime ally.",
      "Mr. Bennett is also the rare international leader that Mr. Biden, a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, shares no history with, a distinction that sets Mr. Bennett apart even from some of his neighbors. Last month, when King Abdullah II of Jordan became the first Arab head of state to visit the White House since Mr. Biden took office, the president called him a \u201cloyal and decent friend\u201d and noted, \u201cWe\u2019ve been hanging out together for a long time.\u201d"

    "title": "Afghanistan Collapse and Strikes in Somalia Raise Snags for Drone Warfare Rules",
    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Biden administration has nearly completed a policy to govern counterterrorism drone strikes and commando raids outside conventional war zones, but the abrupt collapse of the Afghan government and a recent flurry of strikes in Somalia have raised new problems, according to current and former officials.",
      "The administration has hoped to finish its playbook by the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. It was envisioned as part of a broader recalibration as President Biden seeks to wind down the \u201cforever war\u201d on terrorism and reorient national security policy to how the world has changed since 2001.",
      "But his team\u2019s ability to meet that deadline is now in doubt amid rapidly changing events and uncertainties about the future. Many of the same officials who would develop and approve an updated drone plan for Afghanistan are focused on the emergency evacuation operations in Kabul, the capital, officials said.",
      "In January, Mr. Biden had set out to establish his own overarching policy for drone strikes targeting terrorist threats emanating from countries where the United States does not have troops on the ground. His new administration viewed with suspicion how President Donald J. Trump in 2017 had loosened an earlier version of such rules that President Barack Obama imposed in 2013.",
      "The Biden team has spent more than seven months reviewing those two policies \u2014 including resulting civilian casualty rates \u2014 and assessing the evolution of the global terrorist threat. Their deliberations came to focus on adopting a hybrid approach that would draw elements from both the Obama and Trump systems, officials said.",
      "As now conceived, the Biden-era playbook would return to centralized interagency vetting of proposed strikes \u2014 a hallmark of the Obama approach \u2014 in nations where such operations are rare, they said. But for places where strikes are likely to be more routine, like Somalia and Afghanistan, it would keep part of the Trump approach: issuing \u201ccountry plans\u201d that establish policy goals and targeting standards, then giving commanders in the field greater latitude to decide on their own to carry out particular strikes.",
      "Still, the country plans would be more restrictive than the Trump versions, the officials said. For example, safeguards against civilian bystander deaths under Mr. Trump often gave adult men less protection than women and children, but the prospective Biden plans would make the safeguards equivalent. The Biden rules are also set to require the military to obtain consent for strikes by the State Department\u2019s chiefs of mission, they said.",
      "But the recent upheaval in Afghanistan has rendered the plan the Biden team had originally envisioned for that nation obsolete. Administration officials now need to develop a new playbook to govern any future strikes there before Mr. Biden can put the overall policy into effect, the officials said.",
      "The future of strikes in Afghanistan is particularly important because Mr. Biden and his team have defended his decision to withdraw American ground forces by promising to maintain a robust ability to strike at any new or resurgent terrorist threats emanating from there.",
      "\u201cWe conduct effective counterterrorism missions against terrorist groups in multiple countries where we don\u2019t have permanent military presence,\u201d Mr. Biden said this month. \u201cIf necessary, we\u2019ll do the same in Afghanistan. We\u2019ve developed counterterrorism over-the-horizon capability that will allow us to keep our eyes firmly fixed on the direct threats to the United States in the region, and act quickly and decisively if needed.\u201d",
      "Their original plan for Afghanistan, however, was premised on a scenario in which the United States would conduct airstrikes with the consent of President Ashraf Ghani, supporting his government\u2019s efforts to resist any transnational terrorist groups, like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, that sought to use the country as a base of operations. The Taliban, while separately vying for control of the country, would be neutral in that category of conflict, at least on the surface.",
      "But instead, Mr. Ghani fled, the Afghan army abruptly abdicated and the Taliban swept into power as the de facto government. As a result, a playbook for any future counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan now needs to be redeveloped against the awkward backdrop of uncertainty about the Taliban\u2019s intentions, including whether they will return to hosting terrorist camps as they did in the 1990s, the officials said.",
      "The current and former officials briefed on the deliberations over the drone strike policy spoke about the delicate internal discussions only on the condition of anonymity. Asked for comment, the National Security Council\u2019s press office re-sent The New York Times a statement it had provided in March for an article about the legal policy review, which was then in an early stage.",
      "The Biden plans make sense both to raise standards for protecting civilians but also to maintain greater flexibility for different settings across the world, said Luke Hartig, who worked on drone strike policy for the Obama administration as a senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council.",
      "But, he added: \u201cAfghanistan is going to have to be very fluid. I would hate to have to write guidance for Afghanistan right now.\u201d",
      "The Biden team has decided to call its playbook for strikes on terrorist targets outside active war zones the P.P.M., or presidential policy memorandum, the officials said. That fits with a tradition of bland bureaucratic abbreviations for the high-stakes rules: Mr. Obama\u2019s 2013 version was called the \u201cP.P.G.,\u201d for presidential policy guidance, and Mr. Trump\u2019s 2017 version was called the \u201cP.S.P.,\u201d for principles, standards and procedures.",
      "But creating any bureaucratic system and planning for drone strikes cut against Mr. Biden\u2019s repeated statements that he wants to end the forever war, said Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law School professor who frequently writes about national security legal policy.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t blame them because I think real threats persist,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s better to have a system for dealing with them than just letting the Pentagon do whatever it wants. But creating a system for drone strikes doesn\u2019t sound like the path to winding down the forever war.\u201d",
      "The need for a new Afghanistan playbook has added to another unresolved problem that arose late in the deliberations over the Biden-era policy: uncertainty over how much latitude the military should have to carry out strikes in defense of partner forces, without going through the usual vetting.",
      "That issue came into focus after the military\u2019s Africa Command carried out three drone strikes targeting the Qaeda-linked militant group Al Shabab in Somalia in late July and early August, breaking a lull in which it had not launched any airstrikes there for six months.",
      "The hiatus had followed a policy directive issued by the president\u2019s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, just after Mr. Biden\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 20. Under the temporary rule, any drone strikes away from battlefield zones needed White House approval while the new administration drafted its policy.",
      "But the directive contained an exception for strikes in self-defense. And when the military resumed attacks against Al Shabab, it invoked that exception rather than seek advance permission from the White House.",
      "The catch was that those at risk were Somali government forces who had gone out to battle Al Shabab, not Americans. Instead, Africa Command deemed the strikes \u201ccollective self-defense\u201d of a partner force. It said this week that it had carried out another such strike in defense of \u201cour Somali partners.\u201d",
      "That the military can routinely sidestep the usual procedures for drone strikes by invoking the need to defend partner forces \u2014 including some who may be threatened by opponents who are not part of the United States\u2019 congressionally authorized war on Al Qaeda and its progeny \u2014 called into question whether the new policy would succeed in imposing tighter control over airstrikes away from conventional battlefields, officials said.",
      "As a result, the administration has started to dig into the issue, including raising the possibility of tightening standards for when commanders may deem a foreign entity a partner and winnowing the list of such groups. (The comprehensive list is classified, officials said.)",
      "That issue was not yet resolved, officials said, when the fall of Afghanistan threw the administration\u2019s counterterrorism strike policy into broader turmoil. But in one respect, the evaporation of the Afghan army has simplified matters: In that country, it appears, there are no longer any partner forces to defend."

    "title": "Texas House Passes Voting Bill as G.O.P. Nears a Hard-Fought Victory",
    "content": [
      "AUSTIN \u2014 The Texas House of Representatives passed a sweeping election overhaul bill on Friday, clearing a major hurdle in a monthslong push by Republicans to introduce a host of new voting rules.",
      "The passage of the bill came a week after a handful of Democrats returned to the State Capitol, effectively ending a 38-day walkout that included the flight of much of the party\u2019s State House delegation to Washington and drew national attention to the fight over voting rights in Texas.",
      "It signaled the end stages in the most protracted battle in a nationwide Republican campaign to harden election rules in response to false claims about the integrity of the 2020 presidential contest.",
      "The House\u2019s version of the bill, which passed on a nearly party-line vote of 80 to 41, will be considered by the State Senate \u2014 which may introduce changes that would require the bill to be approved again by the House \u2014 before it can be sent to the desk of Gov. Greg Abbott.",
      "The bill would ban voting changes that were introduced last year by local officials, like drive-through polling places and 24-hour voting; greatly empower partisan poll watchers; limit the mailing of absentee ballot applications; and increase civil and criminal penalties for voter fraud and for election officials who run afoul of the election code.",
      "The legislation has long been a priority of Mr. Abbott, a Republican, who pledged to repeatedly call special sessions until lawmakers sent a voting bill for him to sign.",
      "The bill passed the State Senate this month, but because the House made changes and amendments, the Senate must review it again. Both chambers are controlled by Republicans.",
      "State Senator Bryan Hughes, one of the bill\u2019s sponsors, said that Republicans in his chamber objected to only one amendment, a provision aimed at avoiding criminal prosecutions of formerly incarcerated people for voting \u2014 people like Crystal Mason and Hervis Rogers \u2014 by instructing judges to tell those convicted of felonies that they are ineligible to vote.",
      "Mr. Hughes said the Senate would discuss that amendment in a conference committee, in which the final version of a bill is hashed out behind closed doors. Once the Senate agrees on an altered bill, it will have to be sent back to the House before it can go to Mr. Abbott\u2019s desk.",
      "Previous iterations of the bill had been stymied by House Democrats\u2019 decisions to break quorum in two consecutive sessions, denying Republicans the necessary minimum of lawmakers to conduct business.",
      "During legislative debate on Thursday and Friday, Democrats denounced the proposed new voting restrictions as disproportionately harmful to Black and Latino Texans. Their amendments, aimed at weakening the legislation, mostly failed.",
      "\u201cIf you think that you\u2019re winning today,\u201d State Representative Senfronia Thompson, a long-serving Democrat from Houston, told her Republican colleagues on Friday, \u201cyou will reap what you sow.\u201d",
      "Republicans\u2019 response was, in essence, that it was not their job to entice more people to vote.",
      "During debate on Thursday, State Representative Andrew Murr, a Republican from rural Kerrville, applied Texas Republicans\u2019 mantra of personal responsibility to voting. \u201cI\u2019m not sure the goal of the state is to actively seek out voters,\u201d he said. \u201cThe state is not so proactive that it tries to grab all the voters.\u201d",
      "Several late amendments to the bill addressed the integrity of voting and ballot counting systems, an outgrowth of former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s false claims of widespread fraud in last year\u2019s election. Some passed, like a requirement that large Texas counties provide livestreaming video of ballot-counting areas. Others did not, such as a Republican amendment to conduct a \u201cforensic audit\u201d of the 2020 election in Texas.",
      "One of the last amendments on Thursday was aimed at avoiding criminal prosecutions of formerly incarcerated people for voting \u2014 people like Crystal Mason and Hervis Rogers \u2014 by instructing judges to tell those convicted of felonies that they are ineligible to vote.",
      "In addition to voting on the elections bill on Friday, the House is also considering a number of Republican priorities that have made 2021 among the most conservative legislative sessions in the history of Texas, including increasing funding for building a border wall and a bill on \u201ccensorship\u201d by social media platforms.",
      "The House\u2019s vote on Friday most likely signaled the end of drama that began in late May when, in the closing hours of the Texas Legislature\u2019s regular session, Democratic House members fled the chamber to stop Republicans from passing a similar bill.",
      "An irate Mr. Abbott called a special session to begin in early July, urging legislators to consider a voting bill along with proposals to direct more money toward border security, restrict transgender youths\u2019 participation in interscholastic athletics and limit access to abortion, among other conservative priorities. More than 50 House Democrats, led by their progressive wing, organized two charter flights from Austin to Washington, where they were initially greeted as heroes by congressional Democrats in their shared fight to enact new federal voting protections.",
      "Their momentum was short-lived.",
      "In the days after their arrival, groups of Texas House Democrats met with Vice President Kamala Harris and Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a key vote in the push to pass Democrats\u2019 federal voting bills. But before their first week in the capital had ended, several of the Texas lawmakers tested positive for the coronavirus, turning their planned media tour and congressional pressure campaign into a series of videoconferences that failed to attract much attention.",
      "They remained ensconced at a hotel in downtown Washington, unable to use the swimming pool because Republicans had stationed a videographer on the deck waiting to film any of them appearing to violate their pledge to work tirelessly for voting rights.",
      "In the hours after the July special session ended, Mr. Abbott called a second one to begin two days later. But the potential arrests of Democrats who failed to appear in the statehouse chamber, promised by Mr. Abbott and State House Republican leaders, failed to materialize. By then, the Democrats had quietly returned to the state, with many going about their daily lives without incident.",
      "By the end of last week, a trickle of State House Democrats began returning to the State Capitol, ending the walkout and allowing the business of the chamber to resume. While Texas Democrats celebrated their fight against new voting restrictions, Republicans moved swiftly to enact their proposals.",
      "For all of the energy Democrats poured into their flight from Austin and attempts to pressure Congress, the scene inside the Texas State House chamber on Thursday and Friday was largely one of an ordinary day of legislating, devoid of fireworks or protesters in the gallery. Only a somewhat greater number of television cameras hinted at the stakes of the vote.",
      "Mr. Murr opened the debate by pointing to moments in Texas history in which voting access had been broadened and denying that the current bill would suppress the votes of Black and Latino residents. \u201cThis is serious and thoughtful legislation,\u201d he said.",
      "Before the first Democrat spoke, the Republican speaker of the House, Dade Phelan, directed members \u201cto be civil and respectful\u201d during the debate and said he \u201cwould appreciate members not using the word racism this afternoon.\u201d",
      "More than two dozen Democrats maintained their absence from the Capitol even after a quorum had been established, exposing a rift in the party over how best to address an elections bill that they see as a threat to the voting rights of Texans of color.",
      "Several Texas Democratic representatives returned to Washington earlier in the week to be present on Tuesday for the passage in the U.S. House of Representatives of a major bill to restore elements of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, including federal oversight of state elections.",
      "The Texas representatives presented the new federal bill\u2019s House passage as a kind of victory for their walkout. But the legislation faces a likely Republican filibuster in the Senate."

      "The following is a transcript of President Biden\u2019s remarks on Thursday about an attack at the Kabul, Afghanistan, airport that killed scores of people, including at least 12 U.S. service members.",
      "It\u2019s been a tough day. This evening in Kabul, as you all know, terrorists attacked \u2014 that we\u2019ve been talking about, and worried about, that the intelligence community has assessed \u2014 has undertaken an attack by a group known as ISIS-K. Took the lives of American service members standing guard at the airport, and wounded several others seriously. They also wounded a number of civilians, and civilians were killed as well.",
      "I\u2019ve been engaged all day, in constant contact with the military commanders here in Washington and the Pentagon as well as in Afghanistan and Doha. And my commanders here in Washington and in the field have been on this with great detail, and you\u2019ve had a chance to speak to some so far.",
      "The situation on the ground is still evolving, and I\u2019m constantly being updated. These American service members who gave their lives \u2014 it\u2019s a overused word but it\u2019s totally appropriate here \u2014 were heroes, heroes who have been engaged in a dangerous, selfless mission to save the lives of others.",
      "They are part of an airlift and evacuation effort unlike any seen in history, with more than 100,000 American citizens, American partners, Afghans who helped us and others taken to safety in the last 11 days. Just in the last 12 hours or so another 7,000 have gotten out.",
      "They are a part of the bravest, most capable and the most selfless military on the face of the Earth, and they are a part of simply what I call the backbone of America. They are the spine of America. The best the country has to offer.",
      "Jill and I, our hearts ache, like I\u2019m sure all of you do as well, for all those Afghan families who lost loved ones, including small children, who have been wounded in this vicious attack, and we\u2019re outraged as well as heartbroken.",
      "Being the father of an Army major who served for a year in Iraq, and before that was in Kosovo as a U.S. attorney for the better part of six months in the middle of a war, when he came home after a year in Iraq, he was diagnosed like many, many coming home with an aggressive and lethal cancer of the brain.",
      "We lost. We have some sense, like many of you do, what the families of these brave heroes are feeling today. You get this feeling like you\u2019re being sucked into a black hole in the middle of your chest. There\u2019s no way out. My heart aches for you, and I know this: We have a continuing obligation, a sacred obligation to all of you, the families of those heroes. That obligation is not temporary. It lasts forever.",
      "The lives we lost today were lives given in the service of liberty, the service of security and the service of others. In the service of America. Like their fellow brothers and sisters in arms who have died defending our vision and our values in the struggle against terrorism, of the fallen this day, they are part of a great noble company of American heroes.",
      "To those who carried out this attack, as well as anyone who wishes America harm, know this: We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay. I will defend our interests and our people with every measure at my command.",
      "Over the past few weeks \u2014 I know many of you are probably tired of hearing me say it \u2014 we\u2019ve been made aware by our intelligence community that the ISIS-K, an archenemy of the Taliban, people who were freed when both those prisons were opened, has been planning a complex set of attacks on the United States personnel and others. This is why from the outset I\u2019ve repeatedly said this mission was extraordinarily dangerous and why I\u2019ve been so determined to limit the duration of this mission.",
      "As Gen. [Kenneth F.] McKenzie said, this is why our mission was designed, this is the way it was designed to operate, operate under severe stress and attack. We\u2019ve known that from the beginning. And as I\u2019ve been in constant contact with our senior military leaders \u2014 and I mean constant, around the clock \u2014 and our commanders on the ground throughout the day, they made it clear that we can and we must complete this mission and we will. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ve ordered them to do.",
      "We will not be deterred by terrorists. We will not let them stop our mission. We will continue the evacuation. I\u2019ve also ordered my commanders to develop operational plans to strike ISIS-K assets, leadership and facilities. We will respond with force and precision at our time, at the place we choose and the moment of our choosing.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know: These ISIS terrorists will not win. We will rescue the Americans in there. We will get our Afghan allies out, and our mission will go on. America will not be intimidated, and I have the utmost confidence in our brave service members who continue to execute this mission with courage and honor to save lives, and get Americans, our partners, our Afghan allies out of Afghanistan.",
      "Every day when I\u2019ve talked to our commanders, I asked them what they need, what more do they need, if anything, to get the job done. As they will tell you, I\u2019ve granted every request. I reiterated to them today on three occasions that they should take the maximum steps necessary to protect our forces on the ground in Kabul, and I also want to thank the secretary of defense and the military leadership at the Pentagon and all the commanders in the field. There has been complete unanimity from every commander on the objectives of this mission and the best way to achieve those objectives.",
      "Those who have served through the ages and have drawn inspiration from the Book of Isaiah, when the Lord says: \u201cWhom shall I send? Who shall go for us?\u201d The American military has been answering for a long time. \u201cHere I am, Lord. Send me. Here I am, send me.\u201d Each one of these women and men of our armed forces are the heirs of that tradition of sacrifice, of volunteering to go into harm\u2019s way to risk everything, not for glory, not for profit, but to defend what we love and the people we love.",
      "And I ask that you join me now in a moment of silence for all those in uniform and out of uniform, military and civilian, of giving the last full measure of devotion.",
      "Thank you.",
      "May God bless you all and may God protect the troops and all those standing watch for America. We have so much to do. It\u2019s within our capacity to do it. We just have to remain steadfast. Steadfast. We will complete our mission, and we will continue after our troops are withdrawn to find means by which we can find any American who wishes to get out of Afghanistan.",

      "FLORENCIA, Colombia \u2014 In June 1912, Leo Miller, a collector with the American Museum of Natural History, arrived in the Caqueta\u0301 region of Colombia, where the eastern foothills of the Andes melt into the forested lowlands of the Amazon basin.",
      "Miller was working for Frank Chapman, the celebrated curator of birds at the museum. Chapman suspected that Colombia\u2019s wildly varied topography had given rise to an unusual density of species, and sent collectors like Miller to bring him birds from all corners of the country to study.",
      "Miller set up camp on a farmstead called La Morelia, surrounded by what he described to his mentor as \u201ca perfect ocean of forest stretching out ahead as far as the eye can see.\u201d There, he and his Colombian assistants worked day and night, beleaguered by rain, malaria and insects. By the end of July, they had collected more than 800 birds for Chapman, who was thrilled.",

      "The team, led by Andr\u00e9s Cuervo, an ornithologist at Universidad Nacional in Bogot\u00e1, has organized six expeditions across Colombia, collecting birds and data for comparison with Chapman\u2019s; this was the fifth. The undertaking, called Alas, Cantos y Colores \u2014 Wings, Songs and Colors \u2014 is financed by the Colombian government, with the participation of research institutions in Colombia and the United States. Studies of species from the same place over long periods of time are rare in science, and this resurvey project stands to speak volumes about how tropical birds have responded to changes in land use and climate.",
      "A lot has changed in this part of Caqueta\u0301 since 1912. For one, the \u201cocean of forest\u201d has been reduced, after decades of expanded cattle grazing, to mere islands in a sea of pasture. Before arriving, the researchers had pored through satellite images in the hope of finding a forest big enough to sustain the kind of bird life they sought. A patch adjacent to the farm was the best they could do.",
      "This group comprised 10 Colombian biologists and one American. Half were women, most were in their 20s and 30s, and several lived and worked in the Caqueta\u0301 region. Importantly, the specimens they collected would not leave Colombia. Instead, they would be deposited in the public natural history collections of the Universidad Nacional. Ornithologists like Dr. Cuervo had spent much of their careers studying their own country\u2019s birds in foreign museums. The young scientists on this trip, Dr. Cuervo hoped, would not have to.",
      "The farm\u2019s owners, the Alvira family, had sent their horses into the pasture and allowed the scientists to turn the stable into a lab. Plastic card tables held syringes, vials, glass slides, rulers, scalpels and a lot of forms and lists.",
      "On the packed-earth floor sat a cooler with dry ice and a canister full of liquid nitrogen, which is needed to flash-freeze tissues for genetic studies. The supplies had arrived by tractor early that morning as the team made its hourlong hike from a nearby village. During the group\u2019s previous expedition to a highland forest in southern Colombia, the nitrogen had tumbled off the back of a mule that slipped on the trail, but was saved before it could spill.",
      "Outside in the forest, the team strung hundreds of feet of mist nets \u2014 loose, wispy netting that causes birds to become trapped in its pockets \u2014 as howler monkeys groaned from unseen perches. At two o\u2019clock, Juliana Soto, a biologist with the Instituto Humboldt in Colombia, carried in the expedition\u2019s first bird, labeled MOR-001 \u2014 MOR for Morelia \u2014 in a cotton bag hooked to a cord around her neck.",
      "It was a male striolated manakin, with a little green puff of a body and a proud red crest. In Colombia, people tend to call this family of birds saltarines, or jumpers, for the way that males gather and hop from branch to branch to impress an audience of females.",
      "In 1912, preparing birds for scientific study was a simpler process. Birds were shot in the field, with many never recovered. Soft tissues were discarded, and only skeletons and skins were conserved. Each body was dried, filled with cotton and tagged with information on who had collected the bird and the location and altitude of its capture.",
      "The technical and ethical demands of modern science require that greater care be taken with each specimen. A few on this team were veteran ornithologists; others were students, volunteers and newly minted professionals still mastering the challenges of fieldwork. The more experienced members helped the rest.",
      "Andrea Morales Rozo, who teaches biology at the Universidad de los Llanos in central Colombia, guided the team at the nets, from which she skillfully extricated birds unharmed. Ms. Morales Rozo has been studying the blackpoll warbler, a species that migrates between the Amazon and Canada; she was part of a group that recently compared museum specimens and field-caught birds and learned that the warbler\u2019s northward range had shifted by nearly 400 miles in 45 years.",
      "Dr. Cuervo, the expedition leader, offered calm, fatherly support to those at the processing table. It\u2019s not always obvious how best to describe a bird\u2019s colors, for example, and second opinions were often requested. Was a wing \u201cverde caf\u00e9,\u201d greenish brown? Or was it \u201cverde olivazo,\u201d olive green? Was a female bird\u2019s brood patch, the bare skin that warms the eggs, still smooth or becoming wrinkly?",
      "MOR-001 struggled in Ms. Soto\u2019s hand as she passed it to her colleague, Jessica D\u00edaz, a field biologist hired for the expeditions. The bird was photographed and logged. Ms. D\u00edaz labored to extract a tiny amount of blood from its jugular vein with a syringe, expressing the drops into a vial of alcohol. She then prepared herself to euthanize it with rapid cardiac compression, using fingers to apply firm pressure over the bird\u2019s heart. With this technique, small birds pass out within seconds and die in about half a minute. Large birds are anesthetized.",
      "Ms. D\u00edaz held MOR-001 under the table so as not to have to watch; her colleagues did the same whenever their turn came to sacrifice a bird. \u201cThis is the not-fun part,\u201d she said, softly.",
      "A few in the group, including Ms. Soto, avoid sacrificing birds, although they believe in the necessity of scientific collecting and participate in the process. \u201cI think it\u2019s hard on all of us,\u201d said Ms. Soto, whose high, mellifluous voice gave her a certain birdlike aura. \u201cBut it\u2019s really hard on me. It just stabs me through the heart.\u201d On this expedition, Ms. Soto assumed other jobs on the assembly line: cutting samples of pectoral muscle to drop into liquid nitrogen, calling out colors of beaks and feathers, gingerly tagging a leg.",
      "Each bird was wrapped tightly in plastic and placed on dry ice to await the next, more complex stages of dissection and preservation, which would occur at the university lab. By the time MOR-001 was in the cooler, swathed like a miniature mummy, several more bags wriggled on a wire above the table, and the heat of the afternoon was breaking.",
      "For long stretches of the next day, few birds came in. The researchers weren\u2019t used to this; normally, they would be too busy to even eat. \u201cMiller said in no location in Colombia did he do so well,\u201d Ms. Soto lamented after one fruitless return from the nets.",
      "A century earlier, Miller had brought back from this site a dozen varieties of antbirds, a family of insect-eating species that need the refuge of the darkness of thick tropical undergrowth.",
      "Most people associate the Amazon region with showy macaws and toucans, but to an ornithologist, the diverse antbirds are among its main draws. In a large, uninterrupted tract of forest, \u201cyou get overwhelmed by antbirds, by many species calling at the same time,\u201d Dr. Cuervo said.",
      "But antbirds avoid sunlight. With the forest so exposed, and with so much light now reaching the forest floor, the team wondered whether they could capture any antbirds at all.",
      "Before Dr. Cuervo and the rest of the group arrived, a small advance team had spent days conducting censuses of birds and bird song to better understand the composition of the local forest community. They heard no antbirds. They did hear the buzz of a chain saw.",
      "Census data is an important component of these expeditions, complementing data gleaned from the specimens. Last year, a group of Colombian ecologists successfully compared census data from one forest with Chapman\u2019s specimens, and concluded that the composition of bird life had drastically changed over 100 years. In a forest that once favored specialized species, the all-purpose generalists now dominated.",
      "\u201cBut if you\u2019re asking what has changed within a species, you need the actual bird,\u201d said Glenn Seeholzer, a research associate with the American Museum of Natural History who is part of the Colombia team. Species are not static; nor are bodies, behaviors or genes. Beaks grow or shrink over generations; feathers change in color or luster in response to different selective pressures. On a genetic level, the changes can be profound, revealing reduced or expanded diversity, an indicator of a population\u2019s ability to adapt to changing environments.",
      "Scientists are now able to extract some genetic material from old bird specimens by scraping the pads of the toes. By comparing data from birds collected on this trip with Chapman\u2019s, \u201cwe will be able to see how the genetic variation has shifted,\u201d Dr. Seeholzer said. \u201cThere are very few data sets for wild populations of birds that you could ask or answer these questions with.\u201d Once this series of expeditions is complete, at the year\u2019s end, the collections in both Bogot\u00e1 and New York \u201cwill be much more valuable than the sum of their parts,\u201d he said.",
      "The researchers conduct careful advance work that begins months before each expedition. This one required even more tact than usual. In this ranching community, Ms. D\u00edaz and two colleagues had knocked on the doors of nearly 100 families, many of them resettled here by the government after being displaced by armed groups. \u201cPeople were sensitive about us coming onto their land,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir land is all they have.\u201d",
      "Another delicate task involves explaining why and how they take birds, which the researchers try to do in as frank a manner as possible. Nelsy Ni\u00f1o, a researcher at the Instituto Humboldt who designs outreach for the expeditions, uses the analogy of a public library when talking to communities or groups of young people. Biological collections are part of the nation\u2019s heritage, knowledge that will be available for all Colombians for generations to come, she explains. \u201cWe also talk about collecting as taking a picture,\u201d she said. \u201cA specimen is like a photograph we took of an individual in a specific time and space.\u201d",
      "Ms. Ni\u00f1o and her team return some weeks after each collecting trip to report on their findings and hold workshops, part of an effort to increase interest in bird conservation and bird tourism in the countryside. In recent years, Colombia has promoted itself as the most bird-rich country in the world, but not all of its regions are equally poised to benefit.",
      "Caqueta\u0301 has been hard hit by deforestation. The region has lost 8.5 percent of its tree cover since 2000, according to Global Forest Watch. Land speculation and cattle grazing, along with waves of resettlement and colonization, have all contributed.",
      "Two members of the expedition, Mauricio Cu\u00e9llar and Xiomara Capera Espinosa, both work as birding guides and hope to build interest in the region\u2019s fauna. Here on these farming plots, it was up to families like the Alviras to decide whether to save remnant forests for the sake of their bird life, which they valued. Off and on during this trip, as the rest of the team sat hunched over the processing table, Ms. Ni\u00f1o gently coached the youngest member of that family, the 6-year-old Daniel D\u00edaz Alvira, in bird identification using a guide.",
      "Most of the team had read Chapman\u2019s and Miller\u2019s writings about Colombia. Chapman\u2019s 1917 book, \u201cThe Distribution of Bird-Life in Colombia,\u201d has been an especially important reference for the country\u2019s ornithologists, virtually all of whom have participated in the resurvey project in some form or another. The roots of the effort date back to 1994, when the ornithologist Gustavo Kattan first used Chapman\u2019s data to show that certain species had disappeared from a forest near Cali.",
      "Dr. Cuervo, who studies the evolution of Neotropical birds, called Chapman\u2019s work \u201cinspirational.\u201d Chapman \u201claid out a number of ideas that we can now test with modern tools,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a story of our birds, a history and pattern that you want to understand.\u201d",
      "But it was not lost on this team that both Chapman and Miller expressed racist views. In their books, Black and Indigenous people are disparaged. They seldom named the Colombians who helped them find, collect and prepare their birds, content to label them \u201cunskilled native assistance,\u201d \u201cpeons\u201d or worse.",
      "The expeditions straddle an awkward line, being at once a tribute to Chapman\u2019s work and a conscious departure from scientific practices and attitudes that have come to be labeled \u201ccolonial,\u201d or at the very least unequal. Even into the current century, scientists in tropical countries have tended to be seen as \u201cthe ones that will deal with the permits, the ones who know how to get to the place, and that\u2019s it,\u201d Dr. Cuervo said.",
      "Dr. Cuervo stressed that he did not view this group\u2019s work as a repudiation of their predecessors. \u201cIt would be easy to point out all their defects,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were writing in their time. In our time, we\u2019re creating a more participatory science, a more global science, with our own diversity and our own tools.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to create high-quality bird collections for the sake of accumulation, or out of nationalism,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this because we need this.\u201d",
      "After several days at the Alvira farm, the team changed sites, striking a camp near a more promising patch of forest. Stands of rare palms and bamboo survived in this remnant, which bordered a wide, sandy river. The site was even closer to the old La Morelia estate, and on it they did better.",
      "By the end of their time in Caquet\u00e1, they had collected some 400 birds representing more than 100 species. Ten were what they called focal species, which could be compared, morphologically and genetically, with birds in the Chapman collection.",
      "These included wedge-billed woodcreepers, which use their curved tail feathers to anchor themselves to tree trunks; silver-beaked tanagers, whose brilliant white lower bills earned them the nickname come-queso, or cheese-eater, in Spanish. There were scarlet-crowned barbets \u2014 small fruit-eating birds related to toucans \u2014 and yellow-browed sparrows, an edge-dwelling species that seemed as poised as any to thrive in a new world of micro-forests surrounded by grasslands.",
      "Most of these were common, widely distributed species, Dr. Cuervo noted, and no more than a dozen of each had been taken, meaning that on a population level the collecting was of little consequence. \u201cWe don\u2019t deny that there is an impact to the individual bird,\u201d he said. \u201cWe remove it. But what we put in the balance is what we can learn.\u201d",
      "It appeared \u2014 although the hard work to quantify this had yet to begin \u2014 that at least some of the bird life present in 1912 was still hanging on, even in vastly diminished habitats.",
      "But many bird families were missing, among them the antbirds. The group left with just three, of a single species."

    "content": [
      "JACKSON, Miss. \u2014 On the ground floor of a parking garage at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, there are coronavirus patients where the cars should be \u2014 about 20 of them on any given day, laid up in air-conditioned tents and cared for by a team of medical personnel from a Christian charity group. Another garage nearby has been transformed into a staging area for a monoclonal antibody clinic for Covid-19 patients.",
      "These scenes, unfolding in the heart of Mississippi\u2019s capital city, are a clear indication that the health care system in the nation\u2019s poorest state is close to buckling under the latest avalanche of cases triggered by the highly contagious Delta variant of the virus.",
      "\u201cWe have reached a failure point,\u201d Dr. LouAnn Woodward, the medical center\u2019s top executive, said late last week. \u201cThe demand has exceeded our resources.\u201d",
      "The current coronavirus spike has hit the South hard, but a combination of poverty and politics made Mississippi uniquely unprepared to handle what is now the worst coronavirus outbreak in the nation. The state has fewer active physicians per capita than any other. Five rural hospitals have closed in the past decade, and 35 more are at imminent risk of closing, according to an assessment from a nonprofit health care quality agency. There are 2,000 fewer nurses in Mississippi today than there were at the beginning of the year, according to the state hospital association.",
      "\u201cIf you look around, the state\u2019s hospitals were in bad shape before there was such a thing as Covid,\u201d said Marty Wiseman, an emeritus political science professor at Mississippi State University. \u201cIt was not a good time to layer a pandemic on top of that.\u201d",
      "Mississippi has waged decades of political battles over health care policy that can run almost as hot as the fights over the symbols of the old Confederacy. Most crucially, the state rejected a proposal to expand Medicaid, the federally subsidized health insurance program for low-income residents, a decision that critics say has deprived Mississippi of a much-needed infusion of federal money that might have strengthened small hospitals on the brink of failure and allowed them to recruit and retain doctors and nurses. That debate is being revisited by advocates who hope the pandemic will force a new reckoning.",
      "What Mississippi has been left with, after years of infighting, is a system believed to be the weakest in the nation. According to a 2020 report from the Commonwealth Fund, a New York nonprofit group, Mississippi ranks at or near the bottom among states on key health care measurements, including infant mortality, childhood and adult obesity, and adults who have gone without care because they could not afford it.",
      "The hospitals that have shut down in recent years cited the same factors plaguing many of those still operating in the state: not enough money from patients with private insurance, not enough government help to care for the poor. Money is also at the root of the health care personnel shortage: Doctors and nurses can often make significantly more money elsewhere.",
      "The hospital closures have meant real challenges for local communities. Quitman County Hospital, in a sparsely populated corner of northwest Mississippi, was the only hospital in a 25-mile radius when it closed, creating a particular hardship in medical emergencies. In Newton, a small community about 65 miles east of the capital, the shutdown of Pioneer Community Hospital meant the loss of 150 jobs.",
      "And across the state, a shortage of health care workers has shrunk access to high-quality care. The dearth of physicians is so acute in some areas that in 2019, before the pandemic, legislators considered exempting newly licensed doctors from paying income taxes for 10 years if they agreed to work in underserved communities.",
      "Mississippi, as of Friday, was averaging 108 new cases per 100,000 residents over a seven-day period \u2014 a crisis fueled by a dismal statewide vaccination rate of 37 percent and made worse by a shortage of professionals to care for the sick. Memorial Hospital in Gulfport has canceled brain and heart surgeries due to a lack of available intensive care unit beds. Most days, Dr. Woodward\u2019s hospital, the largest in the state, has upward of two dozen patients waiting in the emergency ward and other parts of the hospital for intensive care beds to free up. State officials are even trying to outsource some of the state\u2019s sickest patients; Kentucky\u2019s public health commissioner, Dr. Steven J. Stack, said this week that hospitals in his state had fielded requests from Mississippi officials who were hoping to send them \u201cI.C.U.-level-care patients.\u201d",
      "But as Mississippi opens its new war on the virus, it can sometimes seem like a state at war with itself.",
      "Gov. Tate Reeves, a first-term Republican, recently declined to call a special session of the Legislature, a move supported by legislative leaders who had hoped to quickly allocate $1.8 billion in federal relief money to state health workers.",
      "The Reeves administration announced last week that it was signing up more than 1,000 contract health care workers to address the hospital labor shortage, at a cost of $10 million per week \u2014 a cost that will eventually be borne by the federal government. The news was at once welcomed by beleaguered frontline health workers and derided as hypocritical by critics of Mr. Reeves, who declared in his first State of the State address that \u201cbig government intervention creates as many problems as it solves.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe big government that some in the state are critical of has basically come here to save our collapsing health care system,\u201d said Derrick T. Simmons, a Democrat and the State Senate minority leader.",
      "Though Mr. Reeves has encouraged vaccinations and mask wearing to combat the virus, he has also sent mixed messages, calling the latest guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on indoor mask wearing \u201cfoolish.\u201d He recently upbraided a reporter for wearing a mask at an indoor news conference, calling it an act of virtue signaling.",
      "Still, persuading people to get the vaccine has become a top priority. Archie Manning, the former University of Mississippi football star, recently recorded a radio spot in which he encouraged residents to get a shot. \u201cWe know the vaccine works,\u201d Mr. Manning says in the ad, \u201cbut only if you get it.\u201d",
      "The message hasn\u2019t reached everyone. Last week, the state government warned that increasing numbers of Mississippians were calling the state poison control center after ingesting a drug often used for livestock deworming, which some erroneously believe can protect against the virus.",
      "That same day on WMPR 90.1 FM, a community radio station in Jackson, listeners heard a fiery sermon by a pastor who argued that Covid precautions were unnecessary for those who enjoyed God\u2019s protection.",
      "Those interested in improving health care in the state have long faced daunting odds. A succession of conservative governors has decried the cost of Medicaid, which is shared by the federal and state governments. Former Governor Haley Barbour, a Republican who served from 2004 to 2012, backed steep cuts to the program, including a divisive plan, eventually blocked by a judge, to remove 65,000 older adults and disabled people from the Medicaid rolls. He also suggested that people were gaming the system.",
      "\u201cForgive me if I think people who work two or three jobs to pay for health care for their families shouldn\u2019t be forced to pay for health care for people who can work, but choose not to,\u201d he said in 2011.",
      "Mr. Barbour\u2019s successor, Phil Bryant, torpedoed a state health insurance exchange meant to be a component of President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. Mr. Bryant said at the time that he did not want to support Obamacare, as the act is known, because he feared it would saddle the state with oppressive debts related to Medicaid.",
      "Mr. Reeves and the Mississippi Legislature \u2014 like the legislative bodies in a dozen states with Republican-controlled statehouses \u2014 continue to oppose Medicaid expansion, despite a renewed push for the program from state health care advocates who insist that money from the program might have helped Mississippi better weather the pandemic.",
      "Mississippi\u2019s hospitals have even proposed a plan that would cover the state government\u2019s share of the cost with a tax on the hospitals themselves and small monthly premiums for those who would sign up.",
      "In Hattiesburg, Phyllis Chambers-Berry, the chief nursing officer at Forrest General Hospital, said she believed that expanding Medicaid before the pandemic would have left her hospital in a stronger position to deal with the Delta variant. Now, with her hospital\u2019s 50 intensive care beds full, she said she was hoping the state would send 26 contract workers who would allow the hospital to open 10 more beds.",
      "Those workers would represent just a fraction of what Forrest General actually needs. The hospital has 240 nursing jobs that are unfilled, Dr. Chambers-Berry said. Of those who remain, she said, \u201cI could tell you from the looks on their faces \u2014 they\u2019re exhausted.\u201d"

      "After \u201cwobbling around,\u201d as the National Hurricane Center put it late Thursday, Ida on Friday resumed a more stable track heading northwest, in effect guided by a ridge of high-pressure air off the Southeastern United States.",
      "The ridge was expected to move westward, forecasters said, which should keep the storm on that general track through the weekend, churning across the Gulf of Mexico and most likely making landfall in Louisiana late Sunday.",
      "Ida had maximum sustained winds of nearly 65 miles per hour midday Friday and became a Category 1 hurricane, with winds above 73 m.p.h., before making landfall in western Cuba.",
      "The crucial question, for residents and emergency authorities along the Gulf Coast, is how much stronger it will become in the days after it passes Cuba and before landfall.",
      "The hurricane center said that the storm should strengthen steadily into Saturday, but after that it could grow much stronger very rapidly. Ida could become a major hurricane \u2014 defined as Category 3 or higher, with maximum sustained winds of at least 111 m.p.h. \u2014 in the 24 hours before landfall.",
      "Research over the past decade has found that, on average, such rapid intensification of hurricanes is increasing, in part because the oceans, which provide the energy for hurricanes, are getting warmer as a result of human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases.",
      "The hurricane center defines rapid intensification as at least a 35-m.p.h. increase in sustained winds over 24 hours. In the extremely active 2020 season, Hurricane Laura intensified by 45 m.p.h. in the 24 hours before making landfall in Louisiana as a Category 4 storm in late August.",
      "The Gulf of Mexico is currently very warm, as it normally is near the end of summer, so there is more energy to fuel Ida. Wind shear, or changes in wind speed and direction, that had been affecting Ida\u2019s cyclonic structure was also expected to dissipate. The storm should then become more organized, which will allow it to strengthen more quickly.",
      "The storm is currently moving at about 15 m.p.h. Other recent research has shown an increasing trend in hurricanes slowing down, or stalling, as they approach the coast.",
      "Last September, Hurricane Sally slowed to about 2 to 3 m.p.h. as it neared the coast of Alabama. Should Ida slow down, it would likely dump its large amounts of rain over a smaller area, potentially making flooding worse."

      "In the summer of 2020 I was \u2014 and there\u2019s no fancy way to put this \u2014 falling apart. My mother died that March, just after Covid hit. My father died a few years before. Strung between the fixed poles of my parents\u2019 deaths were the loss of my marriage, Trump\u2019s election and the sudden and, it seemed to me, inexplicable deaths of my two best friends.",
      "On March 16, 2017, my friend Sean Fahrlander woke up coughing. He stumbled across the bedroom in his house near the Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation and collapsed on the floor. By the time his partner got there, he was dead. Not even a year later, my other friend, Dan Jones \u2014 whose Ojibwe name was Gaagigebines \u2014 went for a walk with his daughter after dinner around the small Ojibwe reserve northeast of Fort Frances where he was from. He, too, coughed and tried to clear his throat. He told his daughter that he wasn\u2019t feeling well and that she should get the car. By the time she ran home and came back with her mother, he was in the middle of a massive heart attack.",
      "They were my guys, and when I got the news about Sean and then Dan, I collapsed but continued living somehow. One moment I would be fine, the next, inarticulate with rage and the next numb and unknowing. There\u2019s an old joke that goes something like this: An anthropologist asked a Native elder what the world is made out of, and the elder tells him that the earth rests on the back of a turtle. What, wondered the anthro, does the turtle rest on? Another turtle. And what does that turtle rest on? The elder says: Look, it\u2019s just turtles all the way down. I might have been the earth, but my grief was a bit like those turtles. Or at least that\u2019s how it felt \u2014 a huge stack of loss with no bottom to it. Then in August of last year, I started dreaming about Jim McDougall.",
      "I grew up on the Leech Lake Reservation in Minnesota; Jim\u2019s place was roughly an hour and a half southwest, on the White Earth Reservation. Our reservations are close and closely related: Both house the same tribe (the Ojibwe, also known as the Chippewa), we share the same homelands and our religious societies are intertwined. White Earth was originally made by strong-arming families to move there from the Leech Lake, Mille Lacs, Turtle Mountain and Fond du Lac reservations, so we are related by blood too. My family was part of that coercive migration, and most of my family is officially enrolled at White Earth, though none of us have ever lived there.",
      "I only know Jim at all because we had been a part of the Big Drum. Ojibwe Big Drum society, or \u201cdrum,\u201d as we call it, is a large, loud, social healing ceremony that takes place in dance halls designated specifically for that purpose in communities mostly in Minnesota and Wisconsin, throughout the year. To be seated on a drum, to be a member of the society, is both an honor and a profound, lifelong duty.",
      "I\u2019d always admired Jim and watched as he danced \u2014 a little bowlegged in that way of Ojibwe men, but light on his feet. And I had heard him joking with other drum members, watched as he threw his head back and directed his laughter at the ceiling. After the dreams started, I felt that I had to see Jim in particular, but also sit with other men like him. I felt that they could help me unravel everything that was tangled up inside of me, could help my heart find some kind of peace.",
      "My dreams about Jim hadn\u2019t been specific \u2014 no clear directions or visions \u2014 just a repeated slumbery tap on the shoulder. As a Vietnam vet, Jim was part of a long fighting tradition. It was because of that service that he was also part of Big Drum. It, like Jim, was born out of war.",
      "Around 1750, a large Ojibwe war party armed with French guns and powder attacked a Dakota village at Mille Lacs Lake (Bde Wakhang in the Dakota language) from the north. They slaughtered Dakota in the open and dumped bags of powder down the smoke holes in the Dakota lodges, burning women and children alive. The Dakota fled down the Rum River and spread out to the west and south into the plains. The loss of their forest homelands was deeply felt and often remembered. In the decades that followed, the Dakota and my tribe lived together and in tension: We found a strange way to not get along. We intermarried and traded and lived with Dakota near our borders and fought with and destroyed and were destroyed by Dakota farther away. As Gen. Jacob L. Devers remarked in relation to working with the French during World War II: \u201cFor many months we have fought together \u2014 often on the same side.\u201d Kind of like that.",
      "Roughly 100 years after the war party\u2019s attack, a Dakota entourage arrived in Mille Lacs bearing a ceremonial gift for the Ojibwe who had conquered them, a shocking kind of grace in the face of grief and loss. They were received and feasted, and the Dakota presented a drum and a ceremony to the assembled Ojibwe. They were told that the ceremony was one of peace meant to forever close the wound of our mutual bloodletting.",
      "The Ojibwe were instructed to pick, or \u201cseat,\u201d people for different positions in the ceremonial society. They were told that every member who was seated should be someone who had killed a Dakota person in close warfare, people who had \u201ctouched blood.\u201d They were also told that as the years passed and the ceremony spread to other communities, they would run out of people who had killed a Dakota and could then seat people who had killed other enemies. Eventually, if they stuck to the ceremony and its message of peace, they would run out of people who had killed anyone at all.",
      "Beyond the history, it\u2019s hard to know what to say about Big Drum, because it\u2019s hard to know what I can say about it. The Oneida comic Charlie Hill once said his tribe was originally from what is now New York, but the tribe migrated to Wisconsin because they had a \u201clittle real estate problem.\u201d Almost all tribes have. But we also suffer from a curiosity problem: outsiders peering in and fetishizing us with a collector\u2019s obsession. So we\u2019re protective, secretive, often mute (in public at least) about our ceremonies.",
      "Big Drum, however, is a little different. It is possible to talk about it somewhat. At its most basic level, the Big Drum is quite literally a big drum, originally made out of a hollowed-out tree trunk but subsequently out of barrels cut in half, with a raw hide stretched over the open ends, painted, decorated. It is also a ceremony (made up mostly of singing, talking, eating and dancing), and it is a society (made up of people from the community in which the drum sits). Big Drum exists to heal people from physical, psychological and social pain and grief. Outsiders are welcomed there. I\u2019m not sure why. It could be that, like the first Big Drum brought by the Dakota, the whole thing is meant to heal communities and close the distance between them. In any event, it is one of the few outward-facing Ojibwe ceremonies, and visitors are invited to come and mingle and partake.",
      "I didn\u2019t grow up going to drum with my family. It was something that my older brother, Anton, and I grew into. We began going about 30 years ago, not as drum members and not as spectators \u2014 drum dances aren\u2019t a spectator sport. We just went to be there, to hang out with the people, to spend time with friends. Later, Anton was seated on a drum and then, nearly a decade after that, around 2005, I was approached and asked to be a part of a drum society, too. It\u2019s hard to say, and feels strange to do so, how many times I went to drum before I was seated or after. As strange, I suppose, as asking Catholics how many times they\u2019ve been to Mass. Drums just happen. You go to them. When you\u2019re a member, you go to them a lot: your society\u2019s, other local ones. It would be nice to think that I was seated because I was important. It would be more honest to say that I was dependable.",
      "There are still positions on the drum, however, that can only be held by veterans. Among their duties is to put families who have suffered a tragic loss into mourning and to, at the right time, take them out of it. The thinking is that only veterans \u2014 those who have risked themselves in combat, those who carry the grief of their own losses as much as the agony they feel at having taken lives \u2014 truly understand the meaning, the terrible weight, of life and death. And they are the only ones who can help us heal from it. There\u2019s something to it.",
      "Jim\u2019s trailer sits on a slight rise above the shores of Strawberry Lake, caught in spangled glimpses among the leaves of oak and maple, in the middle of White Earth Reservation. Strawberry Lake is small, gorgeous, intimate in the way of lakes in northern Minnesota. \u201cThis is it, this is it right here,\u201d Jim said last August as he opened his arms to embrace the trailer, the maples, the lake, everything.",
      "Jim has wide, powerful shoulders and huge, crushing hands. But despite all that strength, there\u2019s a lightness to how he moves, or there was: He\u2019s very sick now. He used to have long salt-and-pepper hair and a mustache that reminded me of old-time Ojibwe leaders\u2019 in photos. I\u2019ve known Jim for about 25 years. I don\u2019t know him well, but he feels familiar, uncle-y.",
      "In 1971, Jim was nearing the end of high school when he volunteered for the Navy. \u201cI broke up with a girl I\u2019d gone with for a few years there, and I waited till after school was out, and I talked to my cousin and told him what I was going to do. He said, \u2018I\u2019ll go with you.\u2019 We stayed drunk for a week. Took the train over to Fargo. Signed some papers.\u201d He was inducted into the Navy after he graduated.",
      "I asked him why, during the height of Vietnam, he volunteered. He shrugged and said, \u201cI wanted to be like my dad.\u201d A lot of people at White Earth, and by extension from Native communities across the country, volunteered for the armed forces for the same reasons: tradition and the lack of other opportunities. Off Jim went. First to Naval Station Great Lakes, and then to his shipside assignment on an aircraft carrier.",
      "While on the carrier, he worked in aviation fuels. \u201cIt was dangerous work,\u201d he said, \u201cbombs and fuel everywhere. A lot of people died from accidents.\u201d He did his years and got out, but there \u201cwasn\u2019t [expletive] going on in the \u201970s.\u201d He worked as a mechanic for a while, but that wasn\u2019t enough, so he went back in. \u201cI was in for a total of 11 years. I thought maybe I could make it a career. It didn\u2019t work out, though.",
      "\u201cI got in trouble with my drinking and stuff like that,\u201d he says of his service after re-enlisting. \u201cBut a lot of guys do. To hang in there with everyone else, I had to learn how to drink.\u201d Then the drinking started to show. \u201cMy division officer called me and told me I had a choice.\u201d He could go to treatment or get out. \u201cI got out. They let me go with an honorable discharge. I tried to get back in later, but they said no.\u201d",
      "Jim is modest and self-effacing. He resists the impulse to draw larger meaning from his life. As he put it, he liked being in the service and was happy (if that\u2019s the right word) to serve during Vietnam. The fact that he kept trying to re-enlist, that a man would go back into the Navy soon after he fought in such a war, says something. I don\u2019t know what the toll of that service was for Jim. But serving in a war, killing even if by proxy, seeing death, being responsible for it, all of that changes a person.",
      "My father was changed twice, once as a Jew during the Holocaust when others were trying to kill him, and again only a few short years later when he served in the Philippines and Okinawa, his force intent on killing other people. The same is true for my mother\u2019s father, Ojibwe, from Leech Lake Reservation, who also served in World War II, but his war was much worse. He was bombed and shelled and frozen and forced to kill, over and over and over again. I\u2019m not sure if he was a nice man before, but he struggled to be one after he got back. The whole relationship between Native people and military service feels, to me, like a kind of simple arithmetic. We collectively grew up with a fair amount of pain, and then many of us joined the military and caused suffering that, directed at the enemy, bent backward and affected us. Some more deeply than others.",
      "Jim started to realize that he was an alcoholic. Blackouts, D.W.I.s, drying out in the drunk tank. Finally, after one bender, he woke up in jail still drunk. He started praying. \u201cI said: \u2018This is it. I\u2019m done.\u2019 And since November of 1990, I was done. Haven\u2019t had a drink since.\u201d Whatever dry well of pain that Jim might have been trying to fill with booze began, gradually, to be filled up with something else. He met his wife, Betsy, in 1992, and they\u2019ve been together ever since. In 1994 he was seated as a veteran on the Big Drum at White Earth. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t gotten involved with Betsy and her family, it would have taken me a lot longer to get involved and to get my life in order. I get something out of going to Big Drum. I get a good feeling in my head and in my heart.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s a process that sometimes occurs (not always or even often) during the Big Drum to help end a family\u2019s mourning called \u201cwash their tears.\u201d Typically, men will wash up men, and women will wash up women. I\u2019ve seen Jim do this many times over the years. A family is seated in chairs near the drum, and the veterans approach them with bowls of water and soap and combs. They literally wash the faces of the bereaved, and comb and braid their hair. These big men, with their strong hands, wash and comb with a delicacy you wouldn\u2019t think possible. In so doing, they wash away our sadness. Even though Jim hasn\u2019t washed me up, I\u2019ve always felt a kind of calm fall over me when I\u2019ve seen him help others with their grief. My breath comes easier. My hands don\u2019t play so fretfully. I felt similarly as I sat on Jim\u2019s porch and listened to him talk.",
      "He listened to me, too. We spoke of my mom and dad, and when I started talking about the death of my friend Sean, I became overwhelmed. Rather than cry, I drifted off into silence, or some version of it, as I stared at the lake between the trees.",
      "That old feeling, that feeling of being very small in the presence of my grief, kept me pinned to my chair. I finally managed to wonder out loud why the loss of my parents didn\u2019t rock me the way the death of my friend did. I wondered out loud that maybe it was hard to talk about Sean because he had come to stand in for all the losses: of my parents, and of other friends, my marriage, all of it. Maybe, I wondered, the problem wasn\u2019t that ghosts were real but that there were too many of them, too many to manage.",
      "\u201cMaybe,\u201d Jim said. \u201cThat could be.\u201d Jim is many things \u2014 a veteran, a ceremony man, a White Earther, a Vikings football fan. But he\u2019s not a Buddha.",
      "\u201cMy uncle had this black lab named Shine.\u201d Then Jim\u2019s voice broke. He fought back tears. \u201cThere\u2019s been more than one Shine. But the original. The original Shine was one [expletive] great dog. When we drove that truck into town, Shine would climb up on the top of the cab and ride like that. And he hunted, and he protected us. He was a family dog. He was just a mutt born in White Earth.\u201d Not unlike Jim, I thought. For that matter, not unlike me. Sometimes what hurts us and also what moves us, is profoundly ineffable. For me, infuriatingly so.",
      "Five years ago when I looked down at my father\u2019s dead body as it lay in the room at my brother\u2019s house, I felt nothing. When my mother lay dying in my sister\u2019s house a year ago, I wanted to leave. Yet if the sun catches the trees in a certain way, I think of my friend Dan, and I miss him so much I\u2019m made mute, frozen in my grief until the tears come and I am doubled over and then brought to the ground. Where we find relief can be just as hard to predict. Jim hadn\u2019t done anything grand for me. He hadn\u2019t washed me up or wiped my tears. But he\u2019d given me permission to look at my life and my feelings a little more closely. Because of Jim\u2019s personality and the power of his experience, he gave me space to think about something I hadn\u2019t given myself a chance to process.",
      "If we were at a ceremony, Jim would be able to help me directly. He would seat me in a chair and wash my face and head, and dress me in new clothes and dance for my grief. As a veteran, Jim has held the entire span of a person\u2019s existence in his hands. As a veteran, he has caused grief, and so \u2014 with wisdom or without it, intentionally or not \u2014 he can carry our grief, so we don\u2019t have to.",
      "Native people are keenly aware of what we\u2019ve given to this country. Across what would become the United States, Native people fought rapacious European powers and, when the time came, fought an expanding American government in order to protect themselves and their homelands. In the 19th century, the United States fought more wars against Indian tribes than it did against \u201cforeign\u201d powers, among them: Tecumseh\u2019s War (1811), the Creek War (1813-14), the First and Second and Third Seminole Wars (1817-18 and 1835-42 and 1855-58), the Arikara War (1823), the Winnebago War (1827), the Black Hawk War (1832), the Cayuse War (1847-55), the Apache Wars (1861-1900), the Puget Sound War (1855-56), the Rogue River Wars (1855-56), the Yakama War (1855-58), the Utah War (1857-58), the Navajo Wars (1848-68), the Paiute War (1860), the Yavapai Wars (1861-75), the Dakota War (1862), the Colorado War (1864-65), the Snake War (1864-68), the Powder River War (1865), Red Cloud\u2019s War (1865-68), the Comanche Campaign (1867-75), the Modoc War (1872-73), the Red River War (1874-75), the Great Sioux War (1876-77), the Buffalo Hunters\u2019 War (1877), the Nez Perc\u00e9 War (1877), the Bannock War (1878), the Cheyenne Campaign (1878), the Sheepeater War (1879), Victorio\u2019s War (1879-80), the White River Ute War (1879), the Pine Ridge Campaign (1890-91), the Yaqui Wars (1896-1918).",
      "Alongside these punitive, barely remembered wars were equally destructive federal policies directed at Native people and Native nations, such as the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which sought to shift all Indians from east of the Mississippi to Indian Territory in what is now Oklahoma. There was the General Allotment Act of 1887, which tried to dissolve tribes and tribal ownership of their homelands by assigning parcels to individual Indians to farm \u2014 this policy resulted in the loss of over 90 million acres and thrust Native people into seemingly perpetual cycles of poverty. There was also the federal policy of taking Native children from their homes and sending them to federally funded Indian residential schools, where they were forbidden to speak their tribal languages, practice their religion or wear their traditional clothing.",
      "In a speech he gave in 1886, Teddy Roosevelt said, \u201cI don\u2019t go so far as to think that the only good Indians are the dead Indians, but I believe nine out of every 10 are, and I shouldn\u2019t like to inquire too closely into the case of the 10th.\u201d We had suffered from American violence for centuries and we \u2014 as American allies and members of the armed forces \u2014 had visited violence on others. Violence defines the lives of Native people in ways unlike any other group of eventual Americans.",
      "In the modern era, beginning in 1914, Indians joined up in staggering numbers. Some from northern tribes walked or paddled across the border to Canada and enlisted. Many didn\u2019t. Barely 1 percent of Navajo and Pueblo men served in the Allied Expeditionary Force. In contrast, 39 percent of Osage and 54 percent of Quapaw men from Oklahoma did. By war\u2019s end, the U.S. War Department estimated that more than 17,000 Indian men registered. Sixty-five hundred were drafted. The rest volunteered. All in all, as much as 30 percent of the adult Indian male population participated in World War I, double the national average.",
      "The Indian boarding schools were a rich source of volunteers. Schools like the Hampton institute and the Carlisle, Chilocco, Haskell and Phoenix Indian schools sent thousands of students off to war. Most of these schools had a military feel \u2014 students marched to class and wore uniforms and were better suited to Army life than most white Americans. Many were paid more, too: At boarding school they had received vocational training that qualified them for better billets, as carpenters\u2019 mates, shipwrights, blacksmiths, electricians and colliers, among others.",
      "But a majority were sent to the infantry. They were there to shoot and be shot. Most likely aware of America\u2019s sins, they nonetheless believed in and were committed to the American cause. During W.W.I, Native people raised over $25 million in war bonds, equivalent to $75 per Native American alive.",
      "Indian soldiers descended into modern mechanized war. They lived below ground in the dark, tormented by rats and the sweet stench of rotting corpses. They endured trench foot and dysentery. They were gassed and bombed and picked off by snipers. Among the sufferers was Sgt. Otis W. Leader, a Choctaw tribal member and machine-gunner in the 16th Infantry Regiment. Leader fought at Soissons, Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry, Saint-Mihiel and the Argonne Forest. He was wounded and gassed multiple times.",
      "Sgt. Thomas Rogers and Joe Young Hawk (both Arikara) fought at Soissons. Rogers was an incredible soldier and was cited for bravery after he captured, \u201cat night, barehanded and alone,\u201d many German sentinels. During the same battle, Young Hawk was nabbed by the Germans while on patrol. He turned on his captors and killed three with his bare hands. During the fight, he was shot through both legs but still managed to capture two Germans and march them back to American lines. The most daring, though, was Pvt. Joseph Oklahombi, a Choctaw. At Saint-\u00c9tienne, Oklahombi was among a group that rushed across 200 yards of open ground. Together they commandeered a German machine gun and turned it on the enemy, killing 79 Germans and taking 171 prisoners. They held them for four days before reinforcements arrived.",
      "It was during W.W.I that myths of Indian bravery and immunity to suffering were amplified. As with all myths, there is a bit of truth in them. Maj. Tom Riley, a commander in the 165th Infantry Regiment, wrote, \u201cIf a battle was on, and you wanted to find the Indians, you would always find them at the front.\u201d But it is just as true that you always found them at the front because the government put them there: Indians suffered casualty rates five times as high as the American Expeditionary Force as a whole. When they returned home \u2014 having fought and suffered for the country even though many of them were not American citizens and wouldn\u2019t be until the passage of the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 \u2014 they returned to trouble.",
      "At White Earth, where Jim\u2019s family is from, veterans came home to find their reservations clear-cut by aggressive and unscrupulous lumber companies in their absence. They left a forest and returned to a wasteland. It has been suggested that Joseph Oklahombi struggled with alcohol abuse when he returned from the war. He died on April 13, 1960, when he was struck by a truck while walking along a road.",
      "Not all veterans suffered. Navajo, Eastern Cherokee and Lakota veterans started American Legion posts. Those who traveled overseas had seen the world \u2014 France and Belgium and Germany and England \u2014 and picked up skills as clerks and bookkeepers and heavy-equipment operators and machinists and secretaries and trigger men. These veterans led their tribes into the second half of the 20th century. The government didn\u2019t always keep good statistics regarding the race of its military personnel (my grandfather listed \u201cwhite\u201d as his race on his induction paperwork in 1943), but Native people currently serve at five times the national average.",
      "I\u2019ve noticed that outsiders are fascinated by this. Why, after all, would Native people put their lives on the line for a country and people who tried to bury us? Why fight for a country that never fought for us? But some Native people have always thrown in with America. Others threw in with the British. Or the French. Or the Spanish. During the Civil War, some Natives joined the Confederates and others the Union Army. When the United States emerged triumphant from these early conflicts, Native people continued to join up. Some did it to carry forward older cultural ways of being. Others because they embraced the country that had grown up around them. And others still because it was the only path open to them.",
      "It may be hard to reconcile our service with how we\u2019ve been treated, but only if Native people are understood as merely Native. We are Native, sure. But we are also American. We are Native and American and we are men. We are women. We are trans. Whitman may have claimed that he contained multitudes, and Bob Dylan may have amplified the idea. But Native people, arguably, contain more.",
      "When I moved to California in 2011, there were times when I couldn\u2019t travel back home to help out on the drum. The drum I\u2019m on convenes twice a year \u2014 once in the fall and once again in the spring, year in, year out. When I separated from my wife two years later and became a single parent, it became even more difficult to attend a dance. Recently, Covid has meant that I haven\u2019t been to a drum in over a year. At first when I missed a dance, I felt that I was letting my community down. That has since given way to the fact that I just miss it. I miss the closeness I feel when I\u2019m around my people, the clusters of conversation and laughter that spring up here and there among people around the drum. I even miss the twitchy, nervous feeling I get when I have to speak or dance. I miss our words and our wordlessness. As the pandemic broke us apart and locked me in my house, as the horizon of my world increasingly became measured in the width of the bezels around my screen, I missed the raw awkwardness of the ceremony itself. And I also missed Joe Nayquonabe.",
      "Joe has been seated on nine drums, in a few different communities, which is extraordinary, because this means he spends half his weekends at a drum. Like Jim, he is a Vietnam War veteran. I\u2019ve known him for about as long as I\u2019ve known Jim and under the same circumstances: He\u2019s a Big Drum guy. He\u2019s the Belt Man on the drum. He\u2019s very dark and very big, with small deep-set eyes and large round cheeks. He is, to me, an impressive man, and I am uncharacteristically desperate for his approval.",
      "At drum he is punctual, and he has never, while I\u2019ve known him, missed a dance. Joe always dances last, because the Belt Man always dances last. I like watching him. He ties on the feather belt and dances earnestly. His face, usually friendly, becomes a mask, and he looks intently left and then right and then left again as if searching for something. The Belt Man is something of an \u201c\u00fcber veteran.\u201d A part of his job is to look after the souls of everyone at the dance, to make sure they are good and safe and protected, to catch any lingering badness or bad feeling and do away with it. The Belt Man\u2019s dance is like a hunting dance: searching low and high, maybe miming the loosing of an arrow. The quarry is danger, or terror, or bad feelings, or all of the above. When Joe dances, I feel that he can see me, he can see all of us and all our troubles.",
      "I arrived at his front door in Mille Lacs in August 2020 a few days after I visited Jim, almost in the shadow of the water tower emblazoned with the seal of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe Indians, not far from where, in 1750, our ancestors killed those Dakota by throwing gunpowder in their lodges while they were sleeping. Across the street, heavy machinery was tearing down and chewing up a rez house not unlike Joe\u2019s.",
      "\u201cDave! Come in, come in, come in!\u201d We sat down at his cluttered kitchen table, and he apologized for the noise outside. When I first reached out to Joe, I hadn\u2019t told him that I was selfishly hoping to get something for myself by talking, as I had with Jim. I wanted a kind of healing that could come only from hearing his story. Joe dove right into telling me about his past. \u201cI wasn\u2019t a gung-ho G.I. Joe kind of guy. I didn\u2019t have many options after high school, so when high school came around, they told me those were my choices \u2014 vocational school and the military. Right away I chose the military.\u201d",
      "But Joe was rejected: He had bad eyes and flat feet. He also had a criminal record. That left vocational training. Joe pursued it in Milwaukee as part of the relocation program begun in the mid-1950s: a government policy aimed at moving Native people from their reservations to urban centers where they would receive educational and employment opportunities. The purpose of the program was to \u201ccivilize\u201d Indian people.",
      "\u201cI went there and didn\u2019t have no clue what I wanted to do,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut my dad had been a welder in the shipyards over here during World War II. So the first thing that comes to my mind is welder. Got a pretty good job.\u201d Here Joe becomes reflective. \u201cBut when I talk about my civilization, I always tell them I learned the \u2018N word\u2019 and the \u2018Q word,\u2019 and I learned how to drink. That was my \u2018civilization.\u2019 I fought with that racism in myself a long time. I\u2019m still working on getting it out of my system.\u201d He is frank and clear, and he doesn\u2019t seem embarrassed, because shame isn\u2019t helpful. \u201cI\u2019m always working on it.\u201d",
      "While he was in Milwaukee learning to be civilized, a letter came for him back on the reservation informing him that he had to appear for a pre-induction physical. This was in 1965. The military didn\u2019t want him before, but they wanted him now. He was drafted. Death came close the first day he was \u201cin country,\u201d when a guy was killed next to him. \u201cWe were fighting a guerrilla war. Ambushes. Sudden explosions. You never really knew where they\u2019d be. Some of them were right in the villages farming, running little stores. At night they\u2019d ambush us and then they\u2019d go back to work in the village the next day. I wasn\u2019t prepared for what I was going to see \u2014 the death, the pain, the mangled bodies. Emotional and physical pain.\u201d That first day in combat, when one of the guys in his group was hit, they tried to give him an IV, but it was during the monsoon season. Rain like they had never seen in their lives. Joe tried to hold the man down so that others could insert the IV, but then he stopped breathing. \u201cRight away: death.\u201d",
      "Joe was in Vietnam for six months. By his count, he \u201cdropped in\u201d via helicopter at least 60 times, sometimes multiple times in a single day. I can\u2019t really imagine it. \u201cI looked at that as a duty, a job,\u201d he said. \u201cI took an oath: the Uniform Code of Military Justice. You\u2019re going to do this and that. Who the eff are you if you can\u2019t follow your oath?\u201d",
      "On Dec. 4, 1966, one of the guys in Joe\u2019s outfit was wounded. He was out in a field, screaming. \u201cNo one wanted to go after him. He was kind of lying out there. And there was lots of fire going on. I thought, Well, [expletive]. \u2018OK, you guys,\u2019 I said. \u2018You lay down a base of fire, and I\u2019m going to go get him.\u2019 They said, \u2018OK, Joe, go!\u2019\u201d Joe was shot in the back dragging the soldier to safety, an act of heroism that earned him the Bronze Star with a brass V for valor. That soldier still writes to him. Joe thinks he might be having a hard time. \u201cThe war will do that to you. I talk about that suffering at the drum. Lots of those guys are in mental hospitals. When I look back, I think maybe I should be there, too.\u201d He laughs. Joe\u2019s service in the field ended that day because of his wound. He was afraid he\u2019d be sent back to Vietnam after he healed, but he was not.",
      "Joe and his family have been involved in Big Drum probably since the drum first arrived at Mille Lacs with the Dakota in the mid-18th century. He was seated when he was 9. But despite that long connection and the safety and healing that drum societies confer, he struggled when he got back from the war. \u201cI didn\u2019t think nothing of the drums. I was 21, and I didn\u2019t care. Who wants it? These [expletive] tom-toms. These damn Indians! Again: I was civilized, remember? And these guys? They\u2019re crazy. I wanted to go down to the Blue Goose bar and roughhouse with the farmers. Let\u2019s go to Onamia and party with the rednecks!\u201d Mostly he drank. And mostly he drank because he had terrible, recurring nightmares, four of them in steady rotation.",
      "The first dream was about one of Joe\u2019s early missions, when he was deployed to protect an artillery unit. They were shelled by friendly fire. \u201cWe took off running,\u201d Joe remembered, \u201cand the first guy I come to had no face. He\u2019s lying there, and he\u2019s telling me to kill him.\u201d Joe tried to assure him he\u2019d be OK. Then the doctor showed up, and Joe left not knowing what happened to the man. In his nightmares, he hears a knock on his door. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter where I am \u2014 my house or a trailer or wherever,\u201d he describes. \u201cIt\u2019s him, and he\u2019s still missing his face. He\u2019s saying to me, \u2018Why didn\u2019t you kill me?\u2019\u201d",
      "The second dream is even more brutal. Like the one before, it\u2019s based in something that happened in the field: \u201cWe were walking, and me and this guy were on point, and we took a smoke break. We heard something and went over there, and there\u2019s this 12- or 13-year-old girl, and her gun is jammed, and she\u2019s trying to fix it.\u201d They told her to put her gun down. They offered her a little card that said that if she surrendered, she wouldn\u2019t be hurt and she would be fed. \u201cI went over there and gave it to her, and she took it and ripped it in half and spit on it and threw it back at me. Well then her gun unjammed and she was ready to put it on me, and my buddy opened up on her. Boom boom boom. Stomach, chest, throat.\u201d They went over to try to help her, but she was hollering and swearing at Joe. \u201cTo her dying breath, she was cursing me.\u201d In the dream, however, \u201cher gun comes loose, and she\u2019s ready to let me have it, and I wake up.\u201d",
      "He pauses as one of his daughters and some kids come in the house from running errands.",
      "In the third dream, also based on something that happened to him, he and a group of soldiers are walking through an open field. They start to spread out to make themselves less of a target. Then he notices a water buffalo standing in the open. \u201cHe was big. I walk by, and he\u2019s looking at me. Something must have happened because they opened up behind me. I look back and you can see the tracers going into him.\u201d The buffalo starts running around and goes down but eventually gets back up, covered in blood. \u201cHe\u2019s blood. Nothing but blood. In my dream he\u2019s standing there all bloody and he comes after me. One-hundred-some guys and he comes after me! I start running and I\u2019m doing good, but I start slowing down, and then I fall down and he\u2019s on me. And then I wake up.\u201d",
      "The fourth dream is simpler: \u201cI get sent back.\u201d",
      "Joe eventually quit drinking, but quitting didn\u2019t make him any happier. \u201cI was pissed off at everybody. The welfare people, the unemployed, freeloaders. I thought white people were right \u2014 we are lazy, no-good alcoholics. I was really a mess.\u201d Joe used to visit a couple of World War II vets from a nearby community. By his own account, he was so far gone he thought it was a good idea to show them photos from Vietnam. When he was there, Joe got hold of a camera and started snapping pictures of dead bodies, both people he had killed and others he had found. It was an awful habit. The vets told him to burn the pictures. But Joe was stubborn and refused. A short while later, his mom\u2019s house burned down with all his stuff inside, including the pictures. \u201cNow when an elder says something, I listen.\u201d",
      "At the drum, he continued, \u201cI started listening to the speakers, and I started asking questions about what my job was and why the drum looks the way it does and where these things come from. All of a sudden, the nightmares quit. They quit. The drums are the ones that keep me sober and happy and on the right road. They are good to me. I don\u2019t think I would be here today without them.\u201d",
      "I began my visit with Joe with a mixture of fear and admiration. Fear that Joe wouldn\u2019t like me. Admiration for how directly and humbly he addressed his own shortcomings. Our conversation often drifted back to the idea of duty \u2014 to yourself, to the community, to forces outside ourselves. For Joe as much as in Ojibwe tradition, duty is related to help and care more so than to violence and destruction. \u201cIf you don\u2019t keep your vows, what good are you? I always thought about that \u2014 it means something to give your word to people and to the creator. If you don\u2019t keep your word and your vows, what good are you?\u201d",
      "Sixteen years ago, I was approached by a drum owner of a drum at White Earth. And I was seated as a \u201cdrumheater.\u201d At the time, my brother told me that a drumheater, Abiigizigewinini, was an important position. We are the only ones allowed to physically move the drum from the home of the owner to the dance hall. We are the first to arrive at the ceremony and usually the last to leave. The dance can\u2019t proceed without our contributions and approval. Being there first, staying last, being present \u2014 that has become my duty.",
      "It\u2019s worth reminding ourselves of our duty to one another, and to ourselves. I am not from the kind of place where epiphanies are all that common, and I\u2019m not the kind of person to recognize them when they occur. But I know this: When I talked to Jim, and again when I listened to Joe, I could breathe a little more easily.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s two words we use a lot at drum, two ideas: wiidookodaadidaa and zhawendidaa. Let\u2019s help each other, and let\u2019s care for each other,\u201d Joe said. \u201cIf we did those two things, our community and our whole world would be a better place. Those are the two words I live by. At my age I\u2019m getting a little slower. But I\u2019m getting to where I want to help. What can I do to help? I\u2019m here. If you need me, I\u2019m here.\u201d",
      "The story of the drum, of Jim and Joe, are not stories of atonement. Culturally speaking, we don\u2019t do atonement. Even the word feels strange on my tongue, an unfamiliar Christian flavor. What the Dakota gave my tribe was the responsibility and capacity to carry their grief for them: to tend it so they don\u2019t have to. What Jim and Joe offer me \u2014 personally, and in consideration of what I\u2019ve lost and the losses I\u2019ve inflicted on others \u2014 is not wisdom (though they both possess it), or absolution (that\u2019s not theirs to give), or even grace (that ever-elusive thing). What they offer is a much vaster peace by taking into themselves a sadness I can\u2019t carry. I think it would kill me if I tried.",
      "My siblings and I have decided that we will be \u201cwashed up\u201d at Big Drum in White Earth in the fall. We will be seated in chairs in the center of the dance hall, and the veterans will attend to us. They will, one by one, dance around us. They will speak about their authority to wipe away our grief. Our faces will be washed, and our hair will be combed and our faces streaked with red pigment. We will then eat as a family. When it is over, we will give away things our mother loved while she was alive (candy, warm blankets, fishing rods, but not the cigarettes that contributed to her death).",
      "I can\u2019t speak for my siblings, but the veterans will also wash away the loss of my father, and my friends, and the many who have died from Covid and the many who have died and continue to die at the hands of the police and the republic. In all likelihood Jim and Joe will do the washing.",
      "The magic and the healing my family will receive \u2014 if you believe in such things \u2014 reside in the connectedness between people and place that drum has to offer as much as in the spirits that enable the ceremony. When my parents were still alive, when Sean and Dan were still alive, when I was young, I traveled to the community of Lake Lena, near Pine City, Minn., to attend a funeral: a very elderly and much-revered spiritual leader named Albert Churchill had died that week. The wake began on Sept. 10, 2001, and went late into the night. The next day, as I drove from my hotel, I heard the news on the radio. I burst into the gymnasium where the funeral rites were about to begin. Something terrible has happened, I said. After the funeral was over, almost instinctively, a Big Drum owner brought the drum to the gym. It was impromptu. Not something that happens very often, not the usual scheduled drum dance. But it felt right and necessary to sound the drum to offer healing and support for the dead, the missing, for the country more generally.",
      "If Jim and Joe and the other Native veterans I\u2019ve talked to are to be believed, when the Dakota brought us the drum, a feeling of indebtedness and duty and profound concern displaced darker habits: of revenge, self-satisfaction, victimhood, self-righteousness, violence and reliance on the myth of our own innocence. My private, singular grief is still with me, though it sits in me differently. And it will be eased somewhat when my tears are washed away this fall. America is still the complicated, dreamy, enraged country it has been for a long time. Big Drum is, now, an old, powerful thing. But the ceremony was young once. It was once new because the world it appeared in was new. We needed that ceremony when it came to us that first time, we needed the drum that September and we need it now."

      "One of the last photos that Marine Sgt. Nicole Gee shared with her family from Afghanistan shows her in dusty body armor with a rifle, her long blond hair pulled back, her hands in tactical gloves. Amid the chaos of Kabul, those hands are carefully cradling a baby.",
      "It was a moment captured on the front lines of the airport, where Marines worked feverishly to shepherd tens of thousands of evacuees through chaotic and dangerous razor wire gates. It showed how, even in the tumult, many took time to comfort the families who made it through.",
      "In a short message posted with the photo, the sergeant said, \u201cI love my job\ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffc\u201d",
      "Sergeant Gee never made it out.",
      "She was one of the 13 troops killed when a suicide bomb ripped through the crowds at the gate this week, killing nearly 200 people. The Defense Department on Saturday officially identified the service members who were killed, and family and friends paid tribute to their lives and their sacrifice.",
      "\u201cShe believed in what she was doing, she loved being a Marine,\u201d her brother-in-law, Gabriel Fuoco, said. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have wanted to be anywhere else.\u201d",
      "Sergeant Gee, 23, of Roseville, Calif., was one of two women in uniform killed at the gate. The other was Marine Sgt. Johanny Rosario Pichardo, 25, of Lawrence, Mass. Sergeant Rosario was commended by her unit in May for excellence in a supply chief job usually given to someone of higher rank.",
      "\u201cHer service was not only crucial to evacuating thousands of women and children, but epitomizes what it means to be a Marine: putting herself in danger for the protection of American values so that others might enjoy them,\u201d Marine First Lt. John Coppola said about Sergeant Rosario in a statement.",
      "The two female sergeants volunteered for a job that in culturally conservative Afghanistan could have been carried out only by women: searching other women and children as they passed through the gates. But the two sergeants were also standout Marines in a force that is slowly changing, putting more women in combat roles and positions of leadership.",
      "For most of military history, women were not allowed in combat. The few admitted to the Marines largely did clerical work. In 2001, at the start of the war in Afghanistan, women Marines were not  assigned to gate duty, said Kate Germano, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel.",
      "But decades of insurgency wars fought in conservative Muslim countries forced the military to evolve. A conflict with no front lines often put women in combat, whether it was in their job description or not, and local cultures meant female engagement teams often had to accompany infantry troops on missions to interact with female Afghans.",
      "The Marine Corps slowly, often grudgingly, opened all combat jobs to women. They now make up about 9 percent of the force. It\u2019s still a small part of the force compared to other military branches, Ms. Germano said, \u201cBut every year, more women are out front, bearing the burden more equally with men.\u201d",
      "Expanding the rights of women, giving them access to education and work outside the home was for years one of the goals of American efforts in Afghanistan. As the Taliban advanced into Kabul, painting over ads depicting women in western dress and telling women to stay indoors, the nation saw much of that progress crumble. When Marines took over security at the airport gates, two young sergeants found themselves standing on the dividing line between a society opening opportunities for women, and one slamming them shut.",
      "Sergeant Gee grew up playing softball, never thinking she might one day join the military. But when her high school sweetheart, Jarod Gee, enlisted in the Marines, she decided to follow. They soon married.",
      "Described by her friends and family as vivacious, confident, bright, and strong, Sergeant Gee excelled in the Marines. She graduated from her corporal school at the top of her class and was meritoriously promoted ahead of peers to sergeant in Kuwait, not long before landing in Afghanistan.",
      "Photos from the airport show her walking young girls across the tarmac to a hulking cargo jet and standing guard next to long lines of Afghans walking up the ramp of one of the planes.",
      "She was not intimidated by the demanding, largely male world of the Marines, her family said.",
      "\u201cShe was a trailblazer in a sense,\u201d Mr. Fuoco said. \u201cWhen she did something, she did it all the way, and I really think she enjoyed trying to surpass the men.\u201d",
      "That included in physical feats. She held a base record in her weight class for dead lifting 280 pounds. But, Mr. Fuoco said, she was also kind and tender. After this deployment, she talked about starting a family.",
      "Her roommate and fellow Marine, Sgt. Mallory Harrison, said in a Facebook post that for their generation  stories of combat deaths often felt like something from the past \u2014 tales told by elders about a war that younger Marines had missed. Deployment meant work that was often dull and quiet. Then suddenly combat came ripping back, real and raw.",
      "\u201cThen bad people do bad things, and all of a sudden, the peaceful float you were on turns into you going to Afghanistan & for some, never coming back,\u201d Sergeant Harrison wrote. \u201cIt turns into your friends never coming home. There\u2019s no way to adequately prepare for that feeling. No PowerPoint training, no class from the chaps, nothing. Nothing can prepare you.\u201d",

    "title": "Amid Afghan Chaos, a C.I.A. Mission That Will Persist for Years",
    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 As the Afghanistan war wound down, the C.I.A. had expected to gradually shift its primary focus away from counterterrorism \u2014 a mission that transformed the agency over two decades into a paramilitary organization focused on manhunts and killing \u2014 toward traditional spycraft against powers like China and Russia.",
      "But a pair of deadly explosions on Thursday were the latest in a series of rapidly unfolding events since the collapse of the Afghan government and the Taliban takeover of the country that have upended that plan. Like a black hole with its own gravitational pull, Afghanistan could draw the C.I.A. back into a complex counterterrorism mission for years to come.",
      "American officials are reworking plans to counter threats that could emerge from Afghanistan\u2019s chaos, according to current and former officials: negotiating for new bases in Central Asian countries; determining how clandestine officers can run sources in the country without the military and diplomatic outposts that provided cover to spies for two decades; and figuring out from where the C.I.A. could launch drone strikes and other Afghanistan operations.",
      "Thursday\u2019s attacks at the Kabul airport, which killed more than a dozen U.S. service members and scores of Afghan civilians, were evidence that terrorist groups are already working to sow further chaos in the country and could hope to use it as a base for attacks outside Afghanistan.",
      "Hours later, President Biden pledged to hunt down those responsible for the bombings. \u201cWe will respond with force and precision at our time, at the place we choose and at the moment of our choosing,\u201d he said.",
      "The United States and its allies want to keep Afghanistan from devolving into a terrorist haven akin to Syria a decade ago and Afghanistan before Sept. 11, when the chaos of war lured a hodgepodge of terrorists and new extremist groups were born. The most urgent threat in Afghanistan is the local Islamic State group, American officials said. Leaders of Al Qaeda may also try to return to the country. And while the Taliban may not want either group in Afghanistan, they may be incapable of keeping them out, current and former American officials said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to get a lot harder,\u201d said Don Hepburn, a former senior C.I.A. officer who served in Afghanistan. \u201cThe agency is being drawn in many, many directions.\u201d",
      "Mr. Biden\u2019s determination to end the military\u2019s involvement in Afghanistan means that, starting next month, any American presence in the country would most likely be part of a clandestine operation that is not publicly acknowledged.",
      "The C.I.A.\u2019s new mission will be narrower, a senior intelligence official said. It no will longer have to help protect thousands of troops and diplomats and will focus instead on hunting terrorist groups that can attack beyond Afghanistan\u2019s borders. But the rapid American exit devastated the agency\u2019s networks, and spies will most likely have to rebuild them and manage sources from abroad, according to current and former officials.",
      "The United States will also have to deal with troublesome partners like Pakistan, whose unmatched ability to play both sides of a fight frustrated generations of American leaders.",
      "William J. Burns, the agency\u2019s director, has said that it is ready to collect intelligence and conduct operations from afar, or \u201cover the horizon,\u201d but he told lawmakers in the spring that operatives\u2019 ability to gather intelligence and act on threats will erode. \u201cThat\u2019s simply a fact,\u201d said Mr. Burns, who traveled to Kabul this week for secret talks with the Taliban.",
      "Challenges for the C.I.A. lie ahead in Afghanistan, the senior intelligence official acknowledged, while adding that the agency was not starting from scratch. It had long predicted the collapse of the Afghan government and a Taliban victory, and since at least July had warned that they could come sooner than expected.",
      "In the days after the Sept. 11 attacks, C.I.A. officers were the first to meet with Afghan militia fighters. The agency went on to notch successes in Afghanistan, ruthlessly hunting and killing Qaeda operatives, its primary mission in the country after Sept. 11.",
      "It built a vast network of informants who met their agency handlers in Afghanistan, then used the information to conduct drone strikes against suspected terrorists. The agency prevented Al Qaeda from using Afghanistan as a base to mount a large-scale attack against the United States as it had on Sept. 11.",
      "But that chapter came with a cost in both life and reputation. At least 19 personnel have been killed in Afghanistan \u2014 a death toll eclipsed only by the agency\u2019s losses during the Vietnam War. Several agency paramilitary operatives would later die fighting the Islamic State, a sign of how far afield the original mission had strayed. The last C.I.A. operative to die in Afghanistan was a former elite reconnaissance Marine, killed in a firefight in May 2019, a grim bookend to the conflict.",
      "And one of the agency\u2019s clandestine officers was nearly prosecuted for the 2002 torture death of a detainee at a C.I.A. black site known as the Salt Pit. Raids by C.I.A.-trained Afghan units killed a large number of Afghan civilians, increasing Taliban support in parts of the country.",
      "As the conflict dragged on in Afghanistan, veteran agency officers began to see that the war was lost. One of them was Greg Vogle, a former top agency officer who escorted Hamid Karzai into the country in 2001 and twice ran the C.I.A.\u2019s sprawling station in Kabul in subsequent years. Mr. Vogle has told colleagues that the first time he went into Afghanistan, the United States was winning the war. By the second time, it was a tie. By the third time, he said, the United States was losing.",
      "In recent days during the frantic withdrawal, the C.I.A. has been involved in secret rescue missions, according to a senior American official, who declined to detail the efforts.",
      "The agency expects its mission ahead in Afghanistan will be \u201cmore focused\u201d on tracking the development of terrorist groups determined to attack the United States, the senior U.S. intelligence official said.",
      "The American covert operation in Afghanistan could be carried out by either C.I.A. operatives or Special Operations military troops acting under \u201cTitle 50\u201d authority \u2014 similar to when Navy SEALs killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan on a mission run by the spy agency. Such episodes of putting the military under C.I.A. authority became more common in the post-9/11 era as the lines blurred between soldiers and spies.",
      "But the narrower mission poses its own tests, including recovering from the damage to the C.I.A.\u2019s source networks caused by the abrupt exit from Afghanistan.",
      "Rebuilding America\u2019s information collection will depend in part on electronic eavesdropping and in part on building new networks of human sources, this time from afar, according to former government officials. American officials predicted that Afghan opponents of the Taliban will most likely emerge who will want to help and provide information to the United States.",
      "And without a large American military presence in Afghanistan, any drone strike against an Islamic State or Qaeda target there will have to depart, for now, from the Persian Gulf. Such long flights reduce the amount of time the planes have to hunt targets, increasing the risk of errors and missed targets. Or they could require a large, and expensive, fleet of drones to be used.",
      "The State Department has yet to secure access to bases in Central Asian states that were once part of the Soviet Union, and it is unclear whether that will happen.",
      "Russia has made clear it opposes any American presence in Central Asia. While the former Soviet states sometimes try to balance Moscow\u2019s influence with agreements with the Americans, Russia exerts far more control than it did 20 years ago, when the United States got access to bases in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan during the early parts of the war in Afghanistan.",
      "Afghanistan garnered little attention during Mr. Burns\u2019s confirmation hearings in February. The bulk of questions from both Democrats and Republicans focused on the Biden administration\u2019s plans to shift intelligence resources to the challenge of China, which Mr. Burns identified as a top priority.",
      "Not long afterward, the White House issued an interim national security strategy that put new emphasis on the need to focus on \u201cgreat power\u201d competition with Russia and China. Senior American officials said that priority has not changed, and while Afghanistan has a new urgency, American intelligence agencies can handle multiple priorities at once.",
      "But history shows that such multitasking can be difficult, and that there are opportunity costs. When the military and the C.I.A. focused on the war in Iraq, Afghanistan suffered from inattention. A new, more adversarial government in China emerged as the United States obsessed over the return of Russian aggression in Europe and the rise of the Islamic State.",
      "\u201cThe front burner is crowded,\u201d said John E. McLaughlin, a former acting director of the C.I.A. \u201cThe future holds a mix of challenges. Inevitably, we\u2019re in a world now where China, Russia, countries have that magnitude and influence are going to be in the forefront, but you know lurking in the background, there\u2019s the possibility of terrorists regrouping.\u201d",
      "The potential for Afghanistan to evolve into a hub for terrorist networks also carries its own political risks for the president.",
      "Any terrorist attack originating from Afghanistan would expose Mr. Biden to fierce criticism from his political opponents that it was a result of his decision to pull American troops from the country \u2014 yet another factor that is likely to bring intense White House pressure on spy agencies to keep a laser focus on Afghanistan."

    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Millions of Americans around the country face the prospect of losing their homes after the Supreme Court on Thursday rejected the Biden administration\u2019s latest federal moratorium on evictions, a decision that poses a new and unwelcome problem for a White House already grappling with domestic and international challenges.",
      "The court\u2019s ruling has once again thrust President Biden into the middle of a fight to help prevent people from being evicted as the Delta variant of the coronavirus surges and as Democrats remain unable to muster enough votes to pass a new ban on evictions.",
      "Absent legislation, there are few easy fixes. The administration is struggling to speed the flow of billions of dollars in federal funding to people who are behind in rent because of economic hardship associated with the pandemic.",
      "The scramble to find a solution follows the eight-page majority opinion the Supreme Court issued Thursday evening that said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had exceeded its authority in acting to prevent landlords from evicting tenants during a public health crisis.",
      "No one knows exactly how many tenants are in jeopardy, but the Census Bureau reported this week that more than one million people were very likely to face eviction for nonpayment of rent over the next two months, with millions more behind on rent and in arrears.",
      "With no legal avenues remaining to take action on its own, the Biden administration issued a plea to state and local officials on Friday to do more to help.",
      "In a letter, top cabinet members urged governors, mayors, county executives and judges and administrators to extend local eviction moratoriums. The letter, from Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen; Marcia L. Fudge, the secretary of housing and urban development; and Attorney General Merrick B. Garland; also asked them to enact policies that would require landlords to apply for federal aid before enforcing evictions and recommended that evictions be delayed while rental aid applications were pending.",
      "The troubles facing the Biden administration\u2019s $46.5 billion emergency rental assistance program were clear this week, when Treasury Department figures showed that 89 percent of the money had yet to be distributed by state and local governments. Just $1.7 billion made it to tenants or landlords in July, as states and cities continue to grapple with how to streamline the application processes.",
      "White House officials acknowledge that the money is not being distributed quickly enough, but point out that not all of it was expected to be deployed by now and contend that critics are overlooking the effect the program has had by exaggerating its slow start.",
      "With the court\u2019s decision looming, the Treasury Department rolled out changes to the program on Wednesday, including additional attempts to absolve local governments of federal punishment if they provided money to those who do not actually need help. The agency issued a directive to local officials that they allow tenants to use self-reported financial information on aid applications as a first, rather than a last, resort, while giving states permission to send bulk payments to landlords and utility companies in anticipation of federal payouts to tenants.",
      "The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling divided lawmakers along party lines on Friday, with Republicans applauding the decision and Democrats demanding legislative action to address a looming eviction crisis.",
      "A group of progressive House Democrats wrote a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, calling on congressional leaders to include an extended moratorium that would last through the end of the pandemic in upcoming legislation. An effort by House Democrats to extend the eviction ban failed in July.",
      "Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said on Friday that Mr. Biden would welcome congressional action. Barring that, she said the White House was focused on finding other ways to ease the burden on renters by encouraging the delay of evictions and getting financial assistance out the door more quickly.",
      "A senior White House official said there were no long-shot measures that the administration was waiting to deploy. It will continue to see if agencies like HUD can do more to stall evictions and it will accelerate efforts to get states to pump out relief money faster.",
      "The wave of evictions is coming at a fragile juncture for the economic recovery and as the fiscal support that Congress approved during the initial stages of the pandemic is winding down.",
      "The effect on tenants will \u201cvary tremendously from state to state and city to city,\u201d said Diane Yentel, the president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.",
      "In some states, like California, New Jersey and Virginia, tenants will be temporarily allowed to remain in their homes thanks to statewide protections.",
      "In a statement on Friday, Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York derided the Supreme Court\u2019s decision as \u201cappalling and insensitive.\u201d The state is considering calling a special session of the State Legislature to protect residents from eviction.",
      "But in other states, especially where evictions have already been progressing through the courts, people could lose their homes swiftly.",
      "The eviction process can take anywhere from a matter of days in some states to weeks or months in others. But Ms. Yentel said she expected that many tenants would leave their homes before undergoing a formal eviction process, in an effort to avoid landing an eviction on their record, which would make it harder to find housing in the future.",
      "For tenants in many states, it has been clear for months that they are on their own.",
      "Judges in Texas have been serving evictions since March, when the state Supreme Court refused to extend an order that gave judges the authority to enforce the C.D.C. moratorium. After a Federal District Court in Tennessee found that the moratorium was unlawful in July, judges in parts of Tennessee and Ohio have allowed eviction proceedings to continue as normal.",
      "Elsewhere, landlords have been able to skirt the moratorium by citing reasons other than nonpayment of rent as justification for eviction.",
      "The struggle to get assistance to tenants is in many ways just an illustration of a fact that has been true for several decades: The United States has never had or tried to build a nation-level system to keep its citizens secure in their homes. Now it is trying to establish one on the fly, during a pandemic, with predictable results.",
      "While rental aid is now flowing much faster \u2014 since June, California has more than quadrupled its pace of payments \u2014 many of the country\u2019s most vulnerable tenants live in informal housing arrangements like illegal garage conversions or packed apartments with one leaseholder, making it difficult for aid programs that often require lease agreements to reach.",
      "Across the country, the news of the moratorium ending filled struggling tenants with fear.",
      "Brian Fitzpatrick, 59, fell behind on the monthly rent of $550 for his one-bedroom apartment in St. Louis after his unemployment benefits expired and he was unable to return to work after a fall left him with broken ribs.",
      "He applied for rental assistance but said he had yet to receive a response.",
      "\u201cYou could be sitting here thinking everything is good and then you got the sheriff at the door talking about \u2018you got to get out,\u2019\u201d he said."

      "There is a black and white picture of him and his mother beaming at each other. Then there is a gilt-framed picture of the mobster with his arm around his only child, Albert Francis, both of them nattily dressed in fedoras and crisp suit jackets.",
      "Keep scrolling through the possessions for sale on the Witherell\u2019s Auction House website, however, and more sinister items appear, reminding potential buyers that while Capone might have been known as Papa to his grandchildren, he was also a violent mob boss, the man believed to have ordered the St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre, in which seven men were killed in a Chicago garage by gangsters posing as police officers.",
      "The collection, called \u201cA Century of Notoriety: The Estate of Al Capone,\u201d also features several of his firearms, including a 1911 Colt .45 pistol, described as Capone\u2019s favorite. Live bidding won\u2019t open until Oct. 8, but there are already two six-figure offers for the Colt, said Brian Witherell, founder of Witherell\u2019s.",
      "It is a sign of the continued fascination with a mobster who has been dead for more than 70 years.",
      "\u201cThis is going to be a big one,\u201d Mr. Witherell said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been at this long enough to know what gets traction, but this is exceeding our highest expectations.\u201d",
      "Capone, known as Scarface, died of complications from a stroke and pneumonia in January 1947 in his villa in Palm Island, Fla. He was 48.",
      "His possessions remained in the family and eventually went to the four daughters of Albert Francis Capone, who was known as Sonny.",
      "One of the daughters, Diane Capone, said she and her two surviving sisters, who all live in and around Auburn, Calif., had decided to sell the possessions because they were growing older and because they feared what might happen to the items if the wildfires that have recently torn through Northern California forced them to flee quickly.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve spent the last two summers with our suitcases by the door,\u201d Ms. Capone said.",
      "The items, 174 in total, also include furniture, watches, a white-gold matchbook cover that Capone used to store matchsticks for his cigars, and a letter he wrote to Sonny Capone from prison. Also for sale are pieces of Capone\u2019s jewelry, including diamond stick pins and a flamboyant tie bar with the word \u201cAL\u201d encrusted in diamonds.",
      "Ms. Capone, 77, said she realized that \u201cthere is a tremendous chasm\u201d between her grandfather\u2019s private life and his public life, which has been detailed in newspapers, movies and books.",
      "\u201cDo I know that he was responsible for a lot of bad things, or ordering his people to do bad things?\u201d she said. \u201cYes, of course. But I\u2019m also aware of the fact that the man had multidimensional characteristics. He was able to compartmentalize his public life from the life he led as a family man.\u201d\n\nMs. Capone was 3 when her grandfather died, but she said she had clear memories of him reading to her, holding her in his lap and guiding her through the gardens of the villa, pointing out flowers and figurines as she clutched his fingers.",
      "\u201cHe was very, very affectionate,\u201d she said.",
      "Capone, the son of Italian immigrants, grew up in Brooklyn and was inspired to become a gangster as a teenager, according to a biography by Deirdre Bair. He was a shoe shiner who observed mobsters shaking down local merchants and decided to start his own gang.",
      "As an adult, he built his empire selling liquor during the Prohibition era, the period between 1920 and 1933 when alcoholic beverages were outlawed in the United States.",
      "He made about $100 million a year, according to researchers at Harvard Business School, who said his strategies reflected the \u201cdestructive forms of American entrepreneurship in the early 20th century.\u201d",
      "Capone is believed to have been behind more than 200 deaths, including the death of a prosecutor. The culmination of the gang wars in Chicago between Capone and his chief rival, George Moran, also known as Bugs, occurred on Feb. 14, 1929. Seven men, most of them part of Moran\u2019s gang, were inside a garage when four men burst in and announced a raid. They ordered the men to line up against the wall and shot them.",
      "Capone, who was vacationing in Florida, was not arrested, and some have expressed doubts that it was Capone who ordered the hit. He was never convicted of murder but was sentenced in 1931 for tax evasion and served seven and a half years in federal prison.",
      "During his incarceration, he deteriorated significantly because of paresis, a partial paralysis resulting from syphilis, according to the F.B.I.",
      "When he was released, he was admitted to a hospital in Baltimore and then went to his estate on Palm Island. \u201cHe had become mentally incapable of returning to gangland politics,\u201d the F.B.I. said.",
      "Ms. Capone said she doubted that theory and believed that her grandfather had been content to leave his former life behind him.",
      "She said her grandmother had once described how former associates came to visit Capone after he had returned from prison. When they left, Capone\u2019s wife heard them say, \u201cHe\u2019s crazy as a bedbug,\u201d Ms. Capone said.",
      "\u201cMy grandmother mentioned this to my grandfather, and Papa\u2019s quote was: \u2018Let them think what they want; it\u2019s my ticket out,\u2019\u201d Ms. Capone said.",
      "Sonny Capone eventually dropped the Capone name and moved to California. All of his daughters pursued careers in business or education, married and had children, dropping the Capone name in favor of their husbands\u2019 last names.",

      "Ms. Capone said she had gone back to her maiden name when she published a book about her grandfather based on the memories of his widow, Mae Capone.",
      "She said she planned to give part of her proceeds from the auction to charities, like the local food bank. It was the type of charity her grandfather, who sponsored soup kitchens during the Great Depression, supported.",
      "Ms. Capone said the dichotomy would always mystify her.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have a clue how a person would be capable to live the public life that he did and be the family man that he was,\u201d she said."

      "He was charged with \u201chindering police,\u201d and the congressman in his district in South Carolina piled on with a statement of his own, describing Mr. Price as a \u201csuspect\u201d who \u201crolls up and starts interfering with things.\u201d",
      "Fifteen days later, after Mr. Price spent about 36 hours in jail, the truth came out. Body camera videos of the June 23 incident showed that Mr. Price had been calmly following the instructions of officers in the seconds before one officer, Jonathan Moreno, pushed him against a kerosene tank outside a gas station and took him to the ground.",
      "\u201cHe had done nothing wrong,\u201d Kevin Brackett, the region\u2019s top prosecutor, acknowledged during a news conference last month. Mr. Brackett announced that he was charging Mr. Moreno, who was fired from the Police Department, with assault and battery. And in a dramatic moment, Mr. Brackett called Mr. Moreno to the podium, where he apologized.",

      "There have long been instances in which the police have provided false accounts of arrests, but disparities between officers\u2019 descriptions and what people see have become more common with the expansion of body cameras and cellphone videos and as police departments\u2019 public accounts draw more scrutiny.",
      "The Minneapolis Police Department\u2019s initial description of George Floyd\u2019s death, in May 2020, said he had died after a \u201cmedical incident during police interaction.\u201d That account was challenged within hours as a teenager\u2019s gruesome video of his death flooded the internet, igniting the largest protests in a generation.",
      "Across the United States, people who have been the targets of false police statements are increasingly working to correct the record, sometimes investigating their own cases, interviewing witnesses and filing defamation lawsuits.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a widespread search for tools to make the police more accountable,\u201d said Lyrissa Lidsky, the dean of the University of Missouri School of Law and an expert in defamation law. \u201cThese lawsuits are part and parcel of the search for police accountability tools.\u201d",

      "In Central Florida, Chris Cordero was driving his tan Saturn through his neighborhood in Lake Wales early this year when, he said, he noticed a police cruiser following him. Mr. Cordero, 37, grew nervous, and then the officer pulled him over. What could have been a routine traffic stop ended with Mr. Cordero on the ground, in handcuffs. He would face several years in prison, accused of assaulting a police officer.",
      "In his report, the officer, David Colt Black, said he had pulled Mr. Cordero over because he was not wearing a seatbelt and had ignored a stop sign. The officer said Mr. Cordero got out of his car and immediately charged at him.",
      "\u201cCordero continued approaching me with closed fists, yelling, \u2018You can\u2019t stop me, you don\u2019t have the right,\u2019\u201d the officer wrote, adding: \u201cCordero continued to charge towards me with closed fists.\u201d",
      "He said Mr. Cordero kept resisting arrest and seemed to be reaching for a weapon in his waistband, and so he used his elbow to deliver a swift strike to the side of Mr. Cordero\u2019s head. Mr. Cordero was arrested and taken into custody.",

      "Mr. Cordero\u2019s door-knocking produced quick results. He obtained a doorbell security video from the house across the street. The footage was from a bit of a distance, and it was hardly clear what was happening, but it was obvious that Mr. Cordero had not done what he had been accused of.",
      "Video in hand, he started making phone calls, accusing the officers of brutality and of making racist slurs. Within a day, Officer Black submitted a supplemental report saying that he realized, after watching the surveillance footage, that his \u201cperception was altered due to the high stress of the incident.\u201d",

After the revelations in Mr. Cordero\u2019s case, Officer Black resigned from the department and began treatment, according to an investigative report by the Polk County Sheriff\u2019s Office. Investigators closed the case with no action, and the prosecutors did not charge the officer.",

      "Here is a rundown of where things stand:",

      "Oregon, California, Washington State, Hawaii, Illinois and New Jersey will require vaccines for teachers, though the rules will vary. All have Democratic governors. The three largest districts in the country \u2014 New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago \u2014 also have vaccine mandates.",
      "At least 15 Republican-led states have banned vaccine mandates, according to N.A.S.H.P., although the F.D.A.\u2019s full approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine could render some of that legislation moot.",

Overall, wearing a mask all day and maintaining social distance hasn\u2019t hampered her enjoying school, having fun learning and making new friends, thanks to the amazing teachers and administrators. \u2014 Nidal, 42, Atlanta",
      "Frustrations",
      "In Florida, we haven\u2019t been given a choice like last year when we kept all three of our kids home 100 percent of the time. The classes are the same size. There are no mask mandates: Teachers, principals and office staff don\u2019t even pretend to mask anymore. They have the children sitting with roughly five students per table. We have no options. We are terrified for them. \u2014 Kayte Bush, 43, Dunedin, Fla. Her oldest son is vaccinated, but her 11-year-old twins are not yet eligible.",

      "That my kids will lose their friends. Last year, even with mask requirements, I noticed some sidelong looks from their friends whose parents often promote anti-masking.

      "A Florida court on Friday rejected an effort by Gov. Ron DeSantis and other state officials to prevent mask mandates in schools during the state\u2019s worst Covid-19 outbreak yet.",
      "Judge John C. Cooper of the state\u2019s Second Judicial Circuit said that Florida\u2019s school districts may impose strict mask mandates on students to curb the spread of the coronavirus, handing a defeat to Governor DeSantis, whose administration has vehemently insisted on leaving masking decisions to children\u2019s parents.",
      "In a lengthy ruling from the bench, Judge Cooper sided with parents of students in various school districts who had argued that Florida\u2019s Constitution requires keeping schoolchildren safe and secure, and masks would help accomplish that in a pandemic. Florida had previously indicated that it would appeal any adverse ruling to a more conservative appellate court.",
      "Lawyers for Mr. DeSantis, a Republican, and the Florida Department of Education had countered that a \u201cparents\u2019 bill of rights\u201d enacted by state lawmakers earlier this year gave parents the right to decide if their child should wear a mask. Judge Cooper disagreed, saying the new law \u201cdoesn\u2019t ban mask mandates\u201d and in fact gives school districts the discretion to impose them.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a parent \u2014 parents\u2019 rights are very important,\u201d Judge Cooper said. \u201cBut they\u2019re not without some reasonable limitation, depending upon safety, reasonableness and a compelling state need.\u201d",
      "In a statement, the Department of Education said it would appeal.",
      "\u201cWe are immensely disappointed that the ruling issued today by the Second Judicial Circuit discards the rule of law,\u201d said Jared M. Ochs, a spokesman. \u201cThis decision conflicts with basic and established rights of parents to make private health care and education decisions for children.\u201d",
      "The ruling, delivered over nearly two hours on Friday, came after a high-profile trial was held via Zoom over the course of four days this week. At one point, more than 2,000 people watched Judge Cooper deliver his ruling in a livestream on YouTube.",
      "Judge Cooper granted an injunction against the Department of Education \u2014 but not the governor \u2014 blocking it from punishing local school boards. Florida had threatened to withhold funding from two school districts, Alachua and Broward, which were the first to impose strict mask mandates, in an amount equal to school board members\u2019 monthly salaries.",
      "Other Republican governors who have banned school mask mandates, including Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas and Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona, are also facing legal challenges.",
      "Florida is experiencing its worst moment of the pandemic after a brutal summer surge fueled by the Delta variant that has left more people testing positive for, hospitalized with and dying from the virus than ever before. More children in the state are hospitalized with Covid-19 than at any other point. This week in Orange County, where Orlando is, children between the ages of 5 and 14 made up about 20 percent of new virus cases.",
      "Classes have started over the past few weeks, prompting 10 of the state\u2019s 67 countywide school districts, covering about half of the state\u2019s 2.8 million students, to defy the state and require masks with limited medical exemptions. Other districts made masks voluntary or allowed parents to opt out for any reason.",
      "Florida has allowed parents to apply for private school vouchers if they consider mask mandates to be \u201charassment\u201d of their children."

      "TAYLORSVILLE, Calif. \u2014 In the six long weeks since the Dixie fire, the second-largest blaze on record in California, erupted in the northern Sierra Nevada, the fire has scorched vast tracts of forest, incinerated gold-rush towns, and upended thousands of lives, forcing people across 1,000 square miles to flee their homes.",
      "Through it all, the scattered residents of the area around Greenville, a town of about 1,000 that was all but destroyed early this month, have been able to count on one thing, at least: the raspy, reassuring voice of Daniel Kearns helping them to make sense of what is going on back home.",
      "Mr. Kearns, a volunteer firefighter from nearby Taylorsville, posts daily live videos online that explain the latest fire activity maps \u2014 which at a glance might look as though the fire had swallowed the place whole \u2014 and that show that reality on the ground, though very, very smoky, is a little less terrifying than it might appear from afar.",
      "\u201cOnly through all this can I hear that the fire is around our family home and feel calm about it,\u201d Michaela Garcia wrote about Mr. Kearns\u2019s videos this week from Chico. \u201cThank you, Dan, we are truly so lucky.\u201d",
      "A former Marine, Mr. Kearns, 39, can project calm even when the mountain behind him is on fire and pouring smoke \u2014 as it was this week while the fire menaced Taylorsville \u2014 or when it is approaching places he knows well. \u201cMy mom\u2019s,\u201d he said recently, pointing at the map.",
      "He began posting the daily live videos on his personal Facebook page in late July, about two weeks after the Dixie fire erupted, because he saw misinformation spreading online about towns being destroyed in the Indian Valley, which is surrounded by densely forested mountains. \u201cI could tell it was really upsetting people,\u201d he said.",
      "The audience for the videos surged after Greenville burned down on Aug. 4 and more of the area was evacuated in the following weeks. Even as he assisted fire crews fending off the flames, Mr. Kearns gathered information for his videos by touring the valley in his fire engine, and meeting regularly with Forest Service personnel.",
      "Many local residents felt that the fire authorities\u2019 own briefings were superficial or that they painted a misleadingly cheery picture of events on the ground, said Travis Rubke, a retired science teacher who had to evacuate from Greenville. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have a local,\u201d Mr. Rubke said. \u201cPeople say, \u2018You\u2019ve got to tune in to Dan.\u2019\u201d",
      "The Lookout, a website run by Zeke Lunder, a forestry and fire expert whose heat maps and analysis are also widely followed by people in the fire\u2019s path, has referred to him as \u201cvolunteer community PIO/hero Daniel Kearns.\u201d And his videos now get as many as 3,000 views a day from people as far away as New Mexico and New Zealand.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve found that the truth, no matter how painful and ugly it is, calms people down,\u201d Mr. Kearns said, in an interview. \u201cAnd this is a very important time for people to be calm.\u201d",
      "There is more to his appeal, though, than just the latest facts. Mr. Kearns personalizes his videos with off-the-cuff remarks, passionate critiques of federal forest management policies and soulful reflections on \u201cthe trauma on our land and people.\u201d",
      "He closes each video by taking off his cap, closing his eyes and calling for \u201ca moment of silence for our natural relations\u201d \u2014 the burning forests and the bears, foxes, deer and other wildlife that live in them.",
      "Those moments \u2014 like the videos themselves \u2014 have provided a daily ritual for people flung far from their homes and neighbors, and a mantra for those still in the valley who are trying to keep the flames away from cattle ranches and sacred Native American ground.",
      "Mr. Kearns says he hopes to remain a voice of calm and a source of accurate information as long as the fire persists. But he often reminds his audience, \u201cI\u2019m just a guy.\u201d",
      "And if higher-ups don\u2019t like his videos, he says, the worst they can do is take away his cap."

    "title": "What Went Wrong With the Pandemic in Florida",
    "content": [
      "MIAMI \u2014 The unexpected and unwelcome coronavirus surge now unfolding in the United States has hit hardest in states that were slow to embrace vaccines. And then there is Florida.",
      "While leaders in that state also refused lockdowns and mask orders, they made it a priority to vaccinate vulnerable older people. Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, opened mass vaccination sites and sent teams to retirement communities and nursing homes. Younger people also lined up for shots.",
      "Mr. DeSantis and public health experts expected a rise in cases this summer as people gathered indoors in the air-conditioning. But what happened was much worse: Cases spiraled out of control, reaching peaks higher than Florida had seen before. Hospitalizations followed. So did deaths, which are considerably higher than the numbers currently reached anywhere else in the country.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very sad, sad moment for all of us,\u201d said Natalie E. Dean, a biostatistician at Emory University who until recently worked at the University of Florida and has closely followed the pandemic in the state. \u201cIt was really hard to imagine us ever getting back to this place.\u201d",
      "The Florida story is a cautionary tale for dealing with the current incarnation of the coronavirus. The United States has used the vaccines as its primary pandemic weapon. But Florida shows that even a state that made a major push for vaccinations \u2014 Florida ranks 21st among states and Washington, D.C., in giving people of all ages at least one shot \u2014 can be crushed by the Delta variant, reaching frightening levels of hospitalizations and deaths.",
      "\u201cClearly the vaccines are keeping most of these people out of the hospital, but we\u2019re not building the herd immunity that people hoped,\u201d Mr. DeSantis said at a news conference this past week. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a huge percentage of people \u2014 adults \u2014 that have gotten shots, and yet you\u2019ve still seen a wave.\u201d",
      "Morgues and crematories are full or getting there. Public utilities in Orlando and Tampa have asked residents to cut back on water usage so liquid oxygen, which is used in water treatment, can be conserved for hospitals. As of Friday, Florida was recording an average of 242 virus deaths a day, nearly as many as California and Texas combined, though a few states still had a higher per capita rate, according to public health data tracked by The New York Times.",
      "Florida\u2019s pandemic data, more scant since the state ended its declared Covid-19 state of emergency in June, reveals only limited information about who is dying. Hospitals have said upward of 90 percent of their patients have been unvaccinated. Exactly why the state has been so hard-hit remains an elusive question. Other states with comparable vaccine coverage have a small fraction of Florida\u2019s hospitalization rate.",
      "The best explanation of what has happened is that Florida\u2019s vaccination rates were good, but not good enough for its demographics. It has so many older people that even vaccinating a vast majority of them left more than 800,000 unprotected. Vaccination rates among younger people were uneven, so clusters of people remained at risk. Previous virus waves, which were milder than in some other states, conferred only some natural immunity.",
      "And Florida is Florida: People have enjoyed many months of barhopping, party-going and traveling, all activities conducive to swift virus spread.",
      "Unlike in places like Oregon, which is clamping down again, adopting even outdoor mask mandates, Mr. DeSantis continues to stay the course, hoping to power through despite the devastating human toll. A Quinnipiac University poll released this past week found that Mr. DeSantis\u2019s approval rating was 47 percent.",
      "He and other state officials have sought to steer away from measures that could curtail infections, banning strict mask mandates in public schools. The biggest school districts imposed them anyway, and on Friday, a state judge ruled that Florida could not prevent those mandates, a decision the Department of Education plans to appeal.",
      "Florida has experienced more deaths than normal \u2014 from all causes, not just Covid-19 \u2014 throughout the pandemic. In the early weeks of 2021, with cases surging and the vaccine rollout kicking off, the state averaged 5,600 deaths each week, about a third more than typical for that time of year, according to mortality figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The deaths dropped and then went back up.",
      "These excess deaths are important, both because a number of Covid-19 deaths occur outside hospitals, and because the virus may contribute to deaths from other causes as a result of the strain on the health system.",
      "In the first week of August, the state recorded another 5,600 deaths. But because mortality rates normally drop during summer months, the figure was more than 50 percent above what\u2019s typical.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a ton of people calling us to report the Covid deaths,\u201d said Dr. Stephen J. Nelson, the Polk County medical examiner. \u201cThey\u2019re typically young people that have been sick for a while.\u201d",
      "The picture of who is dying, however, is complicated.",
      "About 82 percent of people 65 and older in the state are fully vaccinated, about average for the nation. That has still left a relatively large number of older people \u2014 about 819,000 \u2014 unvaccinated or only partially vaccinated, said Jason L. Salemi, an epidemiologist at the University of South Florida. If the unvaccinated also take fewer other precautions, he added, that would put them directly in the virus\u2019s path.",
      "\u201cThe Delta variant is exceptional at finding vulnerable populations,\u201d he said.",
      "The situation in nursing homes, where infections can spread swiftly, has also been problematic. While vaccination rates among older Floridians as a whole have been good, the rate of nursing home residents who are fully vaccinated \u2014 an average of 73.1 percent in each home \u2014 is lower than every state but Nevada, according to the C.D.C. About 47.5 percent of nursing home staff members were fully vaccinated as of Aug. 15, the lowest of any state but Louisiana.",
      "Older people are also more likely to have immune deficiencies and comorbidities, making them more susceptible to breakthrough infections and hospitalizations, noted Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious-disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco. And some, though not all, data have suggested that immunity against infection has waned in older, vaccinated adults; the Biden administration has indicated that those people will be among the first in line for booster shots.",
      "Then there are the younger people, who now make up a larger share of Florida virus deaths. Before June 25, people under 65 made up 22 percent of deaths. Since then, that proportion has risen to 28 percent.",
      "Fifty-six percent of people between the ages of 12 and 64 in Florida\u2019s 10 largest counties are fully vaccinated, which is consistent with national figures. But in the rest of the state, that figure is only 43 percent, and in 27 counties, less than 1 in 3 residents in the age group is fully vaccinated.",
      "The heart-wrenching deaths of children remain rare. The deaths of young and middle-aged adults have become routine.",
      "\u201cMy mom had no prior illnesses \u2014 she was strong as an ox,\u201d said Tr\u00e9 Burrows, whose 50-year-old mother, Cindy Dawkins, died from Covid-19 on Aug. 7. \u201cThere was literally nothing wrong with her. This just came out of nowhere.\u201d",
      "Ms. Dawkins, a mother of four who worked in a restaurant in Boynton Beach, began to feel ill shortly before her birthday, as the family was en route to celebrate in Orlando. Ms. Dawkins developed a cough and shortness of breath. Four days later, she went to a hospital. Doctors placed her on a ventilator. Thirty-two hours later, she was dead.",
      "Her son said she had not gotten vaccinated because she feared possible side effects.",
      "Those who did not get vaccinated are only part of the explanation behind the surge. Many states slammed by the virus earlier developed deep reservoirs of natural immunity from prior infections, affording them higher levels of protection than would be evident from vaccination rates alone.",
      "Not so in Florida. Compared to other states, Florida was spared as devastating a wintertime wave of cases as ravaged other parts of the country \u2014 in part because warm weather made it possible for people to gather outdoors. That was a boon to Florida\u2019s economy and its political leaders but a liability come summertime, when the state was unable to rely on the same wall of natural immunity that is now helping to shield places walloped by the virus this winter.",
      "\u201cPeople have underestimated the role of natural immunity,\u201d Dr. Chin-Hong said. \u201cWherever you get hit hard, you kind of get a reprieve from the virus.\u201d",
      "There is some question as to whether Florida\u2019s vaccination rates, especially in places like Miami and Orlando, might have been inflated by tourists getting shots. Regardless, vaccinations appear to be making Covid-19 cases less severe in Miami-Dade County, which had one of the state\u2019s highest vaccination rates, according to research by Dr. Jeffrey Harris, a physician and emeritus professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",
      "Beyond that, the hot weather has driven people indoors and attracted hordes of vacationers, creating the conditions for Delta to spread. For all of the focus on vaccines, scientists said, the virus\u2019s path remains highly dependent on how closely people are packed together, where people are congregating and what precautions they are taking.",
      "For other states whose residents will head indoors as temperatures drop in the fall and winter, Florida offers an important lesson, Dr. Dean said: As in the beginning of the pandemic, hospitalizations need to be kept in check.",
      "\u201cThe minimum thing we should be achieving is to keep those hospitalization numbers low so it\u2019s not straining the health care system, because that doesn\u2019t just affect Covid patients \u2014 it affects everyone,\u201d she said.",
      "And policymakers, she said, must realize that vaccination rates need to be higher than previously thought to control a more contagious virus variant.",
      "\u201cThings can get out of hand,\u201d she said. \u201cI do believe that this could happen in other states, too.\u201d"

      "\u201cI know that day I saved countless lives,\u201d Lieutenant Byrd told NBC Nightly News, publicly identifying himself for the first time. \u201cI know members of Congress, as well as my fellow officers and staff, were in jeopardy and in serious danger. And that\u2019s my job.\u201d",
      "The Capitol Police and federal prosecutors had kept his identity private, saying that he and his family had received death threats. Former President Donald J. Trump and far-right Republicans have portrayed the rioter he shot, Ashli Babbitt, as a martyr and suggested without evidence that she was a victim of premeditated murder.",
      "Lieutenant Byrd organized and coordinated the defense of the House chamber on Jan. 6, when a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol and beat police officers while Congress counted electoral votes to formalize President Biden\u2019s victory.",
      "A 28-year veteran of the Capitol Police force, Lieutenant Byrd said he had never fired his gun before Jan. 6. He argued that had been his only option as rioters smashed through the glass doors of the Speaker\u2019s Lobby, ignoring orders to stay back and threatening lawmakers who were gathered only feet away.",
      "\u201cI tried to wait as long as I could,\u201d he said. \u201cI hoped and prayed no one tried to enter through those doors. But their failure to comply required me to take the appropriate action to save the lives of members of Congress and myself and my fellow officers.\u201d",
      "The Capitol Police announced on Monday that their investigation into the shooting had found that the officer acted lawfully and potentially saved lawmakers and aides from serious harm or death.",
      "That decision came after a Justice Department finding in April that charges against the officer were not warranted in the shooting of Ms. Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran. She was among a throng of Trump supporters who smashed their way through the entrance to the Speaker\u2019s Lobby, a restricted area immediately outside the House chamber, while officers were evacuating lawmakers.",
      "According to video of the encounter, as rioters shattered the lobby doors, Ms. Babbitt tried to climb through a hole in the glass. A person on the other side fired a single shot, causing her to fall back and pushing the intruders back. The bullet hit her in the left shoulder, and she was taken to a hospital, where she died. She was one of five people who lost their lives during the Capitol assault and its immediate aftermath.",

    "title": "Biden Floats Faster Access to Booster Shots Amid Spread of Variant",
    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Biden suggested on Friday that the government could offer coronavirus vaccine booster shots to most vaccinated adults sooner than eight months after a second shot, underscoring the administration\u2019s concerns about the spread of the Delta variant.",
      "Mr. Biden\u2019s comments came during an Oval Office meeting with Prime Minister Naftali Bennett of Israel, whose government has already given booster shots to about a third of its population. Just nine days earlier, the president announced that his administration would begin offering third shots the week of Sept. 20 to adults who had received their second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines at least eight months ago.",
      "But during the meeting with Mr. Bennett, Mr. Biden said his administration was weighing other options as well.",
      "\u201cWe were going to start mid-September, but we\u2019re considering the advice you\u2019ve given that we should start earlier,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cThe question raised is should it be shorter than eight months? Should it be as little as five months? That\u2019s being discussed.\u201d",
      "The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, later played down the significance of Mr. Biden\u2019s comments, saying the administration\u2019s original eight-month proposal was unchanged. She said the president would continue to rely on guidance from federal health experts.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration is racing to collect and analyze data from the vaccine manufacturers, the National Institutes of Health and elsewhere on the safety and efficacy of booster shots. Administration officials are meeting daily to discuss how to administer extra shots to vaccinated Americans.",
      "While senior federal health officials appear to uniformly agree that booster shots are necessary, they and Mr. Biden have said repeatedly that they are contingent upon the F.D.A. determining that they are safe and effective, as well as on a recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to offer them.",
      "But among some outside experts, Mr. Biden\u2019s comments heightened concerns that the White House is pushing a broad plan for booster shots before regulators have had a chance to analyze the data. Dr. Carlos del Rio, an infectious disease specialist at Emory University, said the White House was implicitly putting pressure on the health agencies on whom the public relies for independent judgment.",
      "\u201cWe have very strong science organizations like C.D.C. and F.D.A. They need to make the recommendations,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m frankly very upset that the administration is bypassing those very important scientific bodies that should be making those recommendations.\u201d",
      "Administration officials argue that they need to prepare the public for what lies ahead, even as the F.D.A. and the C.D.C. review the data that will guide whatever course is ultimately taken. At a news briefing this week, Dr. Vivek H. Murthy, the surgeon general, said the administration was striving to \u201cpreserve integrity of process, while still being transparent with the public, while still planning ahead and giving people a sense of what may come.\u201d",
      "If the F.D.A. decides that booster shots are safe and effective, the agency could recommend a minimum waiting period before vaccinated people can get one. The C.D.C.\u2019s advisory board of experts would then meet to consider the F.D.A.\u2019s decision and could advise the C.D.C. that booster shots be given within a period of several months after the second shot. An agency recommendation would follow.",
      "Regardless of the time frame, officials said, the administration will strive to offer booster shots first to those who were inoculated earliest in the vaccination campaign because they are considered the most vulnerable. That would include nursing home residents and health care workers, followed by other older people.",
      "Some health experts have criticized the booster plans as premature, saying the data shows that the vaccines still provide robust protection against severe Covid-19 disease and hospitalization. But administration officials have said that because they see the potency of the vaccines waning against infection, they fear that the bulwark they provide against severe disease may soon weaken.",
      "Federal officials have been closely watching Israel, whose vaccination campaign initially moved more quickly than the American one, and because \u2014 unlike the United States \u2014 it has a robust national surveillance program that tracks infections. Both countries are now awash in infections from the Delta variant.",
      "The Israeli government relied heavily on the Pfizer vaccine for immunizations, and began offering booster shots on Aug. 1. On Tuesday, it expanded the booster campaign to people over the age of 30.",
      "Some data from Israel\u2019s Ministry of Health indicates a slow but steady rise in the rate of severe disease among vaccinated people 55 years or older from roughly late June to early August. That was followed by a tapering off of such cases \u2014 a trend that some analysts suggest shows the impact of booster shots.",
      "At the Oval Office meeting on Friday, Mr. Bennett said Israel had found that a booster shot \u201cis safe and it works.\u201d He added, \u201cThe good news, finally, is that the tide is turning in Israel.\u201d"

    "title": "Justice Breyer on Retirement and the Role of Politics at the Supreme Court",
    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Justice Stephen G. Breyer says he is struggling to decide when to retire from the Supreme Court and is taking account of a host of factors, including who will name his successor. \u201cThere are many things that go into a retirement decision,\u201d he said.",
      "He recalled approvingly something Justice Antonin Scalia had told him.",
      "\u201cHe said, \u2018I don\u2019t want somebody appointed who will just reverse everything I\u2019ve done for the last 25 years,\u2019\u201d Justice Breyer said during a wide-ranging interview on Thursday. \u201cThat will inevitably be in the psychology\u201d of his decision, he said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to stay there till I die \u2014 hope not,\u201d he said.",
      "Justice Breyer, 83, is the oldest member of the court, the senior member of its three-member liberal wing and the subject of an energetic campaign by liberals who want him to step down to ensure that President Biden can name his successor.",
      "The justice tried to sum up the factors that would go into his decision. \u201cThere are a lot of blurred things there, and there are many considerations,\u201d he said. \u201cThey form a whole. I\u2019ll make a decision.\u201d",
      "He paused, then added: \u201cI don\u2019t like making decisions about myself.\u201d",
      "The justice visited the Washington bureau of The New York Times to discuss his new book, \u201cThe Authority of the Court and the Peril of Politics,\u201d scheduled to be published next month by Harvard University Press. It prompted questions about expanding the size of court, the so-called shadow docket and, inevitably, his retirement plans.",
      "The book explores the nature of the court\u2019s authority, saying it is undermined by labeling justices as conservative or liberal. Drawing a distinction between law and politics, Justice Breyer wrote that not all splits on the court were predictable and that those that were could generally be explained by differences in judicial philosophy or interpretive methods.",
      "In the interview, he acknowledged that the politicians who had transformed confirmation hearings into partisan brawls held a different view, but he said the justices acted in good faith, often finding consensus and occasionally surprising the public in significant cases.",
      "\u201cDidn\u2019t one of the most conservative \u2014 quote \u2014 members join with the others in the gay rights case?\u201d he asked in the interview, referring to Justice Neil M. Gorsuch\u2019s majority opinion last year ruling that a landmark civil rights law protects gay and transgender workers from workplace discrimination.",
      "Justice Breyer made the point more broadly in his new book. \u201cMy experience from more than 30 years as a judge has shown me that anyone taking the judicial oath takes it very much to heart,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA judge\u2019s loyalty is to the rule of law, not the political party that helped to secure his or her appointment.\u201d",
      "That may suggest that judges ought not consider the political party of the president under whom they retire, but Justice Breyer seemed to reject that position.",
      "He was asked about a remark from Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who died in 2005, in response to a question about whether it was \u201cinappropriate for a justice to take into account the party or politics of the sitting president when deciding whether to step down from the court.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo, it\u2019s not inappropriate,\u201d the former chief justice responded. \u201cDeciding when to step down from the court is not a judicial act.\u201d",
      "That sounded correct to Justice Breyer. \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d he said.",
      "Progressive groups and many Democrats were furious over Senate Republicans\u2019 failure to give a hearing in 2016 to Judge Merrick B. Garland, President Barack Obama\u2019s third Supreme Court nominee. That anger was compounded by the rushed confirmation last fall of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, President Donald J. Trump\u2019s third nominee, just weeks after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and weeks before Mr. Trump lost his bid for re-election.",
      "Liberals have pressed Mr. Biden to respond with what they say is corresponding hardball: expanding the number of seats on the court to overcome what is now a 6-to-3 conservative majority. Mr. Biden responded by creating a commission to study possible changes to the structure of the court, including enlarging it and imposing term limits on the justices.",
      "Justice Breyer said he was wary of efforts to increase the size of the court, saying it could erode public trust in it by sending the message that the court is at its core a political institution and result in a tit-for-tat race to the bottom.",
      "\u201cThink twice, at least,\u201d he said of the proposal. \u201cIf A can do it, B can do it. And what are you going to have when you have A and B doing it?\u201d",
      "Such a judicial arms race, the justice said, could undercut public faith in the court and imperil the rule of law. \u201cNobody really knows, but there\u2019s a risk, and how big a risk do you want to take?\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWhy do we care about the rule of law?\u201d Justice Breyer added. \u201cBecause the law is one weapon \u2014 not the only weapon \u2014 but one weapon against tyranny, autocracy, irrationality.\u201d",
      "Term limits were another matter, he said.",
      "\u201cIt would have to be a long term, because you don\u2019t want the person there thinking of his next job,\u201d he said.",
      "Term limits would also have a silver lining for justices deciding when to retire, he added. \u201cIt would make my life easier,\u201d he said.",
      "Justice Breyer said the court should be deciding fewer emergency applications on its \u201cshadow docket,\u201d in which the justices often issue consequential rulings based on thin briefing and no oral arguments. Among recent examples were the ruling on Tuesday that the Biden administration could not immediately rescind a Trump-era immigration policy and a ruling issued a few hours after the interview striking down Mr. Biden\u2019s eviction moratorium.",
      "In both, the three liberal justices were in dissent.",
      "Justice Breyer said the court should take its foot off the gas. \u201cI can\u2019t say never decide a shadow-docket thing,\u201d he said. \u201cNot never. But be careful. And I\u2019ve said that in print. I\u2019ll probably say it more.\u201d",
      "Asked whether the court should supply reasoning when it makes such decisions, he said: \u201cCorrect. I agree with you. Correct.\u201d",
      "He was in a characteristically expansive mood, but he was not eager to discuss retirement. Indeed, his publisher had circulated ground rules for the interview, saying he would not respond to questions about his plans. But he seemed at pains to make one thing clear: He is a realist.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve said that there are a lot of considerations,\u201d Justice Breyer said. \u201cI don\u2019t think any member of the court is living in Pluto or something.\u201d"

    "title": "Why House Democrats Face \u2018Mutually Assured Destruction\u2019",
    "content": [
      "Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox on Tuesdays and Thursdays.",
      "The House voted along party lines on Tuesday to start hashing out the details of a $3.5 trillion partisan package to enact huge swaths of President Biden\u2019s economic and social agenda, while setting a deadline of Sept. 27 to act on a $1 trillion bipartisan package for physical infrastructure.",
      "The vote, however, came a day later than expected, after a day of frantic negotiations among Democrats.",
      "Why? Here\u2019s the short answer: As a train carrying the policy agenda and political fate of the Democratic Party chugged by, 10 members of the party\u2019s 220-member House caucus brought it to a screeching halt, let it start up again in exchange for a three-day shift in an unenforceable deadline, and declared victory in \u201cdecoupling\u201d two cars that are still quite clearly coupled.",
      "The longer answer starts with the fragility of the Democratic caucus, which controls Congress by the narrowest of margins and includes an uneasy alliance of progressive and conservative factions, either of which is capable of blowing up the train.",
      "Democrats\u2019 220-212 majority in the House means that, assuming no Republican support \u2014 a safe assumption in most cases \u2014 they can afford as few as three defections on any bill. At least 10 conservative-leaning members are willing to threaten the $3.5 trillion partisan bill. A group of liberals is willing to block the $1 trillion bipartisan bill, far more than the likely handful of Republican votes can make up for.",
      "What party leaders have going for them is that the members who could blow up the partisan budget bill really want to pass the bipartisan infrastructure one, and vice versa. As Representative Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the House majority leader, told the Democratic rank-and-file on Monday, \u201cthis is mutually assured destruction.\u201d",
      "The analogy is apt. In its original, Cold War context, the term \u201cmutually assured destruction\u201d referred to the understanding that the United States and the Soviet Union each possessed enough nuclear weapons to annihilate the other \u2014 and that, therefore, it was in neither country\u2019s best interest to do it, because it would be annihilated, too.",
      "This is not a kingmaker situation in which a small faction capable of tanking legislation extracts concessions in exchange for their votes. That happens all the time. Just look at Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.",
      "What makes the current situation in the House so unusual \u2014 so, well, mutually assuredly destructive \u2014 is that each side has leverage over the other at the same time.",
      "If that remains the case, it\u2019s likely that both bills will pass, securing a sweeping legislative legacy for the Biden administration and the Democratic Party. But if the mutual leverage disappears, the whole enterprise falls apart. To avoid that, Hoyer, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other House leaders settled on the \u201ctwo-track\u201d strategy, in which the bills move forward in tandem, and Biden is on board.",
      "The trouble is, tying the bills together to assure that they both succeed also leaves open the chance that they could both fail, making it possible that, come the end of September, Democrats will end up with something not a single one of them wants: nothing.",
      "After the conservative faction reached its deal with Pelosi on Tuesday, its leader, Representative Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, said in a statement that the Sept. 27 commitment ensured that the $1 trillion bill would \u201creceive stand-alone consideration, fully delinked, and on its own merits.\u201d",
      "But that is demonstrably not true, because Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington, the leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said in her own statement: \u201cAs our members have made clear for three months, the two are integrally tied together, and we will only vote for the infrastructure bill after passing the reconciliation bill.\u201d",
      "The conservative Democrats have suggested that the current arrangement, which requires them to support something close to the $3.5 trillion budget bill if they want their $1 trillion infrastructure bill to pass, amounts to extortion. But there is really nothing they can do about it because they need the progressives as much as the progressives need them.",
      "Pelosi promised a vote on the $1 trillion package by Sept. 27, and she promised to rally Democratic support for its passage. She didn\u2019t, and couldn\u2019t, promise to succeed.",
      "Which means the new deadline changes very little."

      "DETROIT \u2014 Once again, the Census Bureau reported, Detroit has gotten smaller.",
      "For most Detroiters\u2019 entire lives, census day has brought only bad news, a painful once-a-decade accounting of an exodus that has shrunk their city\u2019s population by more than half since 1950 and left entire blocks abandoned.",
      "Mayor Mike Duggan pledged to stop that decline when he swept into office eight years ago, telling voters they could measure his success based on whether residents returned. But when the latest numbers were released this month, they showed the population had fallen more than 10 percent since 2010, to about 639,000 residents.",
      "In the ledger of the federal government, Mr. Duggan had failed to meet his goal, people were still leaving and Detroit now had fewer residents than Oklahoma City. In the mayor\u2019s own view, he was succeeding, the city was coming back and the Census Bureau had just counted wrong.",
      "Hours after the census count was released, the mayor fired off an indignant statement accusing the bureau of undercounting Detroit residents by at least 10 percent. Mr. Duggan said municipal utility data backed up his claims, but his office declined to provide localized evidence to prove that. Census officials mostly declined to discuss the mayor\u2019s complaints.",
      "The unusual squabble between City Hall and the Census Bureau was only the latest sign that, under Mr. Duggan, Detroit has become America\u2019s ultimate Rorschach test. Does your attention go to the many challenges that persist \u2014 the crime, the trash piles, the people struggling to pay rent, and, yes, the census tally? Or do your eyes focus on what has clearly improved during the mayor\u2019s tenure \u2014 the livelier downtown, the clean lots where blighted houses once stood, the N.B.A.'s Pistons moving back from the suburbs, the new Jeep factory?",
      "\u201cPeople in Detroit know the difference,\u201d said Mr. Duggan, a Democrat who is seeking a third term and who finished far ahead of his challengers in this month\u2019s primary election. \u201cIf you came in from the outside, you would not go around saying how good this looks.\u201d",
      "On the west side, where well-kept homes are situated next to others with busted windows or fire-scorched frames, Cynthia A. Johnson, a state representative, said her district \u201chasn\u2019t changed a whole hell of a lot\u201d since Mr. Duggan took office.",
      "The mayor is a smart guy and a talented politician, she said, but his policies have benefited newcomers to the city and business interests more than the longtime Detroiters in her part of town. She found his complaints about a census undercount unconvincing as she went through a mental list of neighbors who had recently left the city.",
      "The number of white Detroiters increased over the last decade after decades of flight, experts said, but the census counted tens of thousands fewer Black Detroiters than lived in the city in 2010. The city\u2019s population of Asian and Hispanic residents also increased since 2010.",
      "The vast majority of Detroit residents are Black. Mr. Duggan is the city\u2019s first white mayor in 40 years.",
      "\u201cHe has opened the door for gentrification \u2014 that is my belief,\u201d Ms. Johnson, a fellow Democrat, said. \u201cHe has given companies contracts over the people.\u201d",
      "Looking at the same evidence, though, some reach the opposite conclusion about Detroit\u2019s trajectory. As Ms. Johnson walked through her neighborhood, pointing out city-owned lots with overgrown weeds and sidewalks littered with liquor bottles, Willie Wesley emerged from his home with a more upbeat view.",
      "Mr. Wesley, a retired U.P.S. worker who helps mow his neighbors\u2019 lawns, said Detroit was on the upswing. His block felt safer. Some long-vacant homes had new buyers. New industrial sites offered the chance for neighbors to earn a good wage.",
      "\u201cI like the mayor I have \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t trade him for nothing right now,\u201d Mr. Wesley said. \u201cHe\u2019s bringing jobs back into the neighborhood.\u201d",
      "Detroit is a city caught in transition. Its distant past as the world\u2019s manufacturing center remains a source of pride. The struggles of recent decades, including the city\u2019s unprecedented journey through municipal bankruptcy, are spoken of with pain. And a vision of its future, though blurry and contested, comes into clearer view with every boarded-up home that is razed, with every coffee shop that opens, with every U-Haul truck heading in or out.",
      "Once the country\u2019s fourth-largest city, Detroit had more than 1.8 million residents at its peak in 1950. By the turn of the century, fewer than a million remained. And in the 2020 census, fewer than 640,000 people were counted and Detroit was barely among the country\u2019s 30 most populous cities.",
      "Those declines are more than a blow to civic pride. They lead to less political power when new legislative districts are drawn and less federal funding.",
      "\u201cI think that is the ultimate test of a city,\u201d Mr. Duggan said. \u201cDo more people want to move in or move out?\u201d",
      "Detroit was far from the only city where the latest census showed a populace in atrophy. Cleveland, Milwaukee, St. Louis and Flint, Mich., were among several other industrial centers in the Midwest that saw their populations drop. In Michigan\u2019s rural Upper Peninsula, almost every county lost residents.",
      "But unlike most local officials who received bad news, Mr. Duggan reacted by engaging in a public fight with the Census Bureau and suggesting he might sue. He said the bureau, under former President Donald J. Trump, did not give on-the-ground canvassers enough time to do their work last year. The change to an online questionnaire also disadvantaged the city, he said. The pandemic did not help.",
      "\u201cThe census is just factually inaccurate,\u201d Mr. Duggan said in an interview, noting that he raised concerns about the process last fall, long before the numbers were published. \u201cIt was census malpractice and we\u2019re going to get it reversed.\u201d",
      "Census officials declined to discuss the mayor\u2019s specific claims, but defended their work in an unsigned statement and said local officials who thought there were errors could appeal. Any corrections would not affect the data used for political redistricting, the bureau said.",
      "There is precedent in Detroit for census disputes paying off. After the 1990 count, Coleman A. Young, the mayor at the time, challenged the tally in court and got the bureau to acknowledge that it missed tens of thousands of residents.",
      "Still, the latest drop in the population provided a political opening for Anthony Adams, who finished a distant second to Mr. Duggan in the low-turnout mayoral primary and who will face his fellow Democrat again in the November general election.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re starting to lose our Black population in the city, and we\u2019re losing it because the policies of this administration are harmful to the people who have been here through thick and thin,\u201d said Mr. Adams, a lawyer who has focused his campaign on crime reduction, police reform and keeping longtime residents in the city.",
      "Even some of Mr. Duggan\u2019s allies were unconvinced by his census rhetoric.",
      "Paul A. Garrison II, an urban planner and economic developer who leads the Osborn Business Association, credited Mr. Duggan with nurturing new businesses, addressing problems in neighborhoods and attracting educated newcomers to Detroit. He said he even had a Duggan campaign sign in his yard. But Mr. Garrison was not buying the claims of a massive population undercount.",
      "\u201cNo mayor,\u201d Mr. Garrison said, \u201cwants to admit that the population of their city is decreasing and people are leaving the city. That\u2019s not good politics.\u201d",
      "Mr. Duggan is betting that Detroiters trust the direction he is steering the city. He says the city\u2019s problems are on a smaller scale than when he took office in the throes of a bankruptcy and a crisis of city services.",
      "\u201cEight years ago, the problems Detroit was facing were just Detroit \u2014 no other city was talking about bankruptcy or streetlights,\u201d Mr. Duggan said. \u201cToday, the challenges that we\u2019re dealing with, every other city has.\u201d",
      "But the question of whether the census count ever officially goes up will be determined one resident, one circumstance at a time.",
      "Earlier this month, at a senior apartment complex that was swamped during this summer\u2019s devastating floods, Kenneth Robinson grew emotional as his belongings were loaded into a moving truck.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a horrible feeling,\u201d he said. \u201cI hate to even think about it. And I\u2019ve got a sick wife with cancer.\u201d",
      "Mr. Robinson, 72, a lifelong Detroiter, had been staying with his wife in a downtown hotel since their unit flooded. Mold and mildew made it unsafe to return home, and financial assistance to stay at the hotel was running out. There was talk about moving temporarily to an extended-stay motel in the suburbs.",
      "Mr. Robinson, who worked in the auto industry and as a janitor before retiring, wanted to eventually move back into his apartment. He wanted to stay in Detroit. But he did not know what would come next."

    "title": "Stephen B. Oates, Civil War Historian, Dies at 85",
    "content": [
      "Stephen B. Oates, a Civil War historian and the biographer of several prominent Americans, including Abraham Lincoln, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and William Faulkner, died on Aug. 20 at his home in Amherst, Mass. He was 85.",
      "His son, Greg, said the cause was pancreatic cancer.",
      "In his best-known works, Dr. Oates explored the lives of four prominent figures \u2014 John Brown, Nat Turner, Lincoln and Dr. King \u2014 in what he called his \u201cCivil War quartet.\u201d",
      "These men, he wrote in \u201cBiography as High Adventure,\u201d an essay published in 1986, \u201chumanize the monstrous moral paradox of slavery and racial oppression in a land based on the ideals of the Declaration of Independence.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cAll four were driven, visionary men, all were caught up in the issues of slavery and race, and all devised their own solutions to those inflammable problems. And all perished, too, in the conflicts and hostilities that surrounded the quest for equality in their country.\u201d",
      "It was a sign of Dr. Oates\u2019s status in his field that Ken Burns, the filmmaker, included him in his epic 1990 PBS documentary \u201cThe Civil War.\u201d",
      "\u201cStephen was an extremely valuable adviser to our Civil War series and an informed and passionate participant,\u201d Mr. Burns said by email. \u201cHe knew the bottom-up story as well as the top-down one, but more importantly, he knew and appreciated the huge stakes for the United States and indeed the world in a Union victory.\u201d",
      "Dr. Oates taught history and biography at the University of Massachusetts Amherst from 1968 to 1997, and his two-volume survey of American history educated a generation of college students.",
      "He was enthralled with other historical figures, especially Clara Barton, who founded the American Red Cross and who worked as a field nurse during the Civil War.",
      "Greg Oates said that his father had been preparing a book on several prominent participants in the Civil War era when he found himself hearing Barton\u2019s voice. What she was saying, Mr. Oates said, was that she didn\u2019t want to be a part of a book that included Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy. And so Dr. Oates paused work on his other book and devoted one solely to her, \u201cA Woman of Valor: Clara Barton and the Civil War\u201d (1994).",
      "\u201cHis biography has a profoundly feminist sensibility, a sense of women as major figures in American history,\u201d Joyce Berkman, a former fellow historian at the University of Massachusetts and a feminist scholar, said of the Barton book in a phone interview. \u201cIt interweaves a gender sensitivity and historical context with remarkable perception.\u201d",
      "Stephen Baery Oates was born on Jan. 5, 1936, in Pampa, Texas. His father, Steve Theodore Oates, was a mechanic. His mother, Florence (Baer) Oates, was an office secretary.",
      "He attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in history in 1958, his master\u2019s in 1960 and his doctorate in 1969.",
      "He married Helen Perry, a fellow student at the university, in the mid-1960s. That marriage ended in divorce, as did two subsequent marriages.",
      "In addition to his son, Dr. Oates is survived by a daughter, Stephanie Oates; four grandchildren; and a brother, Michael.  Another brother, Anthony, died in 2018.",
      "Dr. Oates ran into some controversy in the early 1990s when he was accused of plagiarism in three books, including one about Lincoln, \u201cWith Malice Toward None\u201d (1977). The allegations, which he vehemently denied, concerned the borrowing of words and sentence structure rather than the verbatim copying of text and caused a division within history circles.",
      "The American Historical Association, which examined the charges, issued an ambiguous ruling in 1993, saying there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that Dr. Oates had committed plagiarism \u201cas it is conventionally understood.\u201d But it did find evidence \u201cof too great and too continuous dependence, even with attribution, on the structure, distinctive language and rhetorical strategies of other scholars and sources.\u201d",
      "More than 20 historians came to Dr. Oates\u2019s defense, but the allegations snowballed, diverted him from his work and took their toll.",
      "\u201cMany of us in the field regarded it as a criticism that grew into an assault and became a tragedy,\u201d Harold Holzer, a prominent Lincoln scholar, said in an interview. \u201cHe was too big a talent to be silenced, but in many ways he was, at least as an historian.\u201d",
      "Greg Oates said that although the charges \u201ctook a lot out of him emotionally and physically,\u201d his father regrouped and went on to write a different kind of history, in which he relied on the historical record but wrote in the first person from the perspective of historical figures involved in the coming Civil War. He published \u201cThe Approaching Fury: Voices of the Storm, 1820-1861\u201d in 1997 and a sequel, \u201cThe Whirlwind of War: Voices of the Storm, 1861-1865,\u201d in 1998.",
      "\u201cHe was able to launch himself back into the epic saga of the war, which was the culmination of all of his knowledge and research,\u201d his son said. In creating monologues for the historical figures, he was inspired by the actors Hal Holbrook and Julie Harris, who impersonated Mark Twain and Emily Dickinson onstage. His work was well received.",
      "\u201cThis book powerfully recreates some of the momentous events that produced the catastrophe of 1861,\u201d the historian Robert Remini wrote in a 1997 review of the first volume in The New York Times. \u201cMr. Oates succeeds in bringing his characters alive and in creating highly dramatic scenes for them to act out.\u201d",
      "Dr. Oates started working on a book about the Cuban missile crisis in the same style, his son said, but he developed severe back problems and wasn\u2019t able to continue. He was able, however, to serve as a consultant and adviser to his son, who is adapting some of his works for television and film."

    "title": "Austin Police Officer Is Charged With Murder in a Second On-Duty Killing",
    "content": [
      "A police officer in Austin, Texas, who was charged with murdering a man in April 2020 has been charged with murdering another man about nine months earlier, prosecutors said on Friday.",
      "The latest indictments charge the officer, Christopher Taylor, 29, and another officer, Karl Krycia, 28, with murder and deadly conduct in the fatal shooting of Mauris DeSilva, 46, who had been holding a knife in the hallway of his condominium complex on July 31, 2019.",
      "The charges came five months after Officer Taylor had been charged with fatally shooting Michael Ramos, 42, outside an Austin apartment complex on April 24, 2020.",
      "The killing of Mr. Ramos, who was Black and Hispanic, set off protests against police violence in Austin about a month before the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis catalyzed global demonstrations against police brutality and systemic racism.",
      "Mr. DeSilva had severe mental illness and had been holding a knife to his neck when people in the building called 911, according to a lawsuit filed by his father that accuses Officers Taylor and Krycia of knowing that Mr. DeSilva was experiencing a mental health crisis and yet still responding \u201cas if this were the scene of a violent crime.\u201d",
      "Officer Taylor\u2019s lawyers argued that he had been protecting himself after Mr. DeSilva refused to drop the knife and came within three or four feet of the officer.",
      "\u201cWhat happened was undoubtedly tragic, particularly if it is true the man was experiencing a psychiatric episode, but in no way was this murder,\u201d the lawyers, Ken Ervin and Doug O\u2019Connell, said in a statement.",
      "They accused Jos\u00e9 Garza, a former federal public defender who was elected Travis County district attorney in November 2020, of \u201cwaging a war on police officers.\u201d",
      "Mr. Garza\u2019s office responded by noting that, since January, 12 officers whose potentially criminal conduct had been reviewed by a grand jury did not end up facing charges.",
      "Jason English, a lawyer for Officer Krycia, said in a statement, \u201cWhile we are sorry any time that a life is lost, we do believe that the actions were reasonable under the facts and justified under the law.\u201d",
      "Officer Krycia has been placed on paid administrative duty, Austin\u2019s police chief, Joseph Chacon, said. Officer Taylor remains on leave without pay in connection with the killing of Mr. Ramos, he said.",
      "\u201cAPD respects the role the grand jury holds in the criminal justice process and will continue to cooperate with the District Attorney\u2019s Office on this case,\u201d Chief Chacon said in a statement that noted that the officers were presumed innocent.",
      "Lawyers for Mr. DeSilva\u2019s father, Denzil DeSilva, said the charges would begin to help him heal.",
      "\u201cDue to the excessive force used by Austin Police Department officers, Denzil lost a beloved son, and the world lost a talented scientist and researcher,\u201d the father\u2019s lawyers said in a statement.",
      "Mr. DeSilva grew up in Sri Lanka and had a doctorate in biomedical engineering, according to the father\u2019s lawsuit. He also suffered from \u201cincreasingly severe mental illness\u201d during the last years of his life, which the Austin police knew about, according to the lawsuit.",
      "In February 2015, Mr. DeSilva grabbed a knife and threatened to hurt himself, and the Austin police responded, taking him to a hospital. In May 2019, he required \u201can emotionally disturbed person\u201d intervention by the police, and on July 7, 2019, just weeks before he was fatally shot, he was committed to emergency detention, according to the lawsuit.",
      "On the day Mr. DeSilva was killed, a neighbor called 911 to report that Mr. DeSilva was having \u201canother mental episode\u201d and asked that a mental health officer be dispatched, according to the lawsuit. Several others who saw Mr. DeSilva holding a knife to his neck also called 911.",
      "Austin had a mental health officer on duty at the time, but Officers Taylor and Krycia and two other officers responded instead, the lawsuit states. They spoke to building workers, reviewed security footage and knew that Mr. DeSilva was experiencing a mental health crisis, the lawsuit states.",
      "After taking an elevator to the fifth floor with a building worker, the officers found Mr. DeSilva in the hallway, with his back to them, looking in a mirror with a knife to his neck, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Officers Taylor and Krycia shouted at Mr. DeSilva to drop the knife, and he lowered it. Officers then shouted, \u201cHey, man,\u201d and Mr. DeSilva took one step in their direction, the lawsuit states.",
      "Another officer fired a Taser at Mr. DeSilva, and Officers Taylor and Krycia simultaneously fired multiple shots at Mr. DeSilva, striking him in the chest, the lawsuit states. Mr. DeSilva was pronounced dead at a hospital.",
      "About nine months later, on April 24, 2020, Officer Taylor went to the parking lot of an apartment complex after a 911 caller reported that Mr. Ramos was sitting in a car with drugs and holding a gun, with a woman next to him, the police said.",
      "After meeting outside the apartment complex, he and a number of other officers confronted Mr. Ramos.",
      "Dashboard camera video released by the police last year shows officers repeatedly ordering Mr. Ramos to put his hands up and step out of the car. Mr. Ramos can be seen getting out with his hands up. Officers then tell him to lift up his shirt and turn around in a circle, which he did.",
      "Mr. Ramos waves his hands and yells at the officers, asking at one point, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d He also yells, \u201cI ain\u2019t got no gun, dog!\u201d with an expletive added.",
      "An officer fired a bean bag at Mr. Ramos, striking him in the thigh, the authorities said. Mr. Ramos then got back into the car and drove forward as officers yelled at him not to leave.",
      "Officer Taylor fired three rounds from his rifle at Mr. Ramos\u2019s moving car, striking him, the police said. Emergency medical workers took Mr. Ramos to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.",
      "The Austin police confirmed after the shooting that Mr. Ramos had not had a gun. Mr. Ervin said that Officer Taylor planned to plead not guilty in the fatal shooting of Mr. Ramos."

    "title": "The Latest G.O.P. Schism: How to Handle Afghan Evacuees",
    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Republican Party is united in its criticism of President Biden\u2019s chaotic military withdrawal from Afghanistan. But the crisis has also exposed a deep internal divide between party leaders over relocating Afghan refugees at home.",
      "Many Republican lawmakers have accused Mr. Biden of abandoning the Afghan interpreters and guides who helped the United States during two decades of war, leaving thousands of people in limbo in a country now controlled by the Taliban.",
      "But others \u2014 including former President Donald J. Trump and Representative Kevin McCarthy, the minority leader \u2014 have sought to fold the issue of Afghan refugees into the anti-immigrant stance of the party\u2019s far right. They are criticizing Mr. Biden not simply for leaving the Afghans behind, but for opening the United States up to what they characterized as dangerous foreigners.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll have terrorists coming across the border,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said last week on a call with a group of bipartisan House members, according to two people who were on the call, where he railed against the Biden administration\u2019s handling of the withdrawal. He also brought up the issue of migrants entering the country along the U.S.-Mexico border in his discussion of Afghans being evacuated.",
      "In fact, the Afghan evacuees fleeing the Taliban\u2019s return are subject to extensive background checks by intelligence officials to receive Special Immigrant Visas, a lengthy and complex process available to those who face threats because of work for the U.S. government. In the past, it has taken years for applications to be processed.",
      "In a statement on Tuesday, Mr. Trump suggested, without evidence, that unvetted Afghans were boarding military flights and that an unknown number of terrorists had already been airlifted out of Afghanistan. The former president has also criticized the evacuation of vetted Afghans from Kabul, arguing that military planes should have been \u201cfull of Americans.\u201d",
      "The unusual split is pitting traditional conservatives, who are more inclined to defend those who have sacrificed for America, against the anti-immigrant, anti-refugee wing of the party. And it is a fresh test of Mr. Trump\u2019s power to make Republican leaders fall in line behind him.",
      "\u201cThe core divide within the Republican Party, post-Trump, is on immigration,\u201d said Frank Luntz, the Republican pollster. \u201cThe Republican Party used to be the party of immigration, and Trump changed all of that.\u201d",
      "The debate highlights the larger ideological divide within the party between \u201cAmerica First\u201d isolationists like Mr. Trump and Republicans who believe maintaining strong alliances and America\u2019s influence abroad benefits the country\u2019s security.",
      "For now, the faction of the Republican Party that supports helping Afghan translators and refugees resettle in the United States is larger than the one warning of any potential dangers that could accompany their resettlement. A recent CBS News/YouGov poll found that 76 percent of Republicans, and 79 of independents, supported efforts to bring Afghans who have helped the U.S. here.",
      "And in two focus groups of Trump voters conducted last week in Georgia and Wyoming by Sarah Longwell, an anti-Trump Republican strategist, the vast majority said that \u201cwe should be taking the interpreters and refugees, with some caveats about proper vetting,\u201d Ms. Longwell said.",
      "She attributed that feeling to a level of patriotism that is lacking when those voters look at migrants crossing the Southern border. \u201cAt a gut level, these are people who fought with us in a war,\u201d Ms. Longwell said.",
      "On the issue of Afghan refugees, Mr. McCarthy has walked the same tightrope that he has on other issues, trying to appease the two sides of the party. He has stated publicly that \u201cwe owe it to these people, who are our friends and who worked with us, to get them out safely if we can.\u201d But he has also leaned into the nativist, Trumpian side, giving voice to the generalized, inchoate fears about foreigners entering the country.",
      "Traditionally, evangelical groups and Christian charities that wield influence on the right have supported refugee resettlement, prompting elected leaders who are dependent on their support to follow suit. But other lawmakers have echoed the fear and anger Mr. McCarthy expressed on the bipartisan call.",
      "Representative Matt Rosendale, Republican of Montana, warned that once Afghans are resettled in the U.S., \u201cthey could bring additional people.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe chaos we\u2019re seeing is not an excuse to flood our country with refugees from Afghanistan,\u201d said Mr. Rosendale, who is running for re-election.",
      "And Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, criticized her state\u2019s Republican governor for saying he was open to the state\u2019s accepting refugees.",
      "\u201cWill this bring chain migration too?\u201d she asked on Twitter, referring to family-based immigration. \u201cHow much will it cost GA taxpayers in Gov assistance?\u201d",
      "Last month, the House passed a bill to distribute an additional 8,000 visas for translators. Ms. Greene voted against the bill along with other Republicans, including Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona, Representative Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama.",
      "Anti-refugee policies have been at the core of Mr. Trump\u2019s nativist appeal since he entered the political arena in 2015 warning that Mexican \u201crapists\u201d were going to bring drugs and crime into the country. Mr. Trump and his allies supported a travel ban, which suspended immigrant and nonimmigrant visas to applicants from seven countries, five of which had Muslim majorities. Their rallying cry was the construction of a wall along the Southern border to keep migrants out. And they barred the entry of Syrian refugees into the United States.",
      "But some Republicans who in the past have fallen in line with Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies are finding themselves on the other side of the Afghan refugee debate.",
      "Representative Elise Stefanik, Republican of New York, a onetime moderate who was elected to her party\u2019s No. 3 House post after winning Mr. Trump\u2019s endorsement, signed a letter alongside progressive Democrats calling on Mr. Biden to commit to saving Afghan allies.",
      "Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, released a statement expressing concern for the Afghan allies being harassed and abused by the Taliban. \u201cPresident Biden should commit to staying in Afghanistan until we have rescued every American citizen and those Afghans who risked their lives for American troops,\u201d said Mr. Cotton, an Army veteran who served in Afghanistan and Iraq.",
      "And Alyssa Farah, the former communications director in the Trump White House, said helping Afghans who served alongside U.S. forces was a \u201cmoral imperative.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo those on the right suggesting they aren\u2019t vetted and we shouldn\u2019t be willing to take them in: they were vetted enough to be co-located with U.S. forces and to put their lives on the line to help them,\u201d Ms. Farah said. \u201cThose opposing relocating refugees to the U.S. are egregiously misreading public sentiment, especially within the Christian community in the U.S.\u201d",
      "Stephen Miller, a former policy adviser to Mr. Trump known for hard-right immigration policies, dismissed the split and said he believed his party would ultimately coalesce around opposition to letting Afghans resettle in large numbers across the country.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an enormous amount of agreement among conservatives that there is no desire among the American public at all for a large-scale resettlement of generalized refugees,\u201d he said.",
      "With right-wing hosts on Fox News like Laura Ingraham and Tucker Carlson aligning with the anti-refugee wing of the party, Ms. Longwell, the Republican strategist, said that \u201cthe open question\u201d was whether Republican sentiment that America was morally obligated to help Afghan allies \u201cdiminishes after two weeks.\u201d",
      "\u201cIs it really our responsibility to welcome thousands of potentially unvetted refugees from Afghanistan?\u201d Ms. Ingraham said on her prime-time cable news show last week.",
      "Some Democrats have noticed the fissure among Republicans who have typically fallen in line behind Mr. Trump and are hopeful it could be a sign that the former president\u2019s grip on the party has diminished.",
      "\u201cI have members from the progressive left of the Democratic Party all the way to the most hawkish, all agreeing we need to get vulnerable Afghans out,\u201d said Representative Tom Malinowski, Democrat of New Jersey, who served as an assistant secretary of state during the Obama administration. Mr. Malinowski has been pressing the White House to commit to keeping troops in Kabul until all Americans and Afghan allies are safely evacuated.",
      "\u201cMaybe it\u2019s an opportunity for some of my friends on the other side to make the G.O.P. the party of Reagan, not Trump, when it comes to refugees,\u201d he said.",
      "Other Democrats said it was unrealistic to expect Republicans to break from Mr. Trump\u2019s grip.",
      "\u201cThey will toe the line and parrot Trump\u2019s nativism,\u201d said Philippe Reines, a former adviser to Hillary Clinton at the State Department. \u201cWhen he preaches \u2018Afghanistan didn\u2019t send its best,\u2019 his whole temple will say \u2018amen.\u2019\u201d",
      "For now, the G.O.P. remains united in capitalizing on Mr. Biden\u2019s first major foreign policy crisis as a way to chip away at the standing of a president who ran on competence.",
      "The America First Policy Institute, a group formed by former top officials in the Trump administration, has already run online ads replaying some of the footage of chaos at the Kabul airport, contrasting it with Mr. Biden\u2019s promise that there would be \u201cno circumstance where you\u2019re going to see people being lifted off the roof of an embassy of the United States from Afghanistan.\u201d"

    "title": "How the Delta Variant Infiltrated an Elementary School Classroom",
    "content": [
      "An unvaccinated elementary schoolteacher infected with the highly contagious Delta variant spread the virus to half of the students in a classroom, seeding an outbreak that eventually infected 26 people, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The unusually detailed study, which comes as school districts across the country reopen, seems certain to intensify the debate over vaccine mandates in schools. A handful of school districts, including New York City, have already announced vaccine requirements for teachers and staff.",
      "Others may follow suit now that the Food and Drug Administration has granted full approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.",
      "\u201cThe most important thing we can do to protect schoolchildren, particularly those too young to be vaccinated, is to make sure the adults in their lives, including teachers and school staff, are vaccinated,\u201d said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, who was not involved in the report.",
      "The study was one of three new C.D.C. reports that focused on schools or children. In another study, researchers found more evidence that schools can be low-risk environments when they combine several precautionary measures. But that research was conducted before the Delta variant began spreading.",
      "A third report focused on vaccination rates for teenagers. Half of all 12- to 17-year-olds have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, the White House announced on Friday. But the new study revealed that vaccination rates for this age group remained highly uneven across the country.",
      "Together, the studies highlight both how much scientists have learned about how to protect children in schools \u2014 and how much remains uncertain now that the Delta variant has arrived.",
      "The classroom outbreak occurred in Marin County, Calif., in May. Neither the school nor the staff members and students involved were identified.",
      "The teacher first showed symptoms on May 19, but worked for two days before getting tested. During this time, the teacher read aloud, unmasked, to a class of 24 students, despite rules requiring both teachers and students to wear masks indoors.",
      "All the students were too young for vaccination, which has been authorized only for people ages 12 and older.",
      "On May 23, the teacher reported testing positive for infection with the coronavirus. Over the next several days, 12 of the students also tested positive.",
      "\u201cI thought I respected its contagiousness,\u201d Dr. Lisa Santora, deputy health officer at the Marin Health and Human Services and an author of the report, said of the Delta variant. But its efficiency in overtaking the classroom \u201csurprised and humbled\u201d her.",
      "In the classroom, rates of infection roughly corresponded to the seating chart. Everyone in the front row tested positive, tapering to 80 percent in the first two rows.",
      "In the back three rows, only 28 percent of students tested positive. \u201cIf teacher has no mask, move to the back of the class,\u201d Edward Traver, an infectious disease fellow at the University of Maryland Medical Center, said in a Twitter message.",
      "Six students in another grade at the school also tested positive for the virus. The cases spread outward from the school into the community: At least eight parents and siblings of the infected students, three of whom were fully vaccinated, also were infected.",
      "State health researchers sequenced specimens of the virus from many of the positive cases and found that all had been infected with the Delta variant. Samples from at least 10 students in two grades were genetically indistinguishable. The results suggested that the cases in both grades came from the same outbreak.",
      "The outbreak was likely fueled both by Delta\u2019s high level of infectiousness and by the fact that the teacher did not follow recommended safety precautions, the researchers said.",
      "\u201cWe have to make sure both schools and individuals are working together to make sure we are safe,\u201d said Tracy Lam-Hine, an epidemiologist at Marin County Health and Human Services and an author on the new report. \u201cIt can\u2019t be just one or the other.\u201d",
      "In other areas of the country, the toll on the community might have been even higher. Marin County has the highest vaccination rate in California. The report noted that 72 percent of eligible people in the surrounding community were fully vaccinated, and suggested that high rates may have prevented further transmission.",
      "In another new study, researchers focused on case rates in Los Angeles County, where some students and teachers attended school in person last year, while others did so remotely.",
      "Schools that opened for in-person learning were required to take a variety of precautions, including symptom screening, masking, physical distancing and contact tracing. During most of the period between September and March \u2014 and especially during the winter surge \u2014 case rates were lower in the schools, for both teachers and students, than they were in the county at large.",
      "The findings are consistent with previous studies that have found that when schools layer together several protective measures, case rates are often lower in schools than they are in the surrounding community.",
      "\u201cSchool is a safer place in many ways for youth to be, because it\u2019s so structured and supervised,\u201d said Dr. Santora, who has a 9-year-old and an 11-year-old returning to school in-person this fall.",
      "But the studies on school mitigation measures, including the report from Los Angeles, were conducted before the Delta variant began spreading. The variant is roughly twice as transmissible as the original version of the virus, and now accounts for nearly all infections in the United States.",
      "Whether the same kinds of precautions will keep the variant in check in schools this year remains uncertain, and many schools have opened without the safety measures that public health experts recommend.",
      "Siobhan Flynn, who teaches first grade at a public charter school in the Washington area, is worried about classes starting on Monday. The school at which Ms. Flynn works is using a layered protection approach that includes a mask mandate, socially distanced desks and randomized testing for students.",
      "\u201cKids need to be in school, but I just wish more money and planning had gone into safely opening schools,\u201d Ms. Flynn said. \u201cA lot of people would feel a lot safer if all the staff was vaccinated.\u201d",
      "Vaccination rates have been increasing in recent weeks as Delta continues to drive a surge of cases, hospitalizations and deaths nationwide. But parents have been anxious about sending young children back to school when they cannot yet be vaccinated.",
      "The F.D.A. first authorized the vaccines for 12- to 15-year-olds in May, and by July 31, more than one-third of them had gotten at least one shot, according to a third C.D.C. report. More than half of 16- to 17-year-olds, who were eligible for the vaccine months earlier, had received at least one dose.",
      "But vaccination rates vary greatly across the country. In Mississippi, just 11 percent of adolescents have been fully vaccinated, compared with 60 percent in Vermont, the researchers found.",
      "Dr. Westyn Branch-Elliman, an infectious disease researcher at Harvard Medical School, said in an email that she hoped to see schools \u201cbecome more involved in promoting vaccine uptake for everyone who is eligible in the school community through things like vaccination clinics set up in schools to improve access and alleviate barriers.\u201d",
      "Clinical trials of the vaccines in young children are underway. Pfizer has said that results should be available in September."

    "content": [
      "DOHA, Qatar \u2014 The nightmare that kept counterterrorism experts awake even before the Taliban returned to power is that Afghanistan would become fertile ground for terrorist groups, most notably Al Qaeda and the Islamic State.",
      "Two explosions claimed by the Islamic State that killed dozens of people, including at least 13 American service members, in Kabul on Thursday bolstered fears that the nightmare was fast becoming a reality.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how upsetting and depressing this is,\u201d said Saad Mohseni, the owner of Tolo, one of Afghanistan\u2019s most popular television channels. \u201cIt feels like it\u2019s back to business as usual \u2014 more bombings, more attacks, except that now we\u2019re going to have to deal with it all under a Taliban regime.\u201d",
      "Twenty years of military action by the United States and its international partners aimed at stamping out terrorism have exacted major tolls on Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, killing many of their fighters and leaders and largely preventing them from holding territory.",
      "But both groups have proved able to adapt, terrorism experts say, evolving into more diffuse organizations that continually seek out new global trouble spots to take root and put their violent extremism into action.",
      "The twin suicide bombings near the Kabul airport on Thursday underscored the devastating power these groups still have to inflict mass casualties in spite of the American effort. And they raised haunting questions about whether the Taliban can live up to the central promise they made when the Trump administration agreed in early 2020 to withdraw American forces from the country \u2014 that Afghanistan would no longer be a staging ground for attacks against the United States and its allies.",
      "The Taliban\u2019s lightning takeover of the country hardly assures that all militants in Afghanistan are under their control. To the contrary, the Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan \u2014 known as Islamic State Khorasan or ISIS-K \u2014 is a bitter, albeit much smaller, rival that has carried out dozens of attacks in Afghanistan this year against civilians, officials and the Taliban themselves.",
      "In the months before American forces withdrew, some 8,000 to 10,000 jihadi fighters from Central Asia, the North Caucasus region of Russia, Pakistan and the Xinjiang region in western China poured into Afghanistan, a United Nations report concluded in June. Most are associated with the Taliban or Al Qaeda, which are closely linked.",
      "But others are allied with ISIS-K, presenting a major challenge to the stability and security the Taliban promise to provide for the country.",
      "While terrorism experts doubt that ISIS fighters in Afghanistan have the capacity to mount large-scale attacks against the West, many say that the Islamic State is now more dangerous, in more parts of the world, than Al Qaeda.",
      "\u201cIt is clear that the Islamic State is the bigger threat, in Iraq and Syria, in Asia or Africa,\u201d said Hassan Abu Hanieh, an expert on Islamic movements at the Politics and Society Institute in Amman, Jordan. \u201cIt is clear that ISIS is spread more widely and is more attractive to the new generations.\u201d",
      "Just Wednesday, American officials warned of specific threats by the group, including that it could send suicide bombers to infiltrate the crowds outside Kabul\u2019s Hamid Karzai International Airport.",
      "The threat seems to have been a factor in President Biden\u2019s decision to stick to his Aug. 31 deadline to withdraw all American forces from the country.",
      "\u201cEvery day we\u2019re on the ground is another day we know that ISIS-K is seeking to target the airport and attack both U.S. and allied forces and innocent civilians,\u201d Mr. Biden said Wednesday.",
      "Created six years ago by disaffected Pakistani Taliban fighters, ISIS-K has vastly increased the pace of its attacks this year, the U.N. report said.",
      "The group\u2019s ranks had fallen to about 1,500 to 2,000 fighters, about half that of its peak in 2016 before American airstrikes and Afghan commando raids took a toll, killing many of its leaders.",
      "But since June 2020, the group has been led by an ambitious new commander, Shahab al-Muhajir, who is trying to recruit disaffected Taliban fighters and other militants. ISIS-K \u201cremains active and dangerous,\u201d the U.N. report said.",
      "The Islamic State in Afghanistan has mostly been antagonistic toward the Taliban. At times the two groups have fought for turf, particularly in eastern Afghanistan, and ISIS recently denounced the Taliban\u2019s takeover of Afghanistan. Some analysts say that fighters from Taliban networks have even defected to join ISIS in Afghanistan, adding more experienced fighters to its ranks.",
      "The history of the Islamic State shows how difficult it can be to shut down and contain terrorist networks. The group began after the American invasion of Iraq in 2003 as a branch of Al Qaeda, but later broke away, establishing a so-called caliphate, an Islamic theocracy, in large parts of Iraq and Syria that at its peak was the size of Britain.",
      "The group\u2019s extremist vision for global expansion, extensive use of social media and cinematic violence drew in fighters from around the world, inspiring deadly attacks in Arab, European and American cities, and spurring the United States to form an international coalition to combat it.",
      "As the United States and its partners bombed the group\u2019s main territories, the Islamic State branched out in other countries. Many of these affiliates have remained active since the group lost its last patch of territory in Syria in March 2019, including in West and Central Africa, the Sinai and South Asia.",
      "Al Qaeda has changed substantially as well since Osama bin Laden oversaw the organization and spread his views via videotaped statements delivered to television stations.",
      "It, too, established affiliates, in Yemen, Iraq, Syria and parts of Africa and Asia, some of which modified, or even discarded, the group\u2019s ideology in pursuit of local goals. The group\u2019s current leader, Ayman al-Zawahri, is elderly and believed to be ailing and living somewhere in Afghanistan, after failing to match Bin Laden\u2019s stature among Islamic radicals.",
      "In general, Al Qaeda did not maintain the same operational control over its affiliates as the Islamic State did, which may have given the latter an advantage, said Hassan Hassan, the co-author of a book about the Islamic State and the editor in chief of Newlines Magazine.",
      "For Al Qaeda, \u201cit\u2019s like opening a Domino\u2019s franchise and you send someone out for quality control,\u201d he said. The Islamic State, on the other hand, would \u201ctake it one step further and appoint a manager from the original organization.\u201d",
      "ISIS also terrified cities around the world with its call for so-called lone wolf attacks, in which a jihadist with no orders from the group\u2019s commanders would record a video pledging allegiance to the group\u2019s leader and then carry out atrocities. The central group would then publicize and support the attacks.",
      "The two groups remain bitter foes, compete for recruits and financing and have fought directly against each other, in Afghanistan, Syria and elsewhere.",
      "Afghanistan could now become their primary battlefield, as the United States withdraws its troops and the Taliban extend their control.",
      "In an agreement with the Trump administration last year, the Taliban vowed not to allow Al Qaeda to use Afghan territory to attack the United States. But how closely the Taliban will respect that commitment, and whether they can, remain open questions.",
      "The Islamic State has no such constraints, which could leave it better positioned to exploit the chaos surrounding the Aug. 31 deadline for the United States withdrawal and the transition from a United States-backed government to the Taliban.",
      "\u201cThe changeover from one security force to another, by default, provides an opportunity for ISIS,\u201d Mr. Hassan said.",
      "How the Taliban choose to govern this time around is likely to affect the future of the terrorist groups in Afghanistan. In their public statements since seizing Kabul, Taliban officials have put forward a more accommodating face, suggesting that they would not impose the same strict interpretation of Islamic rules with the same iron fist as they did before they were ousted by the American-led invasion of 2001.",
      "But the group is hardly united, said Mr. Abu Hanieh, the expert on Islamic movements, and steps toward moderation by the leadership could lead to defections by hard-line members to the Islamic State.",
      "\u201cThis is a big challenge for the Taliban,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if they wanted to get rid of the radical wing, it would not be easy.\u201d"

    "content": [
      "What might a more successful exit from Afghanistan have looked like?",
      "I have spent some time talking with colleagues and experts about that question, and it is a difficult one to answer. President Biden\u2019s exit certainly has not gone well. The \u201corderly\u201d withdrawal he had promised did not happen, and the world has watched agonizing scenes of Afghans trying to escape.",
      "But I\u2019ve also noticed a na\u00efvet\u00e9 about some of the commentary on Afghanistan. It presumes that there was a clean solution for the U.S., if only the Biden administration (and, to a lesser extent, the Trump administration) had executed it. The commentary never quite spells out what the solution was, though.",
      "There is a reason for that: A clean solution probably did not exist.",
      "The fundamental choice, as my colleague Helene Cooper told me, was between a permanent, low-level U.S. war in Afghanistan \u2014 a version of what John McCain once called a 100-year war \u2014 and a messy exit. \u201cThe pullout was never going to be a simple thing,\u201d says Helene, who covers the Pentagon. \u201cIt was always going to be an ugly pullout.\u201d",
      "My goal with today\u2019s newsletter is to explain what the true options in Afghanistan were, as well as some alternate decisions by the Biden administration that might have worked out better.",
      "It\u2019s important to start with this background: The biggest failure in Afghanistan almost certainly was not anything that happened this week or even in the past decade. It was a decision, early in the 2000s, to seek total victory in a faraway war of questionable relevance to U.S. national interests. As Adam Nossiter, who became The Times\u2019s Kabul bureau chief last year, has written, \u201cThe American war, like other such neocolonialist adventures,\u201d was \u201cmost likely doomed from the start.\u201d",
      "The most salient failure of the Biden pullout is the apparent abandonment of thousands of Afghans who worked closely with the U.S. and whom the Taliban may jail, abuse or kill.",
      "These allies have fought against the Taliban for years, served as translators for Americans and helped run civil society in Afghanistan. Many are understandably panicked. Something like 100,000 Afghans probably fall into this disparate category, experts say.",
      "In hindsight, the solution may seem obvious: The U.S. should have helped many more Afghans leave the country before the military withdrawal. In reality, there was no easy way to do so.",
      "When Biden and Afghanistan\u2019s then-president, Ashraf Ghani, met for the final time, in the Oval Office on June 25, one of Ghani\u2019s main requests was that the U.S. do the opposite and limit evacuations. As The Times has reported: \u201cHe wanted the United States to be \u2018conservative\u2019 in granting exit visas to the interpreters and others, and \u2018low key\u2019 about their leaving the country so it would not look as if America lacked faith in his government.\u201d",
      "It was an understandable request. A mass evacuation would have amounted to a surrender to the Taliban (for which Biden would have been blamed). The only hope for Ghani\u2019s government depended on avoiding a large, advance evacuation of the Afghans who were helping run the country.",
      "In the end, of course, Afghanistan still fell to the Taliban in a few chaotic days this month.",
      "The fairest criticism of Biden acknowledges the implausibility of an enormous advance evacuation \u2014 and then grapples with the less-satisfying alternatives. They do exist.",
      "Biden and his team appear to have based their strategy around the consensus view of U.S. intelligence that the Ghani government could hold off the Taliban for months, at least. Little of the White House\u2019s pre-withdrawal planning was based on the possibility \u2014 as some diplomats and Afghan officials were warning \u2014 that the government could quickly collapse.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about life and death, you can\u2019t just rely on the consensus opinion,\u201d Michael Crowley, who covers the State Department for The Times, told me. \u201cYou have to prepare for contingencies.\u201d",
      "In Afghanistan, contingency planning could have included a much more rapid acceleration of the State Department\u2019s processing of refugee visas, still done quietly. The administration also could have been less definitive about the military\u2019s August exit date: The more territory the Taliban seemed to gain, the more U.S. troops could have remained temporarily, to oversee evacuation.",
      "Both Michael and Helene point out that these scenarios probably still would have been messy. A huge, quiet evacuation program is a contradiction in terms. And under almost any circumstance, more Afghans would have wanted to leave a Taliban-run country than the U.S. would have been willing to admit (especially with the current immigration skepticism in this country). \u201cPeople were still going to run to Kabul airport,\u201d Helene says.",
      "Since the fall of Kabul on Aug. 15, the Biden administration has been trying to accomplish the large evacuation program that it could not attempt earlier. So far, the U.S. has helped about 70,000 people leave, although it is unclear how many of them are Afghans. Ultimately, the evacuation has the potential to look fairly successful.",
      "Yet that would not make Biden blameless. Put it this way: If he and his aides could do it all over again and be less dismissive of a rapid Taliban takeover, don\u2019t you think they would?",
      "One final alternative did exist: The U.S. military could have stayed in Afghanistan. There is no reason to think it would have succeeded in creating a stable Afghan government, after failing to do so for 20 years. But it probably could have prevented complete Taliban control.",
      "The economic costs were manageable, in the short term. The U.S. mission has recently cost less than $20 billion a year, Todd Harrison of the Center for Strategic and International Studies told me. That\u2019s less than 0.5 percent of the federal budget. The continuing war was also killing a handful of American troops each year, and the bombing of Taliban targets was killing hundreds of Afghan civilians a year.",
      "Some former U.S. officials have suggested that staying in Afghanistan indefinitely was worth these costs. On the other hand, these tend to be the same officials whose previous optimistic promises have repeatedly proven false. At some point, the conflict with the Taliban would likely have intensified again, requiring more U.S. troops, money and sacrifice. Already, polls showed that a large, bipartisan majority of Americans wanted the military to leave.",
      "All of which suggests that a withdrawal may have been inevitable, sooner rather than later. It could have gone better than it has. But it was probably destined not to go well.",

    "title": "Remaking the Economy",
    "content": [
      "President Biden\u2019s domestic agenda seems to be back on track in Congress.",
      "House Democrats resolved a procedural spat this week, and they and Senate Democrats are now turning to the substantive work of putting together a sprawling bill meant to slow climate change, reduce poverty and expand pre-K, college financial aid and Medicare benefits.",
      "The package represents Biden\u2019s most ambitious attempt to reshape the American economy \u2014 more so than either the large infrastructure bill also making its way through Congress or the pandemic-relief law that Biden signed in March. The newest bill is likely to be larger and longer lasting, and would affect many aspects of daily life, like education, health care and perhaps even the weather.",
      "But the bill will need to survive a narrow path to pass. No Republicans are likely to support it. Democrats will thus need to maintain the support of all 50 of their senators, including moderates like Joe Manchin of West Virginia, and lose no more than three House members.",
      "Today, we offer a guide to the package, which will occupy Congress for much of the next month and maybe beyond. Daily news coverage tends to focus on the procedural back-and-forth, for the simple reason that members of Congress and their aides are also focused on that back-and-forth. We\u2019ll step back to walk you through the plan\u2019s substance, including the contentious parts and the areas where Democrats seem to have a consensus.",
      "If Biden is going to sign meaningful climate legislation in his first two years \u2014 and maybe ever \u2014 it will be as part of this bill.",
      "The most significant provision would push the electricity sector to reduce pollution sharply over the next 15 years, which scientists say would have a major impact on carbon emissions. It would do so by subsidizing the use of solar, wind, nuclear and other forms of clean energy while financially penalizing the use of dirty energy like coal, our colleague Lisa Friedman says.",
      "This electricity plan seems likely to be included in a final bill, although Manchin has been vague about his position on it. One unknown: How will it treat natural gas, which is less polluting than coal but more polluting than other energy forms?",
      "The bill is also likely to help families pay for electric cars and energy-efficient homes. Another uncertainty is whether the bill will include something known as a carbon border adjustment tax \u2014 a tax on imports whose production was carbon-intensive, like many from China.",
      "\u201cThe health care parts of the bill are huge,\u201d our colleague Margot Sanger-Katz says. \u201cThere is a lot of health care policy that will have real effects in the lives of people.\u201d And many of the provisions seem likely to survive in the final bill.",
      "Medicare would expand to include dental, hearing and vision coverage for Americans over 65 \u2014 an important change, given how many of them struggle to see, hear or chew, Margot says. Medicaid (the federal program focused on low-income people) would expand specifically in the 12 states that have not signed up for the program\u2019s Obamacare expansion. Subsidies for private Obamacare plans would also grow, as would money for home health care, to help more people avoid nursing homes.",
      "Margot says that her reporting on Capitol Hill indicates the biggest uncertainty is how aggressive Congress will be about trying to reduce prescription drug prices. That provision could be very popular \u2014 and also reduce Medicare and Medicaid spending, freeing up more money for other parts of the bill. \u201cThe House is on board for a big drug price approach,\u201d Margot says. \u201cBut there is less consensus in the Senate, and, of course, the pharma industry will not go down without a fight.\u201d",
      "The plan includes two major expansions of education. It would make prekindergarten available to every 3- and 4-year-old, likely by subsidizing the state programs that more than half of them already attend. The federal government would also try to make community college universal, by expanding financial aid to cover both tuition and living expenses.",
      "Those provisions have the potential to lift upward mobility by reducing educational inequality, experts say. And several other provisions would immediately reduce poverty. They include:",
      "Democrats plan to pay for the bill\u2019s costs by raising taxes on the affluent. The plan includes increases in the corporate tax rate and the top income tax rate, as well as perhaps a new tax on companies\u2019 overseas profits.",
      "The fight over these taxes is likely to be \u201cthe most fraught part\u201d of the debate, says our colleague Emily Cochrane, who covers Congress. Manchin, for example, has said both that he favors a smaller corporate tax increase than what Biden and top Democrats have proposed \u2014 but also that he wants tax increases to cover the bill\u2019s full costs. That\u2019s one reason the bill could shrink from its current estimated cost of $3.5 trillion.",
      "One other thorny tax issue: Some House members, especially from higher-tax states like New York and New Jersey, want to restore some deductions that largely benefit higher-income households and that Republicans scrapped during the Trump presidency. Why are Democrats pushing for a tax cut that mostly benefits the upper middle class and above? \u201cIt is truly an \u2018all politics is local\u2019 issue,\u201d The Times\u2019s Jim Tankersley says.",
      "House and Senate Democrats will negotiate in the coming weeks. Both chambers could then pass identical bills early this fall and send the legislation to the White House for Biden\u2019s signature \u2014 if Democrats can remain united.",

The fire was only 12 percent contained on Thursday, when authorities ordered evacuations at the edge of the Tahoe basin.",
      "Amid the exodus, which has become a way of life in parts of the West this disaster-filled summer, there has been a creeping concern that the notion of a safe haven is gone, that there soon will be nowhere to run. Everyone from Bay Area billionaires who bought homes along the shores of the lake to workers stunned by surging real estate prices is seeing a sanctuary suffocate.",
      "The smoke and the wildfires that produce it in the West are coming in a time of drought, heat waves, power cuts and, of course, the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "\u201cThis is what climate change looks like,\u201d said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the Nature Conservancy. \u201cIt\u2019s overlapping crises. People try to escape one crisis and stumble into another one.\u201d",
      "With California halfway through its peak fire season, the Caldor fire is only one of about 100 large wildfires burning in the West. The Dixie fire, the second-largest in California history, started more than six weeks ago and now has a perimeter of more than 500 miles. On Wednesday alone, four large new wildfires spread in California, drawing increasingly scarce firefighting resources.",
      "The crisis in Tahoe extends far beyond the smoke on the water and fire in the sky of one tourist attraction. For hundreds of thousands of people living over the mountain from the lake, in the high desert of Nevada, wildfire smoke this summer has closed schools, canceled sports events and led longtime residents to ask how much longer they can hold out.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re beside ourselves here,\u201d said Amy Ginder, 47, who has lived for decades in Reno, which has been besieged for weeks by smoke from the huge Dixie fire to the northwest. \u201cWe have had smoke in the sky literally since the third week of July \u2014 we have been inhaling toxins for five weeks now.

Visiting indoors with friends is out of the question because of the potential for infection from the Covid-19 Delta variant.",

      "From the streets of Kings Beach to the vacation mansions of Incline Village, the lake that Mark Twain once called \u201cthe fairest picture the whole world affords\u201d looks and smells like the bottom of an ashtray.",
      "Early one morning this week on the path that runs along the lake in Tahoe City, Juan Gomez, a parks and recreation employee, marveled at the contrast with last summer, when lakeside towns were swarming with bikers, joggers and shoppers, many of them seeking to outrun the coronavirus.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nobody here,\u201d Mr. Gomez said.",
      "\u201cSo many people bought houses \u2014 they wanted to escape from San Francisco and Sacramento,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they are going back to I don\u2019t know where.\u201d",
      "Parking lots in Tahoe City were nearly empty, and many restaurants and shops were closed because of the smoke. At the south end of the lake, red vacancy signs glittered through the smoky haze on Lake Tahoe Boulevard. There is no problem getting a room in Tahoe this August.",
      "Yet during the pandemic, buying a home here has often meant entering a bidding war. Home values in the Lake Tahoe area have surged more than 30 percent since the pandemic started, according to Zillow, the real estate data company. The average price of a home in Tahoe City is now well above $1 million.",
      "At the Olympic Bike Shop in Tahoe City, the smoke has been both a health hazard and a business setback. Bicycles were in short supply for much of the pandemic, as they have been across the country. But this month, as back-ordered bikes arrived in spades, the shortage was not of bikes but of customers. The shop stopped renting out bikes last week, when the U.S. Forest Service, citing the risk of fires and a lack of personnel, closed parks around the lake through Labor Day.",
      "John Percy, co-owner of the shop, has spent $2,000 on air purifiers, and said the shop is now losing money. Last weekend, he fled to Santa Cruz, 260 miles away on the Pacific Coast, to escape the smoke.",
      "Molly Schildhause, who works the cash register at the shop, was worried about her 11-month-old and planned to stay with her parents in coastal Marin County on her days off.",
      "\u201cI have two air purifiers running in the baby\u2019s room,\u201d she said. \u201cWe keep thinking it\u2019s time to move, but there\u2019s nowhere to go to escape this.\u201d",
      "Mr. Durana, 38, who celebrated last year when he and his partner, Carina Hessmer, managed to buy a small wooden house in South Lake Tahoe, said they decided to leave early this week when the smoke started to give Ms. Hessmer headaches. They cleared some brush from the yard and then headed south toward Los Angeles, where a friend has offered them a spare room.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re grateful for the firefighters,\u201d he said, \u201cand trying not to let our emotions get the best of us.\u201d",
      "The smoke is more serious for Mr. Abernathy, who in addition to scuba diving works in the bike shop three days a week. In 2018 he had half a lung removed to address a birth defect. That had not stopped him from leading a life of outdoor adventure: In March, he made headlines when he used his scuba gear to retrieve a wedding ring that a groom had dropped while exchanging vows on a Lake Tahoe pier.",
      "But the smoke has overwhelmed Mr. Abernathy. He now wears industrial-grade respirators when he is outdoors.",
      "On Tuesday he told Mr. Percy at the bike shop that he would be taking leave until the smoke cleared. He will be staying with his partner\u2019s parents in San Francisco.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t quit easily,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t get away from this smoke.\u201d"

    "title": "Lila Gleitman, Who Showed How Children Learn Language, Dies at 91",
    "content": [
      "Lila Gleitman, whose pioneering work in linguistics and cognitive science expanded our understanding of how language works and how children go about learning it, died on Aug. 8 at a hospital in Philadelphia. She was 91.",
      "Her daughter Claire Gleitman said the cause was a heart attack.",
      "Until the 1970s, most linguists believed that the structure of language existed out in the world, and that the human brain then learned it from infancy. Building on the work of her friend Noam Chomsky, Dr. Gleitman argued the opposite: that the structures, or syntax, of language were hard-wired into the brain from birth, and that children already had a sophisticated grasp of how they work.",
      "\u201cThe study of language acquisition, her primary scientific concern, was her field in a special sense,\u201d Dr. Chomsky said in a statement. \u201cShe virtually created the field in its modern form and led in its impressive development ever since.\u201d",
      "Dr. Chomsky, who like Dr. Gleitman received his doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania, devised the theory. But it was Dr. Gleitman who figured out elegant ways to test it in the real world, starting with her own children.",
      "She liked to recount a story about her daughter Claire, then 2 years old. One day when she was driving and Claire was in the car, Dr. Gleitman took a sharp turn and said, \u201cHold on tight.\u201d Her daughter immediately replied, \u201cIsn\u2019t that tightly?\u201d The utterance showed how even a toddler could understand linguistic nuances, without having been taught them.",
      "Dr. Gleitman called the process \u201csyntactic bootstrapping\u201d \u2014 the use of an innate grasp of linguistic structure and its relationship to meaning to figure out new words.",
      "\u201cThe kid is really partly discovering what he knows from a complex code in which language is hidden,\u201d she said in a 2013 interview.",
      "Dr. Gleitman often collaborated with her husband, the psychologist Henry Gleitman, and with her graduate students, many of whom went on to become leading linguists themselves.",
      "With Barbara Landau, who teaches at Johns Hopkins University, she showed how even blind children were able to learn \u201csighted\u201d words like \u201clook\u201d and \u201csee\u201d \u2014 not by experiencing them in the world, but by inferring their meaning from their syntactic and semantic contexts. She conducted similar research on deaf students with another former student, Susan Goldin-Meadow, now at the University of Chicago.",
      "\u201cShe believed that language learning was not just the accumulation of facts over time, but that it was inherent to who we are as humans,\u201d Dr. Goldin-Meadow said in an interview.",
      "Lila Ruth Lichtenberg was born on Dec. 10, 1929, in the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn. Her father, Ben, was a structural engineer, and her mother, Fanny (Segal) Lichtenberg, was a homemaker.",
      "Lila attended James Madison High School, which educated generations of Brooklyn\u2019s Jews, including Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Senators Chuck Schumer and Bernie Sanders, the economist Gary Becker and Judith Sheindlin, best known as television\u2019s Judge Judy.",
      "She graduated from Antioch College in Ohio with a degree in literature in 1952 and moved to New York, where she took a job as an editorial assistant at the Journal of the American Water Works Association. A few years later she married Eugene Galanter, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, and moved to Philadelphia. That marriage ended in divorce.",
      "She married Dr. Gleitman, at the time a professor at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, in 1958. He died in 2015. Along with her daughter Claire, she is survived by another daughter, Ellen Luchette, and four grandchildren.",
      "As a faculty wife, Dr. Gleitman could take courses at no cost, and she immersed herself in the classics. But she found her studies boring, except for Greek and Latin.",
      "She entered a doctoral track in linguistics, studying under Zellig Harris, himself a pioneer in the computational study of language, analyzing its deep structures and logic. She also took a job at the Eastern Pennsylvania Psychiatric Institute, where part of her work involved writing entries related to psychology for the next edition of Webster\u2019s Dictionary \u2014 including one for a crude term referring to sexual intercourse, which had never before appeared in the book.",
      "\u201cForever I have taken it as my chief accomplishment in life,\u201d she said in a 2017 interview with Dr. Goldin-Meadow.",
      "Despite becoming one of Dr. Harris\u2019s best students, Dr. Gleitman was increasingly drawn to the work of one of his leading acolytes, Dr. Chomsky, who was in the process of a fundamental break with his mentor.",
      "Human language wasn\u2019t something that existed separate from the human mind, Dr. Chomsky argued; rather, it was innate, hard-wired, already there at birth. Dr. Gleitman agreed, and likewise broke with Dr. Harris \u2014 a split so bitter that he refused to oversee her dissertation.",
      "Nevertheless, Dr. Gleitman received her doctorate in 1967 and began teaching at Swarthmore. She returned to the University of Pennsylvania in 1972 and remained there until her retirement in 2002.",
      "She did not, however, stop working. In fact, the last two decades of her life were some of her most intellectually fertile.",
      "Working with a colleague, John Trueswell, Dr. Gleitman studied first how children learn \u201chard\u201d words \u2014 verbs, conceptual nouns \u2014 and then turned around and looked at how they learn concrete nouns and other \u201ceasy\u201d words, which she argued were not as easy as they might seem.",
      "Dr. Gleitman continued to produce new work in recent years, even after macular degeneration left her nearly blind. Dr. Trueswell said that the last email he received from her arrived the day before she died. It was a short note catching him up on her latest paper. She had just submitted it for publication."

    "title": "Parole Board Recommends Release of Sirhan Sirhan, Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s Assassin",
    "content": [
      "California parole commissioners recommended on Friday that Sirhan B. Sirhan should be freed on parole after spending more than 50 years in prison for assassinating Robert F. Kennedy during his campaign for president.",
      "The recommendation from the two commissioners does not necessarily mean Mr. Sirhan, 77, will walk free, but it most likely puts his fate in the hands of Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat facing a recall election that will determine his political future. A spokeswoman for Mr. Newsom declined to say whether he would approve the recommendation, only that he would consider the case after it is reviewed by the parole board\u2019s lawyers.",
      "The parole hearing was the 16th time Mr. Sirhan had faced parole board commissioners, but it was the first time no prosecutor showed up to argue for his continued imprisonment. George Gasc\u00f3n, the progressive and divisive Los Angeles County district attorney who was elected last year, has made it a policy for prosecutors not to attend parole hearings, saying the parole board has all the facts it needs to make an informed decision.",
      "At the hearing, which was conducted virtually because of the coronavirus pandemic, Mr. Sirhan said he had little memory of the assassination itself, but he said he \u201cmust have\u201d brought the gun to the scene.",
      "\u201cI take responsibility for taking it in and I take responsibility for firing the shots,\u201d he said. Mr. Sirhan, much of his short hair turned white, was seated in front of a computer and was wearing a blue uniform with a paper towel in his chest pocket.",
      "Shortly after midnight on June 5, 1968, Kennedy gave a speech at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles following his victory in the Democratic primary in California. As Kennedy, a senator from New York, walked through the hotel\u2019s pantry, Mr. Sirhan shot him with a revolver. Five other people around Kennedy were shot as well, but they all survived.",
      "Kennedy died the next day, less than five years after President John F. Kennedy, one of his brothers, had been assassinated.",
      "Mr. Sirhan, who is Palestinian and was born in Jerusalem, said in a television interview from prison in 1989 that he had killed Kennedy because he felt betrayed by the senator\u2019s proposal during the campaign to send 50 military planes to Israel.",
      "Robert Barton, one of the parole commissioners, said laws passed since Mr. Sirhan\u2019s last hearing in 2016 required the commission to consider new factors, including his age at the time of his crime and his current health. Mr. Barton also said that Mr. Sirhan had improved himself by going to various classes in prison.",
      "Douglas Kennedy, one of Kennedy\u2019s sons, attended the hearing on Friday and urged the commissioners to release Mr. Sirhan, a Jordanian citizen who would likely be deported, if they did not think he was a threat.",
      "\u201cI do have some love for you,\u201d he told Mr. Sirhan at one point, who nodded and lowered his head.",
      "A majority of Kennedy\u2019s children issued a statement late on Friday opposing Mr. Sirhan\u2019s release, and the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department had submitted a letter to the board that it said was on behalf of the Kennedy family. Mr. Barton said he had also taken into account confidential letters that opposed Mr. Sirhan\u2019s release.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. met with Mr. Sirhan in 2017 and said in a letter to the board that the Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s letter did not speak for him and that he thought Mr. Sirhan should be released. His son Robert F. Kennedy III attended the hearing but did not address the board.",
      "In a telephone interview, Douglas Kennedy, who is a correspondent for Fox News, said his family was split over Mr. Sirhan\u2019s release. Emphasizing that he was speaking only for himself, he said he believed that Mr. Newsom should follow the recommendation of the parole board and release Mr. Sirhan.",
      "He also said that seeing Mr. Sirhan at the hearing had made him feel more compassion for him.",
      "\u201cI spent my life sort of avoiding words like \u2018killed,\u2019 \u2018assassin,\u2019 \u2018assassination,\u2019 and Sirhan\u2019s name in general,\u201d said Mr. Kennedy, who was 1 at the time of his father\u2019s assassination. \u201cSo I\u2019m grateful for today\u2019s hearing just to demystify some of that.\u201d",
      "In Friday\u2019s statement, six of Kennedy\u2019s nine surviving children said they were \u201cdevastated\u201d by the recommendation that Mr. Sirhan be released.",
      "They had largely avoided engaging in the parole process because of how traumatic their father\u2019s death had been, they said, but felt compelled to denounce the recommendation, which they said caused \u201cenormous additional pain.\u201d",
      "The siblings urged the full parole board or Mr. Newsom to reverse the decision. \u201cIt is a recommendation we intend to challenge every step of the way,\u201d they said.",
      "Many of the questions at the hearing focused on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and Mr. Sirhan at one point began crying when he spoke about refugees suffering in the Middle East.",
      "\u201cWhatever I would want to do in the future, it would be towards resolving that peacefully,\u201d he said, but he also added that he wanted to \u201cdisengage\u201d from the conflict because he was too old.",
      "An odd coalition has urged prison officials to release Mr. Sirhan over the years, including those who say Mr. Sirhan has served his time and others who believe he is not the real assassin.",
      "Though several investigations have determined that Mr. Sirhan was the lone gunman, and Mr. Sirhan has said the same, some have pursued a conspiracy theory that claims there was a different killer, citing what many say was a sloppy police investigation and varying theories about how many shots were fired and what the ballistic evidence shows.",
      "Two of Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s children have said they support another investigation, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has become a prominent promoter of misleading information about vaccines. He has said he thinks Mr. Sirhan is innocent.",
      "Paul Schrade, a labor organizer who worked on Kennedy\u2019s campaign in 1968 and was one of the several bystanders shot during the assassination, recorded a video that was played for the parole commissioners on Friday, urging Mr. Sirhan\u2019s release based on the theory that he is innocent.",
      "Others argue that there is no need to keep an aging Mr. Sirhan in prison. In 2019, Mr. Sirhan was stabbed by another prisoner, an incident he described on Friday for the first time, saying that the prisoner had crept up on him and cut him in the neck.",
      "Still, many people have opposed his release, saying the crime was heinous and came amid a painful series of assassinations in the 1960s \u2014 including the killing of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. two months earlier.",
      "In 2016, a deputy district attorney in Los Angeles County said prosecutors and the Los Angeles Police Department were unified in believing that \u201cthe seriousness and the gravamen of the crimes committed by this prisoner are too abhorrent to justify his release.\u201d",
      "Mr. Sirhan, who is being held at a prison near San Diego, was convicted of murder and initially sentenced to death. But Mr. Sirhan\u2019s punishment became a life sentence when California\u2019s top court temporarily struck down the state\u2019s death penalty in 1972.",
      "In 1975, prison officials said Mr. Sirhan would be freed on parole in 1986, but that date was later rescinded \u2014 after an outcry \u2014 by a panel that said the officials had erred.",
      "On Friday, Teresa Meighan, the other parole commissioner who reviewed the case, asked Mr. Sirhan if he would be angry if the board recommended parole but it was reversed.",
      "\u201cI would lose a little bit of faith because of the repetition of it, because America\u2019s word is big, and it should hold,\u201d Mr. Sirhan said, adding that when he was first given a parole date in 1975, \u201cto me that was a promise.\u201d",
      "Mr. Sirhan also said he was grateful to have been spared from execution and promised that he would live a peaceful life.",
      "\u201cOver half a century has passed and that young impulsive kid that I was does not exist anymore,\u201d he said.",
      "The decision to grant parole will first be reviewed by the legal division of the Board of Parole Hearings, a process that can take up to about four months. If the lawyers find an error, they can send the case to the full slate of commissioners to review.",
      "If not, then the case will be sent to the governor, who has 30 days to review it. The governor, who has said that Robert F. Kennedy was his hero, can either approve the recommendation, send it back to the parole board, reverse the recommendation or take no action and let it go into effect.",
      "In several instances, Mr. Newsom has denied parole to people whom the parole board has recommended for release, including two followers of the notorious cult leader Charles Manson, most recently in June."

    "content": [
      "As schools return to in-person learning with masks and social distancing, some districts are facing another challenge: getting students to class.",
      "Thousands of school bus drivers were furloughed, fell ill or quit as classes moved online last year because of the coronavirus pandemic, school and union officials said. Now districts across the country are trying to lure them back, offering signing bonuses and juggling schedules and bus routes to make up for the shortfall. One school in Delaware is even paying parents to drive their children to school.",
      "\u201cThere are reports of shortages across the country,\u201d said Joanna McFarland, the chief executive of HopSkipDrive, which works with districts on transportation solutions. \u201cIt is the worst that we have seen in a very long time, if not ever.\u201d",
      "Driver shortages have been an issue for years. After getting a commercial license, some drivers are lured to delivery services and trucking companies, forgoing the split shifts and unruly children that can be part of the job of driving a school bus.",
      "The pandemic made things worse. Many school bus drivers retired or quit out of fear of becoming exposed to the virus in an enclosed space, a risk some new drivers were also reluctant to take. Some quit over mask mandates, while others were furloughed or got sick, further diminishing the pool.",
      "As the start of the 2021-22 academic year approached, officials sounded the alarm. HopSkipDrive, which conducted a national survey of 1,186 transportation and district officials, said that efforts to prepare for the coming school year would be hobbled by the shortages. The National School Transportation Association, which represents bus companies, warned this year that new drivers would not be able to fill the shortfall caused by furloughs and the loss of drivers from the work force.",
      "The training of replacements is not keeping pace. It can take up to eight weeks for a driver to get a commercial license, the association said. Additional training is required for drivers who transport children with special needs and behavioral issues.",
      "The nation\u2019s 13,000 school districts spend about $22 billion on student transportation every year, according to the Amalgamated Transit Union, which represents drivers across the United States and Canada. That pays for about half a million yellow buses that ferry more than 25 million children to and from schools, the union said.",
      "\u201cCovid came and it was the perfect storm,\u201d said John Costa, the international president of the Amalgamated Transit Union.",
      "\u201cIt is a big problem,\u201d he added. \u201cSome had to find other jobs and some retired. Now, 18, 19 months later, schools are coming back\u201d and the drivers \u201care not there.\u201d",
      "Districts are trying to make the job of driving a school bus more attractive, offering signing bonuses and organizing recruiting events to entice new drivers. First Student, a school bus transportation contractor, offered $4,000 to new drivers in Helena, Mont. The company also staged recruiting events that it called \u201cBig Bus, No Big Deal,\u201d during which people were invited to test-drive the massive yellow buses, without dozens of children on board.",
      "\u201cOnce you get up and get in the seat where you sit up high, we have the trainers that are going to ride with them and show them that it\u2019s not hard to drive a school bus \u2014 it\u2019s actually pretty easy,\u201d Dan Redford, a First Student safety manager, told KTVH-TV of Helena last month. The job has been popular with retirees who want to supplement their income and do not mind working split shifts, he said.",
      "Eastside Charter School, a grade school in Wilmington, Del., is paying families $700 for each child they drive to and from school. So far, parents of about 180 students have taken advantage of the incentive, and the number is expected to rise to 250, said Aaron Bass, the school\u2019s chief executive officer. As many as 480 Eastside students need transportation, but the school has only half the bus drivers it needs, he said.",
      "\u201cWe are looking at this as a time to be innovative,\u201d Mr. Bass said. \u201cFind innovation in the midst of chaos and crisis.\u201d",
      "In Georgia, the Savannah-Chatham County Public Schools, which is 114 drivers short, has cut bus routes and prioritized busing for students who attend its schools, leaving families with children in alternative and charter schools to find their own way.",
      "The district is offering $4,000 to new and returning drivers, along with guarantees for more work hours. Savannah is home to one of the nation\u2019s busiest seaports, so the district has always had tough competition for drivers with commercial licenses, said Paul Abbott, the executive director of transportation.",
      "\u201cCovid has completely exacerbated the issue,\u201d Mr. Abbott said. \u201cIt is going to be a long, slow climb out of this. We are conducting interviews like crazy.\u201d",
      "Pittsburgh has increased its signing bonus to $3,500 and is grouping multiple schools on each bus route to cope with a shortage of about 400 drivers, according to Diane Stambaugh, president of Local 1743 of the Amalgamated Transit Union.",
      "\u201cNobody is applying,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd because of Covid they could not have classes, and a lot of people retired, and a lot of people just flat out quit.\u201d",
      "More than half of the respondents to the HopSkipDrive survey, which included school districts with enrollments of 25,000 to 100,000, expected that it would be at least three months before transportation operations returned to normal.",
      "In New York City, which has the nation\u2019s largest public school system, the pandemic was the latest hardship for union drivers who have weathered other challenges in recent years, including a strike in 2013. Michael Cordiello, the president of Local 1181 of the Amalgamated Transit Union, said that 244 drivers had retired so far this year, and that only 220 had been hired, the first time he could remember such a gap.",

      "Hurricane Ida, the rapidly intensifying storm barreling toward Louisiana, could be one of the most powerful to hit the state in more than a century, meteorologists and state officials warned on Saturday.",
      "\u201cWe can sum it up by saying this will be one of the strongest hurricanes to hit anywhere in Louisiana since at least the 1850s,\u201d said Gov. John Bel Edwards at a news conference, warning residents that their window to evacuate the area was closing.",
      "Ida, which passed through the Cayman Islands as a tropical storm and reached Cuba on Friday as a Category 1 hurricane, is causing mass evacuations in Louisiana. Early Sunday, the National Hurricane Center said it had become a Category 3 storm, then upgraded it to Category 4 just an hour later, with maximum sustained winds of 130 m.p.h.",
      "The storm is expected to hit Louisiana later Sunday, the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, as an \u201cextremely dangerous major hurricane,\u201d the center said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very painful to think about another powerful storm like Hurricane Ida making landfall on that anniversary,\u201d Mr. Edwards said on Saturday. \u201cBut I also want you to know that we\u2019re not the same state that we were 16 years ago.\u201d",

The National Hurricane Center said that, depending on the tides, the surge could be as high as 15 feet in Morgan City, La., and reach up to 8 feet in Lake Pontchartrain. A storm surge warning was also issued for the coastal areas in east Alabama and Florida.",

      "\u201cPreparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion today in the warning area along the northern Gulf Coast,\u201d the center said.",
      "By Saturday evening, Ida had maximum sustained winds of 105 miles per hour, making it a Category 2 hurricane, the National Hurricane Center said.",
      "\u201cThe strengthening process is definitely in full swing,\u201d said Dennis Feltgen, communications officer with the National Hurricane Center.",
      "The crucial question, for residents and emergency authorities along the Gulf Coast, is how much stronger it will become before making landfall in the United States.",
      "Mr. Edwards declared a state of emergency on Thursday, and Gov. Kay Ivey of Alabama issued a state of emergency for the state\u2019s coastal and western counties on Saturday, saying local officials expected \u201cthe possibility of flooding and even spinoff tornadoes in portions of Alabama.\u201d In Mississippi, Gov. Tate Reeves also issued a state of emergency on Saturday, allowing for the use of state resources for response and recovery.",
      "Research over the past decade has found that, on average, such rapid intensification of hurricanes is increasing, in part because the oceans, which provide the energy for hurricanes, are getting warmer as a result of human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases. But Ida will also strengthen quickly because the Gulf, as is usual at the end of the summer, is very warm.",
      "The hurricane center defines rapid intensification as at least a 35-m.p.h. increase in sustained winds over 24 hours. In the extremely active 2020 season, Hurricane Laura intensified by 45 m.p.h. in the 24 hours before making landfall in Louisiana as a Category 4 storm in late August.",
      "The National Hurricane Center said Ida was likely to produce heavy rainfall late Sunday into Monday from southeast Louisiana to coastal Mississippi and Alabama. Tropical storm force winds will arrive along the coast as early as Saturday night, according to the National Weather Service, before the storm makes landfall on Sunday afternoon or evening. After moving inland, the storm could contribute to flooding in Tennessee, where flash flooding killed 20 people last weekend.",
      "\u201cBased upon current track and strength of Ida, this storm will test our hurricane protection systems in a way they haven\u2019t been tested before,\u201d Chip Kline, executive assistant to the governor of Louisiana for coastal activities, said on Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s times like these that remind us of the importance of continuing to protect south Louisiana.\u201d"

    "title": "Coronavirus Briefing: What Happened Today",
    "content": [
      "Throughout most of the coronavirus pandemic, Oregon has been a success story, ranking 46th in the nation in deaths per capita as it maintained some of the country\u2019s most stringent restrictions.",
      "But the state is now recording more cases each day than at any point in the pandemic and hospitalizations have reached a new peak, fueled by counties where only about one-third of residents have been vaccinated.",
      "To quell the surge, Gov. Kate Brown has issued a mandate that will take effect on Friday, requiring that both vaccinated and unvaccinated people wear masks, even when gathering outdoors. That goes well beyond what any other state has done in battling this year\u2019s summer surge.",
      "She said in an interview that more restrictions may be needed as the coming days unfold and the state tries to keep in-person schooling on track.",
      "Brown told my colleagues Sergio Olmos and Mike Baker that in some states that largely contained the virus early in the pandemic there is little natural immunity in the population. She said she doesn\u2019t see the most draconian restrictions of last year \u2014 such as closing restaurants and limiting gatherings \u2014 as being as effective when there are two easy and effective tools available: masks and vaccinations.",
      "Ms. Brown has not imposed the kind of restrictions that were in place when the virus, arguably, was less dangerous than it is now: She has not prohibited indoor dining or large public gatherings and the state is resuming in-person instruction at most public schools, unless they face serious outbreaks.",
      "That has largely left local leaders and businesses \u2014 and individuals themselves \u2014 to figure out how to navigate the hazardous new terrain.",
      "In the state\u2019s largest city, Mayor Ted Wheeler of Portland was among those endorsing new mandates on face coverings.",
      "A week after he took to Twitter to ask residents to follow the guidelines by wearing a mask at all times indoors, he gathered for a party in the eighth-floor lounge of a downtown hotel. Photos obtained by The New York Times show him sitting with about a dozen people \u2014 almost all unmasked \u2014 testing the limits of the strict new mask rules.",
      "Lennox Wiseley, a spokesman for Wheeler, said the mayor and his staff were complying with the rules because they were \u201cactively eating and/or drinking\u201d \u2014 the state standard for when people can remove their masks indoors.",
      "After weeks of stagnation, the U.S. vaccination campaign has picked up some steam. \u201cThe reason why we\u2019ve seen the marked increase in demand is fear, it\u2019s the Delta variant,\u201d said the head of Arkansas\u2019s vaccination effort.",
      "The increase in vaccinations has been especially pronounced in states where immunization levels were below the national average of 61 percent. Many of those states have felt the effects of the Delta-led fourth wave most acutely.",
      "Some state officials say they are adjusting their messaging to focus on the stories of people who have experienced Covid-19 illness or death firsthand.",
      "North Dakota is developing an \u201cImpact Wall,\u201d a website with a collection of videos and photos from those who have been sick or lost a loved one.",
      "And Arkansas has produced a televised public service announcement featuring a pregnant woman who had a near-death experience with Covid. In the video, she and her husband encourage Arkansans to get vaccinated.",
      "Public health experts continue to believe that Covid cases are relatively uncommon among people who are vaccinated, and rarely result in severe illness or hospitalizations.",
      "In a recent analysis of state-level data, 90 percent of cases resulting in hospitalization or death occurred among patients who were not fully vaccinated. But breakthroughs are indisputably happening, and some people who have been through it shared their stories with The Times:",
      "See how the vaccine rollout is going in your county and state.",
      "I am despondent at times. It was bad enough when we were waiting for a vaccine that would slam dunk end the crisis. But, I learned some things the first time around. I am 71 and attending two classes on zoom. I don\u2019t get \u201cstuck\u201d on the phone looking up COVID symptoms. Check my phone three times a day for welcomed messages from friends. Try to do something each day to help myself in four areas: Intellectually, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Sometimes I draw a pie and illustrate what I will do each day in each divided area. \u2014 Lizabeth L. Nackson, Louisville, Ky.",
      "Let us know how you\u2019re dealing with the pandemic. Send us a response here, and we may feature it in an upcoming newsletter.",

    "title": "New York\u2019s Private Schools Tackle White Privilege. It Has Not Been Easy.",
    "content": [
      "Several years back Grace Church School, an elite private school in Manhattan, embraced an antiracist mission and sought to have students and teachers wrestle with whiteness, racial privilege and bias.",
      "Teachers and students were periodically separated into groups by race, gender and ethnicity. In February 2021, Paul Rossi, a math teacher, and what the school called his \u201cwhite-identifying\u201d group, met with a white consultant, who displayed a slide that named supposed characteristics of white supremacy. These included individualism, worship of the written word and objectivity.",
      "Mr. Rossi said he felt a twist in his stomach. \u201cObjectivity?\u201d he told the consultant, according to a transcript. \u201cHuman attributes are being reduced to racial traits.\u201d",
      "As you look at this list, the consultant asked, are you having \u201cwhite feelings\u201d?",
      "\u201cWhat,\u201d Mr. Rossi asked, \u201cmakes a feeling \u2018white\u2019?\u201d",
      "Some of the high school students then echoed his objections. \u201cI\u2019m so exhausted with being reduced to my race,\u201d a girl said. \u201cThe first step of antiracism is to racialize every single dimension of my identity.\u201d Another girl added: \u201cFighting indoctrination with indoctrination can be dangerous.\u201d",
      "This modest revolt proved fateful. A school official reprimanded Mr. Rossi, accusing him of \u201ccreating a neurological imbalance\u201d in students, according to a recording of the conversation. A few days later the head of school wrote a statement and directed teachers to read it aloud in classes.",
      "\u201cWhen someone breaches our professional norms,\u201d the statement read in part, \u201cthe response includes a warning in their permanent file that a further incident of unprofessional conduct could result in dismissal.\u201d",
      "This is another dispatch from America\u2019s cultural conflicts over schools, this time from a rarefied bubble. Elite private schools from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C., from Boston to Columbus, Ohio, have embraced a mission to end racism by challenging white privilege. A sizable group of parents and teachers say the schools have taken it too far \u2014 and enforced suffocating and destructive groupthink on students.",
      "This is nowhere more true than in New York City\u2019s tony forest of private schools.",
      "Stirred by the surge of activism around racism, Black alumni have shared tales of isolation, insensitivity and racism during school days.",
      "And many private school administrators have tried to reimagine their schools as antiracist institutions, which means, loosely, a school that is actively opposed to any manifestation of racism.",
      "This conflict plays out amid the high peaks of American economic inequality. Tuition at many of New York\u2019s private schools hovers between $53,000 and $58,000, the most expensive tab in the nation. Many heads of school make between $580,000 to more than $1.1 million.",
      "At a time when some public schools are battling over whether to even teach aspects of American history, private school administrators portray uprooting racial bias as morally urgent and demanding of reiteration. Some steps are practical: They have added Black, Latino and Asian authors, and expanded course offerings to better encompass America and the world in its complications.",
      "Other steps are much more personal. The interim head of the Dalton School, Ellen Stein, who is white, spoke five years ago of writing a racial biography of herself to better understand biases and to communicate with \u201cother races.\u201d The Brearley School declared itself an antiracist school with mandatory antiracism training for parents, faculty and trustees and affirmed the importance of meeting regularly in groups that bring together people who share a common race or gender.",
      "Kindergarten students at Riverdale Country School in the Bronx are taught to identify their skin color by mixing paint colors. The lower school chief in an email last year instructed parents to avoid talk of colorblindness and \u201cacknowledge racial differences.\u201d",
      "Private school leaders, along with diversity consultants, say these approaches reflect current research about confronting racism and stamping out privilege.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s always the same resistance \u2014 \u2018Oh my God, you\u2019re going too far,\u2019\u201d said Martha Haakmat, a Black diversity consultant who serves on the board of Brearley. \u201cWe just want to teach kids about the systems that create inequity in society and empower them rather than reinforcing systems of oppression.\u201d",
      "Studies show that very young children, she said, are aware of skin color. Better to address it \u2014 \u201cYes, that woman has Black skin. What do you think of that?\u201d \u2014 than to let children view white skin as the baseline.",
      "More broadly, Ms. Haakmat said, private schools need to sidestep white old boy networks in hiring and integrate antiracism into the curriculum: If you teach statistics, why not touch on economic and racial inequality? Or use biology classes to teach of eugenics and how race has framed the way we think of humans? That, she said, \u201cis thoughtful antiracism.\u201d",
      "Critics, a mixed lot of parents and teachers, argue that aspects of the new curriculums edge toward recreating the racially segregated spaces of an earlier age. They say the insistent emphasis on skin color and race is reductive and some teenagers learn to adopt the language of antiracism and wield it against peers.",
      "The nerves of some parents were not soothed when more than 100 teachers and staff members applauded Dalton\u2019s antiracism curriculum and proposed two dozen steps to extend it, including calling on the school to abolish any advanced course in which Black students performed worse than students who are not Black.",
      "A group of Dalton parents wrote their own letter to the school this year: \u201cWe have spoken with dozens of families of all colors and backgrounds who are in shock and looking for an alternative school.\u201d",
      "This upswell of parental anger, fed also by discontent with Dalton\u2019s decision to teach only online last fall, led the head of school, Jim Best, who is white, to leave on July 1. Dalton\u2019s diversity chief resigned under fire in February.",
      "Bion Bartning, who notes that his heritage is a mix of Jewish, Mexican and Yaqui tribe, pulled his children out of Riverdale and created a foundation to argue against this sort of antiracist education. \u201cThe insistence on teaching race consciousness is a fundamental shift into a sort of tribalism,\u201d he said.",
      "No head of school agreed to an interview. Those at Dalton, Riverdale and Grace Church answered some questions by email. Several dozen faculty members declined interviews; in the end six spoke only on the condition of anonymity, for fear of upsetting employers. A dozen parents at five schools agreed to interviews, only one on the record.",
      "For parents to speak out, said a white mother of private school children, was laden with risk. \u201cPeople and companies are petrified of being labeled racists,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you work at an elite Wall Street firm and speak out, a top partner will tell you to shut up.\u201d",
      "Another parent framed the primal class stakes: Wealthy parents plot and compete to get a child into a private school secure in the knowledge that education married to social connections will ease the way into an elite college and a gilded career. A letter or call from the counselor at a top private school can work wonders with college admissions offices.",
      "Why risk all that?",
      "The stories make for disturbing reading. In the wake of the police killing of George Floyd, Black private school alumni formed Instagram accounts: @blackattrinity, @blackatdalton, @blackatbrearley, @blackatandover and @blackatsidwellfriends.",
      "The posts are anonymous and difficult to fact-check. But the ache and hurt are inescapable. A Black student recalled a white peer who told him Dalton \u201cwasn\u2019t made for people like you anyway.\u201d A Black graduate of Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School recalled wealthy white classmates who complained Black students only got into certain colleges because of their race. A Black Brearley graduate wrote of being conditioned to believe \u201cwhite skin, straight hair, a skinny body and money was the only way I could be right in this world.\u201d",
      "Stories come laden with complication. Students wrote of favorite teachers and treasured experiences. And there were traces of class anger. A Black working-class parent at Trinity School wrote that wealthy Black families dominated the Black affinity group and excluded her child.",
      "These kinds of stories, taken together with shifts in the culture around racism, persuaded private school leaders to double down on antiracist education. Such efforts extend back more than four decades.",
      "\u201cAs schools got used to diversity they realized it enriched education for all students,\u201d said Ms. Haakmat, the consultant. \u201cBut these schools were still way white.\u201d",
      "New York\u2019s private schools declined to provide the demographic breakdowns that are required of public schools. Riverdale and Trinity officials say about 40 percent of students identify as of color, a quite broad definition; Grace officials say 33 percent of students hail from \u201cdiverse backgrounds\u201d; Dalton said only that it had a \u201cstrong commitment to being intentionally diverse.\u201d Riverdale\u2019s head of school, Dominic Randolph, said a precise count was complicated by the number of families identifying as multiracial.",
      "Numbers compiled by the Guild of Independent Schools of New York City showed that the percentage of students in elite private schools who identified as Black or Latino remained static since 2013, hovering at a combined 12 percent; Black and Latino residents constitute more than 50 percent of the city\u2019s population.",
      "Lisa Johnson is a graduate of a private school in Atlanta and heads Private School Village, a Los Angeles-based organization for Black families. \u201cThey love to pitch you on diversity,\u201d she said. \u201cThen your child is one of two Blacks in a class and you think, \u2018Huh, how do they define diversity without crystal-clear data?\u2019\u201d",
      "Chlo\u00e9 Valdary, a Black diversity consultant who diverges from her peers and is critical of aspects of antiracist education, noted that heated rhetoric rarely challenged the status quo. \u201cAntiracism sidesteps income inequality and doesn\u2019t actually threaten the elite at all,\u201d she said.",
      "Several teachers spoke of a performance-like quality to heated rhetoric on antiracism and pointed by way of example to Dalton, which throws an annual diversity conference that attracts trustees, parents and donors from 30 private schools. The conference this May carried intrigue, with Dalton\u2019s head of school, Mr. Best, speaking of his confusion at being pushed out, saying, \u201cNo one here, including me, has the full story.\u201d",
      "Mr. Best introduced the keynote speaker, Rodney Glasgow, a Black diversity consultant who leads a private Quaker school in Maryland. Mr. Glasgow, a popular speaker on the private school circuit, promptly laid waste to that world, describing it as laden with \u201cinsidious\u201d whiteness and \u201cbuilt to replicate the plantation mentality.\u201d",
      "Mr. Glasgow ended with a flourish, comparing those Dalton parents who pushed out Mr. Best to what he described as the white supremacists who invaded the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. Dalton featured his speech prominently on its website until questions arose. It has since been removed.",
      "Paul Rossi and Grace Church School\u2019s journey into antiracist education offers a window into its complexities. Mr. Rossi, 52, changed careers in his early 40s, and found at Grace \u2014 an Episcopal school with liberal values \u2014 a place he adored. He taught math and classes on existentialism and Stoic philosophy. Records show he received strong annual evaluations and was described as a natural teacher.",
      "Slowly change came. The head of school, George P. Davison, who is white and has steered Grace for many years, pinpointed the moment his school embraced an antiracist mission.",
      "\u201cGrace began using the language of antiracism in 2015 as part of our efforts to foster a sense of belonging,\u201d he wrote in response to The New York Times. \u201cIt means believing that racism is real, that opposing it requires active engagement and that our community and curriculum are enriched when we aren\u2019t blind to race\u2019s influence.\u201d",
      "Grace, he wrote, incorporated the language of critical race theory but did not rest upon that foundation. He emphasized that the school avoided using shame around race.",
      "Mr. Rossi, along with two teachers who described themselves as progressives and asked for anonymity, was skeptical. The teachers acknowledged that quite a few colleagues appeared to support the new curriculum and they spoke of sustained pressure to demonstrate acceptance of the language of antiracism.",
      "Last year, the @blackatgrace Instagram account anonymously accused a female administrator of once placing derogatory information in a Black student\u2019s file. A teacher circulated a petition demanding her firing.",
      "Another teacher grew worried; he had not known of the petition and feared the absence of his signature would be taken as a sign of his insensitivity. \u201cI thought to myself: We\u2019ve entered a culture of denunciation,\u201d Mr. Rossi said. \u201cWe don\u2019t just denounce but if we don\u2019t do it fast enough, we could be denounced.\u201d",
      "Pressure to join affinity groups went \u201cbeyond \u2018highly encouraged,\u2019\u201d teachers said. A Latino couple asked a teacher to stop pressuring their daughter, who did not want to join the Latino one.",
      "Grace administrators agreed to demands to seek more diverse faculty; it is largely white.",
      "With the election of Donald J. Trump, teachers said, permissible disagreement narrowed markedly. Mr. Rossi recalled some students in his \u201cThe Art of Persuasion\u201d class hankered for contrarian readings outside what he called the \u201cGrace political bubble.\u201d So last autumn he proposed a work by Glenn Loury, a well-known economist at Brown University and a Black man with conservative leanings.",
      "An administrator, Hugo Mahabir, whose family has roots in Trinidad, blocked that. He wrote in an email to Mr. Rossi that Mr. Loury\u2019s argument \u2014 delivered to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology economics faculty \u2014 \u201crings hollow,\u201d and that to give students a Black conservative view on race might \u201cconfuse and/or enflame students.\u201d Mr. Mahabir did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The transcript of the February session with Mr. Rossi\u2019s white affinity group revealed a tense, probing discussion, with teachers and students found on either side of various questions. Toward the end, the dean of student life, Ilana Laurence, offered thanks: \u201cAs uncomfortable as Mr. Rossi may have made many people here, I firmly believe that our conversation would not ever have been nearly as rich and thought-provoking.\u201d",
      "This drew support from the consultant, Emily Schorr Lesnick, who ran the affinity session. At a faculty meeting a few days later, she noted that Mr. Rossi and fellow teachers modeled an intelligent discussion.",
      "\u201cI have been in lots of spaces with adults, with students around antiracist work,\u201d she said, where white people are \u201ckind of just saying things and going through the motions and this was not that space, and I am so so grateful.\u201d Ms. Schorr Lesnick, who is white, did not respond to a request for an interview.",
      "That air of congratulation dissipated. Soon Mr. Rossi talked with Mr. Davison, the school head, about the dim shape of his future. He secretly recorded that conversation.",
      "It offered a surprise. \u201cThe fact is that I\u2019m agreeing with you that there has been a demonization,\u201d Mr. Davison told the teacher. \u201cI also have grave doubts about some of the doctrinaire stuff that gets spouted at us in the name of antiracist.\u201d",
      "Mr. Davison said he was worried students were made to feel shame because of race. \u201cWe\u2019re demonizing white people for being born,\u201d he said, adding later, \u201cWe\u2019re using language that makes them feel less than, for nothing that they are personally responsible.\u201d",
      "Mr. Rossi wrote of his case on the Substack site of the writer Bari Weiss, a former Times Opinion editor. In an email to Mr. Rossi, Mr. Davison claimed he was misquoted. The teacher later released recorded excerpts from that conversation, after which Grace claimed that the quotes lacked context.",
      "Mr. Rossi was denounced at Grace and in private school circles. He rejoined that he was trapped, accused of racial insensitivity and in danger of losing his job.",
      "This drama occurred against a backdrop of tension at the school. Months earlier, nine Black students demanded that classes be called off in the wake of Mr. Floyd\u2019s death. They said peers were \u201cvoicing their white opinions about how Black and brown people should protest.\u201d",
      "The Grace Gazette, the school newspaper, surveyed 111 students and staff this spring of all backgrounds about free speech.",
      "By a margin of about 48 percent to 43 percent, respondents said they were uncomfortable expressing dissenting opinions. And 35 percent said they had practiced \u201cwokeness\u201d to protect their reputations. \u201cThere is no viewpoint diversity on race,\u201d a student wrote, \u201cbecause everyone is expected to view things the same way.\u201d",
      "The pushback against antiracism education has taken on aspects of an ideological uprising. In Boston, a new group, Parents United, has entered the fight with New England\u2019s private schools. Mr. Bartning, the former Riverdale parent, established the Foundation Against Intolerance & Racism, with a large board that includes the academic and writer Steven Pinker; the human rights activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali; the former Fox newscaster Megyn Kelly; and Mr. Loury, the economist at Brown. Mr. Rossi works with this foundation.",
      "Grace Church School appointed a task force to re-examine its antiracist teachings.",
      "But the schools seem unlikely to change their approach to educating students on race. And opponents face daunting challenges. Powerful trustees say they support the schools, and administrators sound steeled for the argument. Tom Taylor, the head of Riverdale\u2019s Upper School, who is white, recently published an academic article on race and private schools. He, too, is a product of such schools.",
      "Private schools perpetuate whiteness, he wrote, and must pursue an \u201cantiracist, decolonizing and culturally affirming\u201d agenda, with no obligation to educate those who resist. \u201cPrivate schools who find parents unwilling to accept moves toward a culturally responsible school are free to draw a line,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Mr. Rossi, the Grace schoolteacher, will watch from the outside. Grace Church School offered him a contract if he participated in \u201crestorative practices\u201d for the supposed harm done to students of color. Grace officials did not explain what that would entail.",
      "Soon after, Mr. Rossi and the school parted ways. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer the school I loved,\u201d he said."

    "content": [
      "President Biden, who has pledged to fight the coronavirus pandemic by making the United States the \u201carsenal of vaccines\u201d for the world, is under increasing criticism from public health experts, global health advocates and even Democrats in Congress who say he is nowhere near fulfilling his promise.",
      "Mr. Biden has either donated or pledged about 600 million vaccine doses to other countries \u2014 a small fraction of the 11 billion that experts say are needed to slow the spread of the virus worldwide. His administration has also taken steps to expand Covid-19 vaccine manufacturing in the United States and India, and is supporting production in South Africa and Senegal to expand access to locally produced vaccines in Africa.",
      "But with the administration now recommending booster doses for vaccinated Americans starting next month, outraged public health experts and many Democrats on Capitol Hill are calling on the president to move more aggressively to scale up global manufacturing. In an analysis published on Thursday, the AIDS advocacy group PrEP4All found that the administration had spent less than 1 percent of the money that Congress appropriated for ramping up Covid-19 countermeasures on expanding vaccine manufacturing.",
      "Congress put a total of $16.05 billion in the American Rescue Plan this year, in two separate tranches, that could be used to procure and manufacture treatments, vaccines and tools for ending the pandemic. But PrEP4All found that all told, the administration had spent $145 million \u2014 just $12 million of it from the American Rescue Plan \u2014 to expand vaccine manufacturing.",
      "The United States has donated 115 million surplus doses, and has purchased 500 million more from Pfizer and BioNTech to be distributed through Covax, more than any other country. But that is still a minute fraction of the 12 billion doses Duke University\u2019s Global Health Innovation Center predicts the world needs by the end of 2021.",
      "James Krellenstein, a founder of PrEP4All and the author of its report, said \u201cif they don\u2019t change course pretty soon, the Biden administration is going to be remembered in terms that the Reagan administration is remembered today in not dealing with the AIDS crisis.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 More than 70,700 people had been evacuated from Afghanistan as of Tuesday evening. Nearly 6,000 American troops are protecting the international airport in Kabul, the capital. And additional U.S. flights are leaving every 45 minutes.",
      "The Biden administration has provided a stream of updates about its airlift of Americans, Afghans and others since Aug. 14, when the Taliban closed in on Kabul. Yet U.S. officials are reluctant to offer an estimate of the one number that matters most: How many people ultimately need to be rescued.",
      "That tally has never been more critical, with the American government preparing to wind down evacuations as the U.S. military begins its final withdrawal from Afghanistan. On Tuesday, President Biden reaffirmed his plan to remove all American troops by Aug. 31, although he left room \u201cto adjust the timeline should that become necessary.\u201d",
      "But U.S. officials believe that thousands of Americans remain in Afghanistan, including some far beyond Kabul, without a safe or fast way to get to the airport. Tens of thousands of Afghans who worked for the U.S. government over the last 20 years, and are eligible for special visas, are desperate to leave.",
      "And refugee and resettlement experts estimate that at least 300,000 Afghans are in imminent danger of being targeted by the Taliban for associating with Americans and U.S. efforts to stabilize Afghanistan.",
      "Recounting his conversations with other world leaders, Mr. Biden said Tuesday evening at the White House that they had agreed to \u201ccontinue our close cooperation to get people out as efficiently and safely as possible.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re currently on a pace to finish by August the 31st,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cThe sooner we can finish the better.\u201d",
      "But other senior U.S. officials doubt the evacuations will be complete by then.",
      "\u201cAmericans want us to stay until we get our people out, and so do our allies,\u201d Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, said Tuesday. Mr. Biden, he added, should \u201ctell the Taliban we\u2019re getting our people out however long it takes.\u201d",
      "Administration officials say the numbers are changing on an hourly basis, if not minute-to-minute, especially since other countries have their own evacuation operations.",
      "But the American effort is unquestionably the largest. Given the resources and risk the United States is putting into the evacuation, how can the government not know how many people it is planning to fly out?",
      "\u201cVery good question! We are wondering the same,\u201d said James Miervaldis, the chairman of No One Left Behind, a nonprofit that advocates the relocation of Afghan interpreters to the United States.",
      "Here is what we know.",
      "Sort of.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in Kabul is contacting Americans who are believed to be in Afghanistan \u2014 officials say there may be thousands \u2014 and offering them safe passage to the airport in Kabul to fly out. But the alerts are going only to Americans who provided the government their location before Kabul fell or in the week since.",
      "The situation has led to U.S. officials combing through databases that may be vastly outdated or undercount the number of U.S. citizens in the country. One Biden administration official said most Americans in Afghanistan are dual citizens, and may have never registered with the embassy or otherwise advised the U.S. government of their whereabouts.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s our responsibility to find them, which we are now doing hour by hour,\u201d Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden\u2019s national security adviser, said on Monday. \u201cIn the days remaining, we believe we have the wherewithal to get out the American citizens who want to leave Kabul.\u201d",
      "More than 4,000 American citizens, plus their family members, have been evacuated so far, a senior State Department official said on Tuesday. Thousands more remain: A day earlier, a congressional official put the total number of U.S. citizens still in Afghanistan at 10,000. It was not clear how many of the 4,000 who have been evacuated were included in that tally.",
      "First, some history on the so-called S.I.V. program.",
      "In 2009, Congress approved special refuge for Afghans who had worked for the American military and U.S. Embassy as interpreters, translators, advisers and other jobs during the war, and who could be targeted by the Taliban or other extremists for assisting the United States.",
      "The International Rescue Committee estimates there are tens of thousands of Afghans who are eligible for the special visas. But only about 16,000 Afghans have received the special visas since 2014, and the State Department faced a backlog of more than 17,000 applications when Mr. Biden took office in January.",
      "Between mid-July and Aug. 14, the State Department evacuated about 2,000 Afghans who qualified for the visas. After a several-day pause last week while the Biden administration focused on evacuating American citizens and embassy staff, flights have resumed for the former Afghan employees; the first plane load of special immigration visa holders since Kabul fell departed Ramstein Air Base in Germany early Monday and headed to the United States.",
      "One congressional aide said the Biden administration had identified about 50,000 special visa applicants, and their families, to be evacuated. But the aide said far more were eligible.",
      "Sunil Varghese, the policy director for the International Refugee Assistance Project, said it was not clear how many Afghans qualified for the program \u2014 largely because the Pentagon and State Department had done a poor job of coordinating and communicating with each other about who had worked for each agency.",
      "And without a centralized U.S. government database to track former employees in Afghanistan, it fell to the Afghans to prove they had worked for the United States, Mr. Varghese said.",
      "Far from it. The administration acknowledges that there are hundreds of thousands of Afghans who are considered at high risk of being targeted by the Taliban \u2014 former Afghan security forces, government officials, journalists, judges and prosecutors, and women rights advocates among them.",
      "The State Department said it had accelerated its referrals of Afghans at high risk to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. That program, however, would generally require Afghans to apply through the United Nations\u2019 refugee agency and await approval \u2014 a process that can take years.",
      "As of Friday, the State Department was planning to accept up to 50,000 Afghans into the United States under a humanitarian parole \u2014 meaning they would be temporarily settled at military bases until their visas were processed, according to a memo provided by a resettlement worker.",
      "\u201cThis caseload would be separate from \u2014 and additional to \u2014 the Afghan refugee or S.I.V. cases who will also continue to be admitted,\u201d according to the memo, which was confirmed by a person familiar with it who said even 50,000 was a vast undercounting of those in need. The State Department declined to comment.",
      "One administration official said the number of people who needed to be evacuated could be more than 100,000. The International Rescue Committee has a much higher estimate: 300,000 Afghan civilians alone.",
      "Not likely. The evacuation mission is widely expected to slow to a trickle once the U.S. military exits. Without the protection of the 6,000 American troops in Kabul, the military airlift will end, and State Department charter flights will slow, and could altogether cease. Additionally, some other foreign governments have said they would have little choice but to also depart.",
      "The Biden administration is warning the Taliban, which wants international aid to Afghanistan to continue, to allow Afghans to leave the country \u2014 a commitment that Ned Price, the State Department\u2019s chief spokesman, said did not \u201chave an expiration date.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo it certainly stands to reason \u2014 and we will hold the Taliban to this; the rest of the world will as well \u2014 that individuals who seek to leave after the U.S. military is gone will have an opportunity to do so,\u201d Mr. Price said on Monday.",
      "But on Tuesday, the Taliban said they would block Afghans trying to leave the country from traveling to Kabul\u2019s airport.",
      "\u201cI am pleading for the United States to help my family \u2014 the family that has been teaching English, working on military posts and are now in imminent danger for having helped America,\u201d said Fatima Jaghoori, a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Afghanistan and served in Iraq with the U.S. Army. Her husband, who also served in the American military, was killed in Afghanistan.",
      "\u201cPlease let my service and sacrifice act as a token to bring my family to safety,\u201d she wrote in a letter to U.S. officials. \u201cMy family does not have a chance at life if they are left to the Taliban rule.\u201d"

    "content": [
      "NEW ORLEANS \u2014 Helpless to improve her infant son\u2019s breathing as he was about to be intubated, Catherine Perrilloux did the only thing that came naturally to her in that moment, the worst of her life: She looked away and prayed. The boy, known as Junior, was two months old and gravely ill with Covid-19.",
      "\u201cI see a bunch of them crowding around the room with the ventilator machine, and then they pull out the tubing, and I\u2019m just losing control,\u201d Ms. Perrilloux, a dean at a nearby private school, recalled last week in her son\u2019s room in the pediatric intensive care unit. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that you could say to make it better. You can\u2019t do anything. It\u2019s just paralyzing.\u201d",
      "At Children\u2019s Hospital New Orleans, where the intensive care unit has been jammed with Covid-19 patients, scenes like this have played out unrelentingly over the past month. Nurses raced around monitoring one gut-wrenching case after another. One child was getting a complicated breathing treatment known as ECMO, a last resort after ventilators fail, which nurses said was almost unheard-of for pediatric cases. About a half-dozen others were in various stages of distress.",
      "\u201cWe all thought, \u2018Well, thankfully it\u2019s not happening to the kids; none of us would be able to stomach that,\u2019\u201d said Mark Melancon, a longtime nurse at the hospital, recalling previous stages of the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cFast forward to now, and it\u2019s happening with the kids.\u201d",
      "Mr. Melancon said that until this summer, the hospital had treated only one or two Covid-19 patients at a time. Now, a procession of patients require constant attention, their oxygen levels often dipping precariously low without maximum intervention.",
      "As children\u2019s hospitals in many parts of the United States admit more Covid-19 patients, a result of the highly contagious Delta variant, federal and state health officials are grappling with a sharp new concern: children not yet eligible for vaccination in places with substantial viral spread, now at higher risk of being infected than at any other time in the pandemic. Nowhere is that worry greater than in Louisiana, which has among the highest new daily case rates in the country and only 40 percent of people are fully vaccinated, putting children at particular risk as they return to school.",
      "Most children with Covid-19 have only mild symptoms, and there is not enough evidence to conclude that Delta makes some of them sicker than other variants do, scientists say. Doctors and nurses at Children\u2019s Hospital agreed with that assessment.",
      "Theresa Sokol, Louisiana\u2019s top epidemiologist, said that people younger than 18 had among the highest test positivity rates in the state and were responsible for a significant share of transmission, with many cases most likely undetected.",
      "\u201cSo many days are filled with this puzzle of: We don\u2019t have enough beds for this patient who wants to come, so how are we going to shuffle our children around to accommodate one more?\u201d said Devon H. Relle, a pediatric nurse practitioner at Children\u2019s Hospital New Orleans, where she worked the front desk of the 17-bed I.C.U. The hospital was also seeing an early, worrisome wave of respiratory syncytial virus, known as R.S.V., which can cause some of the same symptoms and was contributing to the overflow conditions.",
      "The crush of Covid-19 at Children\u2019s Hospital grew so intense this month that the state called in a federal \u201csurge team\u201d of emergency responders from the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019s National Disaster Medical System. The group of about 14 included a physician, a nurse practitioner, nurses, paramedics, a respiratory therapist and a pharmacist.",
      "The team was the first assigned to a children\u2019s hospital during the pandemic.",
      "\u201cCovid-19 right now down here is so endemic that you don\u2019t have to have a specific exposure, because it\u2019s just out there,\u201d said Anne Barylick, a nurse practitioner on the surge team who handled patient intake in the emergency department and Covid-19 units. \u201cStatistically, you\u2019re going to run into it.\u201d",
      "Dr. Mark W. Kline, the hospital\u2019s physician in chief, said that its overcrowded units threatened care for children across the region. It is one of the few advanced children\u2019s hospitals in Louisiana and bordering states, he said, and there are few other options for specialized pediatric care.",
      "Ms. Barylick, who works at a community health center in Rhode Island, was also deployed to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. But this deployment was fundamentally different, she said. Instead of helping with a field hospital or pop-up clinic under a tent after a natural disaster, she and her colleagues were woven into the hospital\u2019s normal operations. They rotated with members of the regular nursing staff to triage young patients and greeted them in the emergency room to assess whether they might have Covid-19.",
      "The need here was clear.",
      "\u201cI have never seen our faculty look so tired or sad,\u201d said Dr. Adele K. Evans, who leads the hospital\u2019s tracheostomy team. About 60 members of the medical staff were in quarantine last week. She called it the most difficult moment in the hospital\u2019s history.",
      "It was hard to predict which of the hospital\u2019s Covid-19 patients would recover, Ms. Barylick said. To her relief, she had seen mainly good outcomes.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want any kids to get this, because I can\u2019t guarantee that it\u2019s not going to be your kid that's going to have a problem,\u201d she said. \u201cBut overall, statistically, most of them are doing fairly well.\u201d",
      "But the sickest Covid-19 patients in the hospital were as severely ill as adults, nurses said, struggling to get enough oxygen. While some children were suffering more because of underlying health problems, other severe cases at the hospital had little explanation.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t show them, really, to be honest, that this is kind of uncharted territory,\u201d Mr. Melancon said of the anguished conversations he has with parents of children sick with Covid-19. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to project some confidence.\u201d",
      "Members of the surge team and the hospital staff said in interviews last week that Covid-19 had changed how providers cared for young patients, forcing them to \u201ccluster\u201d care by entering rooms less frequently but with more staff. That, along with limits on visitors, meant children were sometimes alone, said Angela Seput, the director of an acute care unit. And with highly infectious patients nearby, parents could no longer approach the nursing station as easily and ask for help, she said.",
      "Medical staff throughout the hospital said the causes of illness in children were often simple: parents, family members and friends who were unvaccinated and not wearing masks.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had to kind of make peace with that people are not doing what they\u2019re supposed to. The kids are suffering,\u201d Mr. Melancon said. \u201cNot that I accept it, but if I get hung up in the anger of it, I would walk around confronting people in Walmart, here, everywhere.\u201d",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t tell them, \u2018Why didn\u2019t you isolate this kid?\u2019\u201d Mr. Melancon continued. \u201cSo we just tell them, \u2018Your kid has Covid. It\u2019s really hard on the lungs. Your child\u2019s very sick. We\u2019ll do everything we can to get him better.\u2019\u201d",
      "Of the roughly 70 children admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 this month, about half were 12 or older \u2014 and thus eligible for vaccination \u2014 but only one was fully vaccinated, said Dr. Kline, the physician in chief.",
      "The virus had wreaked havoc particularly on patients with special needs and pre-existing conditions, including Calvin Bethley\u2019s son, who has asthma and scoliosis. He was just beginning to eat again after a long bout with Covid-19 and related pneumonia.",
      "Two doors away, Quintetta Edwards watched over her 17-year-old son, who has Down syndrome and was healing from his own lengthy battle with the virus. During his stay, staff members sometimes had to restrain him as he writhed against the tubes connected to him. Ms. Edwards said she felt a sense of profound guilt when her son told the nursing staff that his illness was his own fault.",
      "In the I.C.U. last week, Raquel Diaz, who has worked as a janitor there for over a decade, said the surge of Covid-19 patients had left her demoralized and worried about her own safety, even after being vaccinated and battling the illness last year.",
      "Seeing children in the rooms that she cleans suffer, she said, was \u201coverwhelming.\u201d",
      "Behind her, beeping screens monitoring the low blood oxygen levels and alarmingly high heart rates of the children told the story.",
      "Nearby, medical teams were watching over an intubated toddler. The patient eventually needed a rare treatment known as high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, which involves gentle vibrations that move air around in the lungs. By Thursday, with the odds of survival fading, a small crown was placed on the child\u2019s head.",
      "Down the hall, there was better news: Junior\u2019s condition was improving.",
      "His path to intubation had been swift. His sister, 15 months old, came down with what seemed to be a mild cold. Before long, Junior\u2019s day care reported that he was gagging when drinking from a bottle. The family\u2019s pediatrician diagnosed him with R.S.V. and prescribed albuterol, an asthma medication that had little effect on him.",
      "A day later, Ms. Perrilloux, who along with her husband is fully vaccinated, drove him to the hospital. \u201cAs soon as I brought him in, they noticed right off the bat, something was off,\u201d she said. He tested positive for Covid-19 and struggled to breathe even on a high-flow oxygen machine. He was intubated the next day.",
      "Ms. Perrilloux began working during the long days in the room, to keep herself from shaking.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re sitting there, thinking, \u2018What could I have done differently?\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Last week, Ms. Perrilloux slept and ate in her son\u2019s room. She held daily prayer sessions with her pastor and family. At bedtime, she smoothed Junior\u2019s curly brown hair gently to avoid interfering with the machinery that was keeping him alive. She positioned her chair to observe the monitors tracking his vital signs, wrapping herself in hospital blankets.",
      "\u201cWith the six sisters that he has at home, he has no choice but to be strong,\u201d she said.",
      "Ms. Perrilloux received the news shortly after 8 a.m. on Friday: The hospital was ready to try extubating Junior and putting him on oxygen. Around 10:30 a.m., Ms. Perrilloux clasped her hands and prayed. As the I.C.U. team delicately removed Junior\u2019s breathing tube, there were quiet cheers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s OK. It\u2019s OK,\u201d Ms. Perrilloux told her baby softly.",
      "Junior left the I.C.U. on Tuesday but remained in the hospital on high-flow oxygen, still with occasional moments of irregular breathing. Ms. Perrilloux has taken to playing Etta James for him in his new room.",
      "\u201cIt soothes him,\u201d she said, \u201cand he goes to sleep.\u201d"

    "title": "Powell Signals Federal Reserve Could Slow Bond Purchases This Year",
    "content": [
      "Eighteen months into the pandemic, Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, has offered the strongest sign yet that the Fed is prepared to soon withdraw one leg of the support it has been providing to the economy as conditions strengthen.",
      "At the same time, Mr. Powell made clear on Friday that interest rate increases remained far away, and that the central bank was monitoring risks posed by the Delta variant of the coronavirus.",
      "The Fed has been trying to bolster economic activity by buying $120 billion in government-backed bonds each month and by leaving its policy interest rate at rock bottom. Officials have been debating when to begin slowing their bond buying, the first step in moving toward a more normal policy setting. They have said they would like to make \u201csubstantial further progress\u201d toward stable inflation and full employment before doing so.",
      "Mr. Powell, speaking at a closely watched conference that the Kansas City Fed holds each year, used his remarks to explain that he thinks the Fed has met that test when it comes to inflation and is making \u201cclear progress toward maximum employment.\u201d",
      "As of the Fed\u2019s last meeting, in July, \u201cI was of the view, as were most participants, that if the economy evolved broadly as anticipated, it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year,\u201d he said.",
      "But the Fed is navigating a difficult set of economic conditions. Growth has picked up and inflation is rising as consumers, flush with stimulus money, look to spend and companies struggle to meet that demand amid pandemic-related supply disruptions. Yet there are nearly six million fewer jobs than before the pandemic. And the Delta variant could cause consumers and businesses to pull back as it foils return-to-office plans and threatens to shut down schools and child care centers. That could lead to a slower jobs rebound.",
      "Mr. Powell made clear that the Fed wants to avoid overreacting to a recent burst in inflation that it believes will most likely prove temporary, because doing so could leave workers on the sidelines and weaken growth prematurely. While the Fed could start to remove one piece of its support, he emphasized that slowing bond purchases did not indicate that the Fed was prepared to raise rates.",
      "\u201cWe have much ground to cover to reach maximum employment, and time will tell whether we have reached 2 percent inflation on a sustainable basis,\u201d he said in his address to the conference, which was held online instead of its usual venue \u2014 Jackson Hole in Wyoming \u2014 because of the latest coronavirus wave.",
      "The distinction he drew \u2014 between bond buying, which keeps financial markets chugging along, and rates, which are the Fed\u2019s more traditional and arguably more powerful tool to keep money cheap and demand strong \u2014 sent an important signal that the Fed is going to be careful to let the economy heal more fully before really putting away its monetary tools, economists said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s trying to reassure, in a time of extraordinary uncertainty,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at the accounting firm Grant Thornton. \u201cThe takeaway is: We\u2019re not going to snuff out a recovery. We\u2019re not going to snuff it out too early.\u201d",
      "Stocks rose on Friday, with gains picking up steam after Mr. Powell\u2019s comments were released and investors realized that a rate increase was not in sight.",
      "Richard H. Clarida, the Fed\u2019s vice chair, agreed with Mr. Powell\u2019s approach, saying in an interview with CNBC that if the labor market continued to strengthen, \u201cI would also support commencing a reduction in the pace of our purchases later this year.\u201d",
      "Some Fed policymakers have called for the central bank to slow its purchases soon, and move swiftly toward ending them completely.",
      "Raphael Bostic, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, told CNBC on Friday that he supported winding down the purchases \u201cas quickly as possible.\u201d",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s start the taper, and let\u2019s do it quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s not have this linger.\u201d",
      "James Bullard, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said on Friday that the central bank should finish tapering by the end of the first quarter next year. If inflation starts to moderate then, the country will be in \u201cgreat shape,\u201d Mr. Bullard told Fox Business.",
      "\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t moderate, then I think the Fed is going to have to be more aggressive in 2022,\u201d he said.",
      "Central bankers are trying avoid the mistakes of the last expansion, when they raised interest rates as unemployment dropped to fend off inflation \u2014 only to have price gains stagnate at uncomfortably low levels, suggesting that they had pulled back support too early. Mr. Powell ushered in a new policy framework at last year\u2019s Jackson Hole gathering that dictates a more patient approach, one that might guard against a similar overreaction.",
      "But as Mr. Bullard\u2019s comments reflected, officials may have their patience tested as inflation climbs.",
      "The Fed\u2019s preferred price gauge, the personal consumption expenditures index, rose 4.2 percent last month from a year earlier, according to Commerce Department data released on Friday. The increase was higher than the 4.1 percent jump that economists in a Bloomberg survey had projected, and the fastest pace since 1991. That is far above the central bank\u2019s 2 percent target, which it tries to hit on average over time.",
      "\u201cThe rapid reopening of the economy has brought a sharp run-up in inflation,\u201d Mr. Powell said.",
      "Policymakers at the Fed are debating how to interpret the current price burst. Because it has come from categories of goods and services that have been affected by the pandemic and supply-chain disruptions, including used cars and airplane tickets, most expect inflation to abate. But some worry that the process will take long enough that consumers\u2019 inflation expectations will move up, prompting workers to demand higher wages and leading to faster price gains in the longer run.",
      "Other officials worry that today\u2019s hot prices are more likely to give way to slower gains once pandemic-related disruptions are resolved \u2014 and that long-run trends that have dragged inflation lower for decades, including population aging, will once again bite. They warn that if the Fed overreacts to today\u2019s inflationary burst, it could wind up with permanently weak inflation, much as Japan and Europe have.",
      "White House economists sided with Mr. Powell\u2019s interpretation in a new round of forecasts issued on Friday. In its midsession review of the administration\u2019s budget forecasts, the Office of Management and Budget said it expected the Consumer Price Index inflation rate to hit 4.8 percent for the year. That is more than double the administration\u2019s initial forecast of 2.1 percent.",
      "The forecast was an admission of sorts that prices have jumped higher and that the increase has lingered longer than administration officials initially expected. But they still insist that it will be short-lived and foresee inflation dropping to 2.5 percent in 2022. The White House also revised its forecast of growth for the year, to 7.1 percent from 5.2 percent.",
      "Slow price gains sound like good news to anyone who buys oat milk and eggs, but they can set off a vicious downward cycle. Interest rates include inflation, so when it slows, Fed officials have less room to make money cheap to foster growth during times of trouble. That makes it harder for the economy to recover quickly from downturns, and long periods of weak demand drag prices even lower \u2014 creating a cycle of stagnation.",
      "\u201cWhile the underlying global disinflationary factors are likely to evolve over time, there is little reason to think that they have suddenly reversed or abated,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cIt seems more likely that they will continue to weigh on inflation as the pandemic passes into history.\u201d",
      "Mr. Powell offered a detailed explanation of the Fed\u2019s scrutiny of prices, emphasizing that inflation is \u201cso far\u201d coming from a narrow group of goods and services. Officials are keeping an eye on data to make sure prices for durable goods like used cars \u2014 which have recently taken off \u2014 slow and even fall.",
      "Mr. Powell said the Fed saw \u201clittle evidence\u201d of wage increases that might threaten high and lasting inflation. And he pointed out that measures of inflation expectations had not climbed to unwanted levels, but had instead staged a \u201cwelcome reversal\u201d of an unhealthy decline.",
      "Still, his remarks carried a tone of watchfulness.",
      "\u201cWe would be concerned at signs that inflationary pressures were spreading more broadly through the economy,\u201d he said."

      "CHICAGO \u2014 Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois announced on Thursday a new, stricter set of coronavirus restrictions, ordering a statewide indoor mask mandate and requiring that all educators be vaccinated or face regular testing.",
      "The mask mandate applies to all Illinois residents age 2 and older and begins on Monday. The vaccine rule, effective Sept. 5, affects all teachers and staff in schools from kindergarten through college.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, we are running out of time as our hospitals run out of beds,\u201d Mr. Pritzker said at a news conference on Thursday. \u201cHospital staff are becoming overwhelmed and overburdened. People are dying who don\u2019t have to die.\u201d",
      "Mr. Pritzker, a Democrat, has taken an aggressive approach to restrictions intended to slow the spread of the coronavirus, which has spiked in Illinois in recent weeks, particularly in the downstate region, where intensive-care beds are scarce. Illinois reported a seven-day average of 3,547 cases on Wednesday, more than three times the average cases reported one month ago.",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Pritzker issued a mask mandate for students, faculty and staff in preschools, elementary and high schools throughout the state. He has also mandated masks in state-run nursing homes and similar facilities, and required vaccinations of people who work there. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended masking for everyone in schools, regardless of vaccination status, and several states, including California and Connecticut, have school mask mandates in place.",
      "Under the new vaccine rule in Illinois, educators who decline to be vaccinated will be required to submit to testing at least once a week.",
      "The move comes as other states and cities weigh vaccine mandates after the Food and Drug Administration this week granted full approval to Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s coronavirus vaccine for people 16 and older, making it the first to move beyond emergency-use status in the United States.",
      "Earlier this week, Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey said that all teachers in that state would have to either be vaccinated or submit to weekly testing. California and Hawaii have similar mandates in place. And the cities of Los Angeles and Chicago, as well as Washington State and Oregon, have also recently announced full vaccine mandates for teachers.",
      "On Wednesday, Mayor Lori Lightfoot of Chicago said she would require all city employees, including police officers, sanitation workers and park employees, to be fully vaccinated by Oct. 15. Chicago and Cook County already have indoor mask mandates in place."

    "title": "The Guerrilla Street Artist Stumping for Larry Elder",
    "content": [
      "Every now and again over the past couple of decades, the right-wing street artist Sabo has popped up, aggravating Los Angeles liberals.",
      "Westside residents may recall the billboard for the movie \u201cParasite\u201d that he altered to depict 2020 Democratic presidential contenders under the movie title. Or Meryl Streep denying his accusation that \u201cshe knew\u201d about Hollywood sexual harassment, plastered on posters around town during the Harvey Weinstein scandal.",
      "Over the years, Sabo\u2019s Facebook page has been taken down, his Twitter account has been blocked and his Instagram feed has been disabled. Even Senator Ted Cruz, the hard-line Texas conservative whom Sabo supported during the 2016 presidential primaries, distanced himself after The Texas Tribune put a spotlight on the artist\u2019s inflammatory social media posts.",
      "A dropout from the ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena, Sabo has made a name as a sort of Shepard Fairey of the right since the mid-2000s. His headquarters until the pandemic were an apartment in the West Los Angeles neighborhood of Palms.",
      "Lately, Sabo said, he and his wife have been living with relatives in Colorado, where he continues to operate an online gallery, Unsavoryagents. But he still deploys his political art in California to further conservative causes. His most recent: the campaign to recall Gov. Gavin Newsom and replace him with the talk radio host Larry Elder, the front-running Republican challenger.",
      "I caught up with Sabo, 53, by phone to discuss his advocacy around the coming election. Californians have until Sept. 14 to return the recall ballots that have been sent out to the 22 million active registered voters across the state. Here\u2019s some of our conversation, edited for length and clarity.",
      "Why have you left California?",
      "If I wasn\u2019t married, I\u2019d still be in L.A. But it got to the point where I couldn\u2019t leave my apartment without worrying if someone was going to crawl in through the window. It\u2019s kind of on hold, but I seriously doubt I\u2019ll move back. The only redeeming quality it had was it was cheap.",
      "How did you end up campaigning for Larry Elder?",
      "I\u2019ve listened to Larry Elder for decades. There was a time in the mid-1990s when I listened to talk radio from the moment I woke up to the minute I went to sleep. Most people would come to a point where they were entertaining but not intellectually honest. I didn\u2019t agree with everything Larry said, but I appreciated his consistency.",
      "Anyway, one day two or three years ago I was at an event and someone said, \u201cLarry Elder\u2019s over there, let\u2019s go say hi.\u201d And he was like, \u201cWow, you\u2019re Sabo \u2014 you\u2019re a fixture in L.A.\u201d Then I saw him again, in a similar situation. Just hello and a picture. And I generally don\u2019t like politicians, but I might have said let\u2019s grab lunch.",
      "So you had a business lunch?",
      "I just wanted to see what made him tick. It was a couple months before the election in 2020. I was operating on a couple hours of sleep, but he was firing off questions, personal questions about my father, my upbringing, what I do and why I do it. I grew up in Louisiana and Texas. He told me a touching story about his father and I told him a story about my father, who is Mexican, that was very rough.",
      "So how did you end up doing his campaign posters?",
      "I give him art to put on his Instagram sometimes. About a week before he announced, he emailed, like, \u201cHey, man, I\u2019m thinking about running for governor.\u201d I said, \u201cYou\u2019re a good man, you\u2019ve got to run.\u201d So right after he announced, I did a poster, but just for myself, not for his campaign. And then some people were doing a fund-raiser and they asked me to donate something.",
      "Where can people find your work?",
      "I\u2019ve done like three posters of Larry \u2014 a green one with poppies that I put up in Brentwood and the Pacific Palisades, one of Larry and Gavin Newsom boxing that I put up around Hollywood and Inglewood, maybe one more. But I\u2019m the fastest censored artist in America when I put up posters in L.A. By the time we went to take pictures in the morning, some of those posters were already down.",

    "title": "ISIS Branch Poses Biggest Immediate Terrorist Threat to Evacuation in Kabul",
    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The United States has been battling the Taliban and their militant partners in Afghanistan, Al Qaeda and the Haqqani network, for 20 years.",
      "But the biggest immediate threat to both the Americans and the Taliban as the United States escalates its evacuation at the Kabul airport before an Aug. 31 withdrawal deadline is a common rival that is lesser known: Islamic State Khorasan, or ISIS-K, the terrorist group\u2019s affiliate in Afghanistan.",
      "Created six years ago by disaffected Pakistani Taliban, ISIS-K has carried out dozens of attacks in Afghanistan this year. American military and intelligence analysts say threats from the group include a bomb-laden truck, suicide bombers infiltrating the crowd outside Hamid Karzai International Airport and mortar strikes against the airfield.",
      "These threats, coupled with new demands by the Taliban for the United States to leave by Aug. 31, probably influenced President Biden\u2019s decision on Tuesday to stick to that deadline. \u201cEvery day we\u2019re on the ground is another day we know that ISIS-K is seeking to target the airport and attack both U.S. and allied forces and innocent civilians,\u201d Mr. Biden said.",
      "The U.S. Embassy on Wednesday warned Americans to stay away from the airport and told anyone outside the perimeter to \u201cleave immediately.\u201d",
      "A senior U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe confidential assessments, confirmed that the United States was tracking a \u201cspecific\u201d and \u201ccredible\u201d threat at the airport from ISIS-K, which has carried out dozens of attacks in recent years.",
      "The threats lay bare a complicated dynamic between the Taliban, Al Qaeda and the Haqqani network, and their bitter rival, ISIS-K, in what analysts say portends a bloody struggle involving thousands of foreign fighters on both sides.",
      "A United Nations report in June concluded that 8,000 to 10,000 fighters from Central Asia, the North Caucasus region of Russia, Pakistan and the Xinjiang region in western China have poured into Afghanistan in recent months. Most are associated with the Taliban or Al Qaeda, the report said, but others are allied with ISIS-K.",
      "\u201cAfghanistan has now become the Las Vegas of the terrorists, of the radicals and of the extremists,\u201d said Ali Mohammad Ali, a former Afghan security official. \u201cPeople all over the world, radicals and extremists, are chanting, celebrating the Taliban victory. This is paving the way for other extremists to come to Afghanistan.\u201d",
      "American officials say they are preparing to combat both immediate and longer-term terrorist challenges in Afghanistan. First and foremost is the threat at the Kabul airport.",
      "Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden\u2019s national security adviser, said on Sunday that the threat from ISIS-K was \u201cacute\u201d and \u201cpersistent,\u201d and that American commanders and other officials were taking all possible steps to thwart any attacks.",
      "That includes striking an unlikely accommodation with the Taliban, at least temporarily, not only to allow safe passage to American citizens and Afghan allies to the airport for flights out of the country, but also to actively defend against an ISIS-K attack.",
      "The leaders of the Islamic State in Afghanistan denounced the Taliban takeover of the country, criticizing their version of Islamic rule as insufficiently hard line, and the two groups have fought in recent years.",
      "An attack on the airport, current and former American officials said, would be a strategic blow to both the United States and the Taliban leadership, which is trying to demonstrate that it can control the country. Such a strike would bolster ISIS-K\u2019s stature in the jihadist world, but that opportunity greatly diminishes after the last American Marine or soldier pulls out.",
      "The Taliban and the Haqqani network, a militant group based in Pakistan, are essentially one and the same, terrorism experts say. Siraj Haqqani has been the deputy emir of the Taliban since 2015. In turn, the Haqqanis are close, operationally and ideologically, to Al Qaeda.",
      "\u201cThe Taliban, Haqqani network, and Al Qaeda function as a triumvirate, and one that is very much part of the same militant network, they work together hand-in-glove,\u201d said Colin P. Clarke, a counterterrorism analyst at the Soufan Group, a security consulting firm based in New York.",
      "These three entities are inextricably linked, Mr. Clarke said, and in fact, have grown closer over the past decade, a trend that is likely to continue after the U.S. withdrawal, especially as they close ranks against adversaries like ISIS-K and the growing resistance movement in Afghanistan\u2019s north.",
      "On the other side of the jihadist ledger is ISIS-K. The group is one of many affiliates that the Islamic State established after it swept into northern Iraq from Syria in 2014, and created a religious state or caliphate the size of Britain. An American-led campaign crushed the caliphate, but more than 10,000 ISIS fighters remain in Iraq and Syria, and ISIS affiliates like the Sahel or the Sinai Peninsula are thriving.",
      "But ISIS-K has never been a major force in Afghanistan, much less globally, analysts say. The group\u2019s ranks have dropped to about 1,500 to 2,000 fighters, about half from its peak levels in 2016 before American airstrikes and Afghan commando raids took a toll.",
      "Since June 2020, however, under an ambitious new leader, Shahab al-Muhajir, the affiliate \u201cremains active and dangerous,\u201d and is seeking to swell its ranks with disaffected Taliban fighters and other militants, the U.N. report concluded.",
      "\u201cThey have not been a first-tier ISIS affiliate, but with the Afghan commandos gone and the American military gone, does that give them breathing room? It could,\u201d said Seth G. Jones, an Afghanistan specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.",
      "Even as the group\u2019s overall ranks have declined in recent years, Mr. Jones said, ISIS-K has maintained cells of clandestine fighters who have carried out terrorist attacks.",
      "United Nations counterterrorism officials said in the June report that the Islamic State had conducted 77 attacks in Afghanistan in the first four months of this year, up from 21 in the same period in 2020. The attacks last year included a strike against Kabul University in November and a rocket barrage against the airport in Kabul a month later. ISIS-K is believed to have been responsible for a school bombing in the capital that killed 80 schoolgirls in May.",
      "\u201cKabul has been the target of the majority of ISIS-K\u2019s most sophisticated and complex attacks in the past,\u201d said Abdul Sayed, a specialist on jihadist groups in Afghanistan and Pakistan who is based in Lund, Sweden.",
      "Some analysts believe ISIS-K may have links to the Haqqani network. Indeed, Shahab al-Muhajir, the ISIS leader, is reported to have been a former midlevel Haqqani commander before defecting.",
      "\u201cSince many ISIS commanders and fighters were once part of Al Qaeda or an Al Qaeda franchise, it is not surprising that there should be this contact,\u201d said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIn most cases, this contact has not produced any lasting reconciliation.\u201d",
      "The rivalry between the Taliban and its partners and ISIS-K will continue after the last American troops leave, analysts say. And the fragile cooperation between American and Taliban commanders is already fraying, and the two could easily revert to their adversarial stances.",
      "The American military is treating the Taliban\u2019s red line about Aug. 31 seriously. The recent evacuations have been possible because of Taliban cooperation \u2014 in allowing most people to reach the airport unscathed, and in working against the threat of ISIS attacks, commanders say.",
      "After Aug. 31, military officials say, there is a real concern that at best, the cooperation with the Taliban will end. At worst, that could lead to attacks on U.S. forces, foreign citizens and Afghan allies, either by Taliban elements or by their turning a blind eye to Islamic State threats.",
      "Mr. Biden has pledged to prevent Afghanistan from again becoming a sanctuary for Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups that want to attack the American homeland. Military commanders say that will be a difficult task, with no troops and few spies on the ground, and armed Reaper drones thousands of miles away at bases in the Persian Gulf.",
      "In the February 2020 agreement with the Trump administration, the Taliban vowed not to allow Al Qaeda to use Afghan territory to attack the United States. But analysts fear that is not happening and that Al Qaeda remains the longer-term terrorism threat.",
      "As the U.N. report put it: \u201cThe Taliban and Al Qaeda remain closely aligned and show no indication of breaking ties.\u201d"

    "title": "",
    "content": [
      "The United Nations recently released a major scientific report concluding that a hotter future is certain but that there is still a chance to prevent the most dire outcomes. Brad Plumer, a climate reporter for The New York Times, says there is a consensus among scientists on what must happen to limit global warming: Nations need to stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. In an interview, Mr. Plumer, who focuses on the policy and technology efforts to cut carbon dioxide emissions, discussed the significance of the U.N. report, how he approaches a subject that can be upsetting to readers and his own environmentally conscious efforts. This interview has been edited.",
      "What questions are you interested in exploring on your beat?",
      "Halting further emissions of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly from fossil fuels and deforestation, is an enormous task, and it means rethinking so many fundamental aspects of the modern global economy, from the cars we drive to how we produce food. So I\u2019m drawn to writing about people trying to figure out the best ways to get to zero emissions, as well as the huge structural challenges standing in the way.",
      "Did you know this U.N. report was coming?",
      "We\u2019ve known this report was coming for some time. Every few years since 1990, the U.N.\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has put out comprehensive assessments of the latest science around global warming, which means essentially summarizing thousands of existing studies into a coherent picture. This was the sixth such assessment, and hundreds of scientists had been working to put it together for months.",
      "For this particular report, we were able to get our hands on a few early drafts that allowed us to figure out what was new and noteworthy here. And my colleague Henry Fountain and I called up a number of scientists beforehand to get a better sense of how climate research has advanced since the I.P.C.C.\u2019s last big assessment in 2013. That early prep work helped us write an initial version of the story ahead of time. Then, when the panel released a finalized embargoed draft to reporters three days before its release, we could quickly check our facts to make sure we hadn\u2019t missed anything big and then called up more authors for official comment.",
      "What is the significance of a report like this?",
      "In a lot of ways, the overall picture on climate change hasn\u2019t shifted much since the first I.P.C.C. report in 1990. Scientists have been warning us for decades that emissions from fossil fuels and deforestation can and will warm the planet, with damaging consequences.",
      "But a few big things are different now. First, global warming is much more pronounced today than it was back then. Countries around the world have continued to increase their emissions, and the planet is now about 1.1 degrees Celsius hotter than it was in the 19th century. That means many of the impacts scientists have long warned about \u2014 more frequent heat waves, more severe droughts, ice sheets melting in Greenland and Antarctica that push up sea levels along the coasts \u2014 can now be seen very clearly in the present tense. This latest report offered the clearest look yet at how climate change is already, today, fueling a rise in extreme weather across the globe.",
      "And scientists are now able to model with much more precision what\u2019s likely to happen in the future. So there\u2019s more confidence now that humans have basically locked in another half a degree or so of total global warming over the next 30 years.That adds an important twist to the challenge facing humanity: Yes, we\u2019ll have to slash emissions if we want to prevent future global warming from getting even worse. But there are also dangers that are now unavoidable and we\u2019ll need to take steps to adapt, such as managing forests to reduce wildfire risk or protecting people in cities from heat waves.",
      "What questions did the U.N. report raise for you?",
      "One of the starkest points in the report is that nations of the world essentially need to zero out all of their fossil-fuel emissions over the next few decades if we want to avoid an even bigger rise in global warming than what\u2019s already locked in. Plus we probably need to figure out how to suck vast quantities of carbon dioxide back out of the atmosphere.",
      "Doing all that would require an overhaul of the global energy system at a speed without precedent in human history. It\u2019s staggering. So how do we do that? What technologies do we need? What sort of problems or dislocations might a huge transformation like that create? What mistakes might we make along the way? There are lots of smart people who think that this transformation is doable, but it certainly won\u2019t be easy.",
      "Climate coverage is a huge focus at The Times, but the topic can be unsettling for readers. Is this something you think about as you report and write these articles?",
      "We do think about this a lot. When scientists are warning that global warming will impose real dangers and hardships around the world, I don\u2019t think we can shy away from reporting that as plainly as we can, even if it can be scary or disheartening. It\u2019s impossible to deal with a challenge like climate change unless we can clearly see what we\u2019re up against.",
      "But there\u2019s also so much more to the climate story than merely doom and gloom. At the Climate desk and elsewhere at The Times, we write about people and cities coming up with creative ideas for protecting themselves against extreme weather. We write about how climate change intersects with existing social inequalities, and what might be done in response. We write about inventors and businesses tinkering with novel strategies for cutting emissions. We write about how climate change is transforming politics. We write about how individuals wrestle with their gut-level feelings on climate change.",
      "Climate change \u2014 along with efforts to cut emissions and limit the damage \u2014 is going to be a central fact about the world for decades to come, touching on so many different aspects of modern life. Some of those stories will be grim, some will be hopeful. The trick is to try to capture that world, as best we can, in all its messy complexity.",
      "Has reading this report, or previous reports, changed your own behavior at all?",
      "I generally think that individual efforts to cut emissions are great, but most people\u2019s choices are constrained by the environment around them. So, for instance, I mostly walk or bike or take the bus to get around every day, but it\u2019s easy for me to do so because I live in a walkable neighborhood in Washington with easy transit options. Most people in the United States don\u2019t have that choice, because most cities simply aren\u2019t built like that. Finding ways to transform our built environment so that more people have alternatives to driving would go so much further than trying to guilt people into driving less when they don\u2019t have much choice."

    "title": "Facebook Said to Consider Forming an Election Commission",
    "content": [
      "Facebook has approached academics and policy experts about forming a commission to advise it on global election-related matters, said five people with knowledge of the discussions, a move that would allow the social network to shift some of its political decision-making to an advisory body.",
      "The proposed commission could decide on matters such as the viability of political ads and what to do about election-related misinformation, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were confidential. Facebook is expected to announce the commission this fall in preparation for the 2022 midterm elections, they said, though the effort is preliminary and could still fall apart.",
      "Outsourcing election matters to a panel of experts could help Facebook sidestep criticism of bias by political groups, two of the people said. The company has been blasted in recent years by conservatives, who have accused Facebook of suppressing their voices, as well as by civil rights groups and Democrats for allowing political misinformation to fester and spread online. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, does not want to be seen as the sole decision maker on political content, two of the people said.",
      "Facebook declined to comment.",
      "If an election commission is formed, it would emulate the step Facebook took in 2018 when it created what it calls the Oversight Board, a collection of journalism, legal and policy experts who adjudicate whether the company was correct to remove certain posts from its platforms. Facebook has pushed some content decisions to the Oversight Board for review, allowing it to show that it does not make determinations on its own.",
      "Facebook, which has positioned the Oversight Board as independent, appointed the people on the panel and pays them through a trust.",
      "The Oversight Board\u2019s highest-profile decision was reviewing Facebook\u2019s suspension of former President Donald J. Trump after the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol. At the time, Facebook opted to ban Mr. Trump\u2019s account indefinitely, a penalty that the Oversight Board later deemed \u201cnot appropriate\u201d because the time frame was not based on any of the company\u2019s rules. The board asked Facebook to try again.",
      "In June, Facebook responded by saying that it would bar Mr. Trump from the platform for at least two years. The Oversight Board has separately weighed in on more than a dozen other content cases that it calls \u201chighly emblematic\u201d of broader themes that Facebook grapples with regularly, including whether certain Covid-related posts should remain up on the network and hate speech issues in Myanmar.",
      "A spokesman for the Oversight Board declined to comment.",
      "Facebook has had a spotty track record on election-related issues, going back to Russian manipulation of the platform\u2019s advertising and posts in the 2016 presidential election.",
      "Lawmakers and political ad buyers also criticized Facebook for changing the rules around political ads before the 2020 presidential election. Last year, the company said it would bar the purchase of new political ads the week before the election, then later decided to temporarily ban all U.S. political advertising after the polls closed on Election Day, causing an uproar among candidates and ad-buying firms.",
      "The company has struggled with how to handle lies and hate speech around elections. During his last year in office, Mr. Trump used Facebook to suggest he would use state violence against protesters in Minneapolis ahead of the 2020 election, while casting doubt on the electoral process as votes were tallied in November. Facebook initially said that what political leaders posted was newsworthy and should not be touched, before later reversing course.",
      "The social network has also faced difficulties in elections elsewhere, including the proliferation of targeted disinformation across its WhatsApp messaging service during the Brazilian presidential election in 2018. In 2019, Facebook removed hundreds of misleading pages and accounts associated with political parties in India ahead of the country\u2019s national elections.",
      "Facebook has tried various methods to stem the criticisms. It established a political ads library to increase transparency around buyers of those promotions. It also has set up war rooms to monitor elections for disinformation to prevent interference.",
      "There are several elections in the coming year in countries such as Hungary, Germany, Brazil and the Philippines where Facebook\u2019s actions will be closely scrutinized. Voter fraud misinformation has already begun spreading ahead of German elections in September. In the Philippines, Facebook has removed networks of fake accounts that support President Rodrigo Duterte, who used the social network to gain power in 2016.",
      "\u201cThere is already this perception that Facebook, an American social media company, is going in and tilting elections of other countries through its platform,\u201d said Nathaniel Persily, a law professor at Stanford University. \u201cWhatever decisions Facebook makes have global implications.\u201d",
      "Internal conversations around an election commission date back to at least a few months ago, said three people with knowledge of the matter.",
      "An election commission would differ from the Oversight Board in one key way, the people said. While the Oversight Board waits for Facebook to remove a post or an account and then reviews that action, the election commission would proactively provide guidance without the company having made an earlier call, they said.",
      "Tatenda Musapatike, who previously worked on elections at Facebook and now runs a nonprofit voter registration organization, said that many have lost faith in the company\u2019s abilities to work with political campaigns. But the election commission proposal was \u201ca good step,\u201d she said, because \u201cthey're doing something and they\u2019re not saying we alone can handle it.\u201d"

    "title": "How a Defunct Federal Provision Helped Pave the Way for New Voting Restrictions",
    "content": [
      "Georgia toughened identification requirements for absentee voting. Arizona authorized removing voters from the rolls if they do not cast a ballot at least once every two years. Florida and Georgia cut back sharply the use of drop boxes for mail-in ballots.",
      "All of these new voting restrictions would have been rejected or at least softened if a federal civil rights protection from the 1960s were still intact, experts in election law said.",
      "For decades, the heart of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a practice known as preclearance, largely detailed under Section 5 of the statute. It forced states with a history of racial discrimination to seek approval from the Department of Justice before enacting new voting laws. Through preclearance, thousands of proposed voting changes were blocked by Justice Department lawyers in both Democratic and Republican administrations.",
      "In 2013, however, Section 5 was hollowed out by the Supreme Court, as Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote in a majority opinion that racial discrimination in voting no longer constituted a significant threat.",
      "As Republican-led state legislatures have tightened voting rules after the 2020 election, new restrictions have been enacted or proposed in four states that are no longer required to seek approval before changing voting laws: Georgia, Arizona, Texas and Florida. Those new restrictions would almost certainly have been halted, stalled or altered had Section 5 still been in use, according to interviews with former federal prosecutors and a review by The New York Times of past civil rights actions by the Justice Department.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing subtle about what they\u2019re trying to do,\u201d said Tom Perez, the former head of the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division and a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee. \u201cIf Section 5 were still around, those laws would not see the light of day.\u201d",
      "The restoration of preclearance is now at the center of a debate in Congress over the passage of federal voting legislation.",
      "On Tuesday, the House passed the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would restore preclearance in several states, among other changes. Attorney General Merrick B. Garland has urged Congress to revive preclearance, but Senate Republicans oppose such a move, and a filibuster in the Senate threatens to sink the bill before it can reach President Biden\u2019s desk.",
      "Section 5 covered nine states \u2014 Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia \u2014 and several counties in New York, Florida, California, South Dakota and North Carolina.",
      "Many changes sailed through the Department of Justice during the years of preclearance. Still, thousands of proposed voting laws and rules were found to be discriminatory. From January 1982 to July 2005, Justice Department lawyers filed 2,282 objections to 387,673 proposed voting changes under Section 5, according to a study by the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law.",
      "Again and again this year, states have enacted voting restrictions that closely track measures that were flagged and rejected years ago under preclearance.",
      "In Georgia, a law that toughened ID requirements for absentee voting will have a disproportionate effect on Black voters, who make up about a third of the electorate. More than 272,000 registered voters lack the forms of identification that are newly required to cast absentee ballots, according to a study by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. More than half of them are Black.",
      "\u201cIf you have a voter-ID law where a lot of people don\u2019t have one of the IDs, that\u2019s a red flag,\u201d said Jon Greenbaum, chief counsel for the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and a former voting rights lawyer for the Justice Department under the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations.",
      "Mr. Perez, the head of the civil rights division from 2009 to 2013, recalled an Arizona bill that proposed barring third parties from dropping off absentee ballots on behalf of voters. The Navajo Nation protested that some of its communities were hours from the nearest mailbox, making the act of voting by mail an arduous one.",
      "The Justice Department pushed back at Arizona lawmakers in preclearance. \u201cWe asked them a series of very pointed questions because we had real concerns that it was discriminatory, and they withdrew it,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a result of the questions we asked, Section 5 worked in that case. But once Section 5 was emasculated in 2013, they had free rein to enact it.\u201d",
      "That bill, Mr. Perez noted, was similar to a new Arizona ban on ballot collection upheld in a recent Supreme Court decision.",
      "Republicans across the country have defended the new voting laws and denied they are restrictive, often repeating the mantra that the laws make it \u201ceasier to vote, harder to cheat.\u201d",
      "Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia called a Justice Department lawsuit over the state\u2019s new ID requirements \u201cdisgusting\u201d and a \u201cpolitically motivated assault on the rule of law.\u201d",
      "Republicans do not dispute that the current Department of Justice, under Mr. Garland, would have challenged the new laws under Section 5. But they argue that the Biden administration is focusing on the politics of voting rights and not on the merits of the laws.",
      "\u201cLaws that would have likely been precleared in a previous Democratic administration would be easily objected to by the current Biden administration,\u201d said Justin Riemer, the chief counsel at the Republican National Committee.",
      "He added: \u201cAnd it is very apparent to us that their determinations would be politically motivated in stopping states from enacting reasonable regulations that protect the integrity of their election processes.\u201d",
      "Six former leaders of the civil rights division under Republican presidents from Ronald Reagan to Donald J. Trump declined to comment or did not respond to requests to comment.",
      "The greatest power of Section 5, voting rights experts said, was as a deterrent.",
      "The burden of proof that laws were not discriminatory was placed on covered states: They had to show that the laws were not going to further restrict voting rights among communities of color.",
      "\u201cA lot of these provisions would have never been enacted in the first place if Section 5 were still there,\u201d Mr. Greenbaum said. \u201cBecause these states know that if they couldn\u2019t disprove retrogression, it would go down in flames.\u201d",
      "The recent law in Arizona that removed voters from the permanent early voting list if they do not cast a ballot at least once every two years caught the eye of Deval Patrick, who led the civil rights division during the Clinton administration and later was governor of Massachusetts.",
      "In 1994, Mr. Patrick objected to a Georgia proposal that would purge registered voters from the rolls if they failed to vote for three years unless they reaffirmed their registration status. He said the Arizona law struck him as another example of purging.",
      "\u201cI think purging is one of the more pernicious undertakings, and I say this as somebody who is preternaturally neat,\u201d Mr. Patrick said. \u201cIt is easier in many states today to keep a driver\u2019s license than it is to keep your voter registration.\u201d",
      "Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona, a Republican, insisted that the new law was about election integrity. Active voters would still get ballots, while resources would be freed for \u201cpriorities like election security and voter education,\u201d he said in a video after signing the bill. \u201cNot a single Arizona voter will lose their right to vote as a result of this new law.\u201d",
      "Mr. Patrick also said the preclearance process had helped prevent changes in voting rules aimed at engineering a victory.",
      "He pointed to Georgia, where Mr. Biden won by fewer than 12,000 votes. Georgia\u2019s new voting law prohibits the use of provisional ballots by voters who show up at the wrong precinct before 5 p.m. on Election Day. But \u201cout of precinct\u201d voters accounted for 44 percent of provisional ballots last year, by far the most common reason. Of 11,120 provisional ballots counted, Mr. Biden won 64 percent.",
      "\u201cWhen the margin of victory was as slim as it was, the notion that the provisional ballots might not be counted because of some very technical and frankly trivial issue, that\u2019s a problem,\u201d Mr. Patrick said.",
      "Voting rights lawyers also liken new laws curbing the use of drop boxes to past attempts \u2014 blocked by the Justice Department under preclearance \u2014 to reduce the numbers of polling places or absentee-ballot locations.",
      "In 1984 alone, for example, Reagan administration lawyers objected to the relocation of a Dallas polling place to a predominantly white community from a largely Black one, and challenged bills in Arizona that would have reduced access to polling places by rotating locations and cutting operating hours.",
      "In Georgia, 56 percent of absentee voters in urban Fulton County and suburban Cobb, DeKalb and Gwinnett counties returned their ballots in drop boxes, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Under Georgia\u2019s new law, those counties will now have just 23 drop boxes, compared with 94 during the 2020 election.",
      "And in Texas last year, with roughly a month left before Election Day, Gov. Greg Abbott directed counties to offer only one location for voters to drop off mail-in ballots.",
      "\u201cSo you had counties with four million people and it was one place essentially to drop off your ballot,\u201d said Chad Dunn, a longtime voting-rights lawyer. \u201cThose are provisions that would have been stopped immediately.\u201d"

      "It\u2019s been more than 18 months since the first cases of a mysterious \u201cpneumonialike illness\u201d were reported in Wuhan, China. The world still isn\u2019t any closer to understanding how the pandemic started.",
      "The director of national intelligence delivered a preliminary report to President Biden on Tuesday about the pandemic\u2019s origin. But officials have yet to answer the biggest question: whether the coronavirus was the result of an accidental leak from a Wuhan lab or whether it emerged naturally in a spillover from animals to humans.",
      "Officials have repeatedly warned that finding the precise origins of the pandemic may be more a job for scientists than spies.",
      "The absence of conclusions also underscores the challenges posed by China\u2019s refusal to cooperate with international investigations into the origin of the coronavirus.",
      "Recently, China\u2019s leaders have been promoting a fringe conspiracy theory that claims the virus came from an American military research facility. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman cited groundless claims that the coronavirus may have first leaked from Fort Detrick, Md. State media has promoted a rap song by a patriotic Chinese hip-hop group that touted the same claim, with the lyrics: \u201cHow many plots came out of your labs?\u201d",
      "Chinese officials have also punished journalists who reported on the country\u2019s failures in handling the Wuhan outbreak.",
      "Zhang Zhan, a 37-year-old citizen journalist, traveled to Wuhan in the early days of the pandemic and challenged the government\u2019s efforts to portray its initial response as competent and caring. She was imprisoned for \u201cpicking quarrels and provoking trouble,\u201d a vague charge often used to target dissent, and is now seriously ill from a hunger strike.",
      "\u201cThe government\u2019s way of managing this city has just been intimidation and threats,\u201d she said in her last video before her detention. \u201cThis is truly the tragedy of this country.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, W.H.O. experts warned that further delays could make it impossible to recover crucial evidence about the early days of the pandemic.",
      "\u201cThe window is rapidly closing on the biological feasibility of conducting the critical trace-back of people and animals inside and outside China,\u201d the experts wrote in an editorial in the journal Nature.",
      "After months of lockdown, the pews are packed on Sunday mornings at Our Lady of Lourdes in Harlem. Prayer groups meet after work and the collection plate is almost as full as it was before the pandemic began.",
      "But, as with so many houses of worship in New York City, the Delta variant is again making many worry about worshiping together.",
      "\u201cFor a little while everyone felt more free, not using masks and things like that,\u201d said the Rev. Gilberto \u00c1ngel-Neri, the church\u2019s pastor. \u201cBut now that we hear all the news about the Delta variant, everyone is using masks again.\u201d",
      "The progress made at \u00c1ngel-Neri\u2019s church, and at houses of worship across New York City, may be threatened by a rise in virus cases in the past month and by an uneven patchwork of rules governing vaccination that can differ from one place to another.",
      "While New York City has some of the strictest vaccination mandates in the country, they do not apply to religious services. Over the past year, pandemic-related rules forced many churches to shut their doors for months or limit attendance.",
      "Many houses of worship depend on in-person donations to pay their bills. Our Lady of Lourdes, for example, lost about $3,000 a week in donations when the church closed. Parishioners also lost a vital community center.",
      "\u201cFaith is a light to help you navigate through uncertainty and darkness,\u201d said John Gehring, the Catholic program director at the advocacy group Faith in Public Life. \u201cBut what a lot of people have been grappling with is what do you do when church itself becomes a place of anxiety.\u201d",
      "I work at a small hospital running a hyperbaric chamber for dive emergencies and oxygen therapy. Unfortunately, being a small place, the Covid testing is in the same area. I am 64, with lifelong Type 1 diabetes, and I contracted Covid despite being fully vaccinated. Luckily, I feel the vax helped protect me from serious complications and made my bout with it fairly short. I, however, am afraid to go back to work. I will definitely take the booster shot when I can. \u2014 Stephen Prosterman, St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands",

    "title": "",
    "content": [
      "REYNOSA, Mexico \u2014 For nearly three years under the Trump administration, a makeshift camp of migrants from all over the world operated in the Mexican city of Matamoros. It was effectively the first refugee camp on the U.S.-Mexico border, packed with people hoping to win asylum in the United States but forced to wait in Mexico while their cases were being considered.",
      "The camp, a painful sign of the human cost of the previous administration\u2019s hard-line immigration policies, was bulldozed in March. With the election of President Biden, many of its residents were allowed into the United States; others were housed safely in shelters in Mexico. Its demise seemed to signal an important move toward what Mr. Biden promised would be a new, more humane era along the border.",
      "But within weeks, a new camp sprang up about 55 miles farther west, in the Mexican city of Reynosa, and this one, aid workers say, is far worse than the one at Matamoros ever was. Overcrowded already, with more than 2,000 people, it is filthy and foul-smelling, lacking the health and sanitation infrastructure that nonprofit groups had spent months installing at Matamoros. Assaults and kidnappings for ransom are commonplace.",
      "The reason: Though Mr. Biden moved quickly to rescind the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy for asylum seekers, he left in place an emergency health order that calls for Border Patrol agents to immediately expel most migrants who cross the border, regardless of whether they try to request asylum. And on Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to block a court order directing the government to reinstate the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy, increasing the likelihood that other, similar camps will spring up along the border once again.",
      "\u201cReynosa is Matamoros on steroids,\u201d said Chloe Rastatter, co-founder of Solidarity Engineering, a nonprofit group trying to improve infrastructure in the camp. \u201cConditions in the Matamoros camp made it a palace in comparison.\u201d",
      "Every last patch of the plaza near the border bridge to Texas is covered over with a jumble of tiny tents and tarps. The small humanitarian organization has connected a short city water line, but it is not enough. There is only one handwashing tank, whose spigots often run dry. There is not enough drinking water, which is trucked in. Nor are there showers.",
      "Underfunded nonprofits and private donors are struggling to provide everything from toilet paper and disinfectant to food and medicine to the migrant families in the camp.",
      "Like the migrants in Matamoros, virtually everyone in the Reynosa camp was expelled back to Mexico, under an emergency public-health measure introduced by President Donald J. Trump, and still in effect, to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.",
      "\u201cUnder Biden, people are still being returned and getting stuck,\u201d said Charlene D\u2019Cruz, the director of Project Corazon, which provides free legal services to vulnerable migrants. \u201cThe border is not really any different.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration has said it will comply with a Texas judge\u2019s order to reinstate the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d program, officially known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, or simply M.P.P. But it is not clear whether Mexico will agree to officially cooperate with the United States to house migrants who are awaiting a decision on their asylum petitions.",
      "In any case, a majority of migrants crossing the border without authorization are being immediately expelled back to Mexico under the pandemic-related health order, regardless of their asylum status, though large numbers of unaccompanied children and many families have been allowed to enter.",
      "In their so-far-successful court challenge to the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy, the states of Texas and Missouri argued that terminating the program encouraged human smuggling and would leave the states burdened with the costs of providing services to a surge of unauthorized immigrants.",
      "Chad Wolf, who was the acting Homeland Security secretary under the Trump administration, applauded the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, saying the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy had stemmed a surge of migrants at the border and helped control \u201cthe unprecedented flood of fraudulent asylum claims.\u201d",
      "The current leadership of the Department of Homeland Security said it would begin carrying out the program again while continuing to \u201cvigorously challenge it\u201d in court on appeal. \u201cD.H.S. remains committed to building a safe, orderly and humane immigration system that upholds our laws and values,\u201d the agency said in a statement.",
      "More migrants are arriving every day in Reynosa, most of them deposited in the city by American border agents who intercepted them after they crossed the Rio Grande on a raft.",
      "Human smugglers in recent months have channeled tens of thousands of families to Tamaulipas, the state where Reynosa is, and sent them across the river to reach McAllen, Texas. In late July, the Biden administration began placing migrants on deportation flights if asylum officers posted at the border found that they would be unlikely to win their asylum cases, but it was still not clear whether the policy would deter other migrants from coming.",
      "Many of the migrants in Reynosa have fled violence, deprivation and threats to their lives. After undertaking weeks- or monthslong treks over land to come this far, most say they are disinclined to turn back. So they endure tents that leak when it rains, survive on food handouts and wear donated clothing.",
      "The poor hygiene conditions are causing people to fall ill from preventable illnesses. Chickenpox has spread among children.",
      "\u201cWe see Covid, gastrointestinal ailments from lack of clean water and a ton of infections \u2014 eye, wound, bladder,\u201d said Andrea Leiner, a nurse practitioner with Global Response Management, a medical nonprofit that has been seeing 100 patients a day under a tent.",
      "\u201cOur patients are regularly victims of assault and kidnapping,\u201d Ms. Leiner said.",
      "Last week, Mexican authorities swept through the camp by night and confiscated gas cylinders used for cooking, whipping up rumors that the camp would be shut down. But the shortage of shelter space and rampant crime in Reynosa make it unlikely that the migrants will be forcibly displaced.",
      "Since the first tents were pitched in April, a semblance of an organized community has begun to take shape.",
      "On a recent morning, a pastor climbed out of a van and a crowd quickly gathered around him to join in prayer.",
      "A sanitation crew, overseen by a Guatemalan migrant named Jimmy who hopes to make it to Cleveland one day, tried to keep a row of portable latrines cleaned. The volunteers wore latex gloves and clutched bottles of Comet cleanser.",
      "A kitchen crew distributed meals dropped off by churches to people who ate in shifts at tables under a white tent. A barber gave boys crew cuts to fend off lice, enveloping them first in a cape of red, white and blue. Children cackled as they tried to ride a rickety tricycle around the plaza\u2019s perimeter without running anyone over. Everyone was baking under the searing summer sun.",
      "The residents were united by trauma, loss and their hopes of reaching places like Alabama, Florida and Oklahoma, to name a few.",
      "Maricela, 63, had crossed into Texas with her granddaughters, 11 and 14. But after they were processed by the U.S. Border Patrol, the girls were separated from their grandmother and placed in the custody of the federal government. Maricela was bused back to Mexico because she was not their parent.",
      "Now she sat sobbing at a plastic foldout table in one the camp\u2019s improvised dining areas.",
      "\u201cI am the one who cares for them,\u201d said Maricela, who like other migrants shared only her first name because of safety concerns.",
      "The three had fled El Salvador because gang leaders had attempted to recruit the girls as sexual targets, she said. Now, she found herself equally helpless to defend them. \u201cI want to be with my granddaughters,\u201d she said.",
      "Fellow migrants, most of them complete strangers, tried to console her. A woman handed her a Bible with a blue cover, then quietly slipped away. Robert, 33, caressed her shoulders. Glenni, 21, fanned her with a kitchen rag.",
      "Several people said that they had tried to make a case for asylum to U.S. Border Patrol agents, but that the agents would not listen. They were told, they said, to just answer questions and follow directions.",
      "Within hours after arriving in the United States, these migrants said, they had been escorted to a bus that brought them back to Mexico.",
      "Lenore, 36, a migrant from Honduras, had been certain she would get in. Her husband had crossed the border two years earlier with their daughter, Jacobel, now 9, who has bone cancer, and settled in Oklahoma. She brandished a photograph of her ailing little girl.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t comprehend why they wouldn\u2019t let me pass,\u201d she said, sitting on an aluminum blanket where she has been sleeping against the pink backpack that contains everything she possesses.",
      "Nearby, inside a tent, Alma, 43, held her daughter, Alyson Sofia, 9. They too had been returned. Alma said that she had run a food stall in Honduras, but that the business became unsustainable with a steep \u201cwar tax\u201d charged by gangs. She and her daughter have twice been expelled by U.S. authorities, but she was still hoping to make it to Indianapolis, where family members who had helped pay for their journey were ready to receive them.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m waiting for the United States to allow us to enter,\u201d she said, the bridge to the United States within sight of their temporary abode. \u201cI have faith in God that it will happen.\u201d"

    "title": "In Britain, Young Children Don\u2019t Wear Masks in School",
    "content": [
      "From late spring into early summer, Britain\u2019s elementary and secondary schools were open during an alarming wave of Delta infections.",
      "And they handled the Delta spike in ways that might surprise American parents, educators and lawmakers: Masking was a limited part of the strategy. In fact, for the most part, elementary school students and their teachers did not wear them in classrooms at all.",
      "Instead, the British government focused on other safety measures, widespread quarantining and rapid testing.",
      "\u201cThe U.K. has always, from the beginning, emphasized they do not see a place for face coverings for children if it\u2019s avoidable,\u201d said Dr. Shamez Ladhani, a pediatric infectious-disease specialist at St. George\u2019s Hospital in London and an author of several government studies on the virus and schools.",
      "The potential harms exceed the potential benefits, he said, because seeing faces is \u201cimportant for the social development and interaction between people.\u201d",
      "The British school system is different than the American one. But with school systems all over the United States debating whether to require masking, Britain\u2019s experience during the Delta surge does show what happened in a country that relied on another safety measure \u2014 quarantining \u2014 rather than face coverings for young children.",
      "Unlike the United States, all public and private schools in England are expected to follow the national government\u2019s virus mandates, and there is a single set of guidelines. (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are responsible for their own schools, but the rules have been similar.)",
      "The Delta variant tested the guidelines. Starting in June, case numbers quickly increased before peaking in mid-July, which roughly mirrors the last few months of the school calendar. For the 13 million people in England under the age of 20, daily virus cases rose from about 600 in mid-May to 12,000 in mid-July, according to government data. Test positivity rates were highest among children and young adults \u2014 ages 5 to 24 \u2014 but they were also the least likely to be vaccinated.",
      "It is difficult to pinpoint exactly how much spread occurred on campuses. But throughout the pandemic, government studies showed that infection rates in schools did not exceed those in the community at large, Dr. Ladhani said. In schools that experienced multiple virus cases, he added, there were often \u201cmultiple introductions\u201d \u2014 meaning that infections were likely acquired outside the building.",
      "There is debate about whether the end of the school year in mid-July contributed to the nation\u2019s drop in virus cases, but some researchers point out that the decline began before schools closed.",
      "To counter the Delta variant during the last academic year, the government provided free rapid tests to families and asked them to test their children at home twice per week, though compliance was spotty. Students were kept in groups within the school building and sent home for 10-day quarantines if a virus case was confirmed within the bubble. More than 90 percent of school staff members had received at least one vaccine dose by the end of June, according to a government sample survey of English schools, a similar vaccination rate to American teachers in the Northeast and West, but higher than in the South.",
      "Under the government guidelines, masks in classrooms were required only for discrete periods in secondary schools, the equivalent of middle and high school, and were never required for elementary-age children.",
      "And there was less partisan divide; both the Conservative and Labour Parties have generally believed that face coverings hinder young children\u2019s ability to communicate, socialize and learn.",
      "In England, schools followed government recommendations last academic year and aggressively quarantined students and staff who came into contact with the virus.",
      "But quarantines were disruptive for students and parents and led, in mid-July, to more than 1 million children being forced out of schools, or 14 percent of the public school population. During the same period, about 7 percent of teachers were sent home.",
      "Rudo Manokore-Addy, the mother of a 7-year-old and 3-year-old in London, described herself as more cautious when it came to the virus than the typical British parent. In the spring of 2020, she encouraged her daughters to wear cloth masks outside the house. At times last summer and this past winter, she kept both girls home from school to observe the schools\u2019 virus policies before sending her children back.",
      "Last spring, during the Delta surge, she and her husband gladly kept their children in school, unmasked.",
      "\u201cI was quite relaxed,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the end, we just resolved to kind of go with it. We were confident the school had practices in place.\u201d",
      "In the United States, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends universal masking inside school buildings, and the C.D.C. has advised that breaches in mask use were likely responsible for some spread of Covid-19 in American schools.",
      "This recommendation has been divisive, with nine states attempting to ban school mask orders, according to the Center on Reinventing Public Education, a think tank. But with low vaccination rates in many communities and limited access to regular virus testing across the country, masking may be one of the easiest safety measures for American schools to put into place. In addition, the C.D.C. has said that students who come into contact with the virus in schools do not need to quarantine if both individuals wore well-fitting masks.",
      "The American conversation on masks is \u201cso polarized,\u201d said Alasdair Munro, a pediatric infectious-disease researcher at the University Hospital Southampton. \u201cIt seems to either be viewed as an essential, nonnegotiable imperative or a very harmful infringement upon individual liberty.\u201d",
      "Others in Britain would welcome masking. Dr. Deepti Gurdasani, an epidemiologist and senior lecturer at Queen Mary University of London, has spoken widely for stricter safety precautions in schools. She called the British government\u2019s opposition to masking among children \u201cideological,\u201d and said she looked with envy at the New York City school system\u2019s policies around universal masking and the placement of two air purifiers in each classroom.",
      "But there has also been quarantining in the United States, with some schools that have reopened for the new academic year temporarily closing classrooms over the past several weeks.",
      "Research from Britain suggests that rapid testing might be an alternative. In a study conducted as the Delta variant spread, secondary schools and colleges in England were randomly assigned to quarantine or test.",
      "One set of schools quarantined students and staff members who came into contact with positive Covid-19 cases. The other allowed those contacts to continue coming into the building, but with the requirement that they take a rapid virus test each day for one week; only those who tested positive would be sent home.",
      "Though the daily testing regimen was challenging for some schools to carry out, the results were reassuring: In both the quarantine and test groups, less than 2 percent of the contacts tested positive for Covid-19.",
      "Further reassuring evidence comes from testing antibodies of school staff members; positivity rates were the same or lower than adults in the community, suggesting that schools were not \u201chubs of infection,\u201d according to Public Health England, a government agency.",
      "Today, after long periods of shuttered classrooms, there is now a broad consensus in Britain that policies that keep children out of school are \u201cextremely harmful in the long term,\u201d Dr. Munro said.",
      "The national Department for Education also announced last week that in the coming school year, no one under the age of 18 would be forced to quarantine after contact with a positive virus case, regardless of vaccination status. (In Britain, vaccines are approved for individuals 16 and over.)",
      "Masks will not be required for any students or school staff, though they will be recommended in \u201cenclosed and crowded spaces where you may come into contact with people you don\u2019t normally meet,\u201d such as public transit to and from school.",
      "Some critics believe that the British government has been too quick to loosen safety measures inside schools.",
      "Dr. Gurdasani said the lack of precautions this fall would increase the number of children infected and suffering the effects of long Covid.",
      "\u201cI am not advocating for school closures,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want a generation of children disabled in the coming years.\u201d",
      "Robin Bevan, president of the National Education Union and a secondary school principal in Southend, east of London, said he found it curious that Britons regularly masked in supermarkets, but not in schools.",
      "\u201cAll we are left with is opening the windows and washing hands,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the government position.\u201d",
      "School leaders have the latitude to continue to keep children in defined bubbles or pods to reduce transmission \u2014 a practice Mr. Bevan said he would like to keep.",
      "Many parents say they are keeping calm.",
      "\u201cIt felt like in the U.K., there was such political commitment to reopening,\u201d said Bethan Roberts, 40, who felt confident returning her three children to in-person learning last spring and keeping them there during the Delta surge.",
      "\u201cIt didn\u2019t feel very controversial here,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd there were lots of exhausted parents who were just, like, \u2018We can\u2019t do this anymore.\u2019\u201d"

    "title": "Capitol Police Officers Sue Trump and Allies Over Election Lies and Jan. 6",
    "content": [
      "A group of seven Capitol Police officers filed a lawsuit on Thursday accusing former President Donald J. Trump and nearly 20 members of far-right extremist groups and political organizations of a plot to disrupt the peaceful transition of power during the Capitol riot on Jan. 6.",
      "The suit, which implicated members of the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers militia and Trump associates like Roger J. Stone Jr., was arguably the most expansive civil effort to date seeking to hold Mr. Trump and his allies legally accountable for the storming of the Capitol.",
      "While three other similar lawsuits were filed in recent months, the suit on Thursday was the first to allege that Mr. Trump worked in concert with both far-right extremists and political organizers promoting his baseless lies that the presidential election was marred by fraud.",
      "\u201cThis is probably the most comprehensive account of Jan. 6 in terms of civil cases,\u201d said Edward Caspar, a lawyer who is leading the suit for the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. \u201cIt spans from the former president to militants around him to his campaign supporters.\u201d",
      "Several police officers who served during the Capitol riot have come forward with stories of the insults and injuries they faced that day, most prominently at a congressional hearing in July. But the lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in the District of Columbia, was the first time that the seven plaintiffs, five of whom are Black, offered details of their ordeals.",
      "One of the officers, Governor Latson, was helping to secure the Senate chamber when a mob of rioters broke in and shoved him, beat him and hurled racial slurs at him, the lawsuit says. Another, Jason DeRoche, was caught in a melee on the west front steps of the Capitol, where, according to the suit, rioters pelted him with batteries and doused him with mace and bear spray, causing his eyes to swell shut.",
      "The suit contends that Mr. Trump and his co-defendants violated the Ku Klux Klan Act, an 1871 statute that includes protections against violent conspiracies that interfere with Congress\u2019s constitutional duties. It also accuses the defendants of committing \u201cbias-motivated acts of terrorism\u201d in violation of District of Columbia law.",
      "The use of civil litigation to hold Mr. Trump \u2014 and many in his orbit \u2014 accountable for the events of Jan. 6 has taken place even as the Justice Department has undertaken the largest criminal investigation in its history into the Capitol attack and a select committee of Congress has opened its own inquiry into the riot. On Wednesday, members of the committee made far-reaching requests to federal agencies for detailed records of Mr. Trump\u2019s movements and meetings on the day of the attack.",
      "The first of the lawsuits was filed in February by the N.A.A.C.P. on behalf of Democratic lawmakers who accused Mr. Trump, his former lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers of conspiring to prevent certification of the Electoral College vote on Jan. 6.",
      "In March, Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California, filed a similar complaint against Mr. Trump, Mr. Giuliani, Donald Trump Jr. and Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama, a Trump ally. That same month, two Capitol Police officers filed a suit against Mr. Trump.",
      "In each of those cases, Mr. Trump has sought to have charges dismissed by arguing that he was acting in his official capacity as president on Jan. 6 and therefore cannot face civil litigation. Other defendants, like Mr. Giuliani, have claimed that they were exercising their First Amendment rights to free speech when they spoke at rallies before the storming of the Capitol.",
      "While the new lawsuit appears to largely rely on news reports and details gleaned from criminal cases filed by the Justice Department, it takes a broad view of the origins of the attack. It argues that the conspiracy to disrupt the election started as early as May 2020, when Mr. Trump began complaining on social media that mail-in voting could \u201clead to massive fraud.\u201d",
      "The suit accuses Mr. Stone, Mr. Trump\u2019s longtime aide and ally, of echoing those and other claims, sometimes on right-wing news outlets like Infowars. Mr. Stone, who faced scrutiny early in the Justice Department\u2019s investigation, has long denied any role in the riot.",
      "At a presidential debate in September, the lawsuit notes, Mr. Trump appeared to summon members of the Proud Boys by telling them to \u201cstand back and stand by.\u201d The following month, according to the suit, Stewart Rhodes, the leader of the Oath Keepers, appeared on Infowars, predicting an impending civil war and vowing to post armed members of his group outside Washington in order to \u201csave the White House.\u201d",
      "Mr. Rhodes is also under investigation in connection with the riot and recently acknowledged that he answered questions from the F.B.I., against the advice of his lawyer.",
      "A few weeks after the election, the lawsuit says, a key organizer of the Stop the Steal movement that promoted false claims of election fraud, Ali Alexander, appeared at a rally outside the State Capitol in Georgia with the leader of the Proud Boys, Enrique Tarrio. \u201cWe\u2019re going to stop the steal,\u201d the suit quotes Mr. Alexander as saying. \u201cBut first we\u2019re going to stop the certification.\u201d",
      "Mr. Alexander\u2019s lawyer, Baron Coleman, has repeatedly said his client is not under investigation in connection with the riot. Mr. Tarrio was not in Washington on Jan. 6 but was sentenced this week to five months in prison for possessing illegal weapons and burning a Black Lives Matter flag stolen from a historic Black church in Washington after a separate pro-Trump rally in December that also descended into violence.",
      "The suit mentions other steps along the path to Jan. 6: In late November, it says, a California-based political organizer named Alan Hostetter, who believed the election was stolen, posted a video on the internet claiming that people \u201cat the highest levels\u201d needed to be \u201cmade an example of with an execution or two or three.\u201d",
      "Mr. Hostetter, who was charged in June with conspiring to storm the Capitol with members of the Three Percenter militia movement, also said in the video that he was going to return to Washington \u201cwith a million patriots, and we\u2019ll surround that city.\u201d",
      "As for Jan. 6, the suit paints a picture of Stop the Steal activists riling up the mob of Trump supporters gathered in Washington with lies about the election, which the president then echoed in a speech near the White House. Members of the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers and the Three Percenter movement, it claims, led the mob on the ground in the Capitol assault.",
      "Mr. Trump, the lawsuit says, knew that \u201cthe situation at the Capitol was dire\u201d but did not condemn the rioters. Instead, it says, he released a video two hours after the initial breach repeating his lie that the election and been stolen and telling the attackers that he loved them."

      "On Wednesday, more than 14,000 firefighters were on the front lines of 12 large wildfires in California that have burned more than 1.6 million acres, fire officials said.",
      "Unfavorable weather conditions continue to trouble crews battling the Caldor fire near Sacramento. Earlier this week, fire officials said the blaze had become a top priority after it burned more than 100,000 acres in 10 days. By Wednesday night, the fire had burned 134,000 acres and was 12 percent contained, according to a New York Times wildfire tracker. More than 450 homes had been destroyed and another 17,000 other structures were threatened, reported Cal Fire, the state\u2019s firefighting agency.",
      "Fire officials on Wednesday night said that gusty winds combined with critical fuel conditions had threatened an area north of Highway 50, one of the main routes between Sacramento and the Lake Tahoe area.",
      "Farther north, the Dixie fire, the second-largest on record in California, remains a threat to communities. That fire started six weeks ago and has since burned 747,000 acres, including the town of Greenville. It is 45 percent contained. Evacuation orders remain in place for some areas around the fire. Some residents have ignored evacuation orders, staying to tend to their cattle or to protect their homes.",
      "Amid strained firefighting resources and a crippling drought made worse by climate change, the South fire began on Wednesday near San Bernardino. The fire has burned more than 500 acres at zero percent containment and has prompted 1,000 households to evacuate, according to Cal Fire. The blaze is threatening high voltage transmission lines and at least 600 structures. About 86,000 people live within five miles of the fire, according to the Times\u2019s fire tracker.",
      "Other major blazes across California remain active, including the McFarland fire, which has burned 122,000 acres, and the Monument, which has burned 154,000 acres.",
      "An excessive heat warning is in place through Sunday for areas around San Diego, the National Weather Service said. Elevated fire weather conditions, with low relative humidity values, were expected through Saturday for communities in central California. Points north are under a heat advisory through Saturday night, with temperatures forecast to reach 110 degrees. Gusty winds were expected to develop by Friday across the Sacramento Valley.",
      "The fire potential in most of California\u2019s mountains and foothills is forecast to be higher than normal through September, and through October in areas prone to offshore winds, the National Interagency Fire Center said this month."

    "content": [
      "The chief executive of Time\u2019s Up, the prominent anti-harassment charity, resigned on Thursday, the latest fallout in a crisis that threatens the organization\u2019s survival.",
      "For weeks, the group has been in upheaval over what some survivors of sexual abuse have called a fundamental betrayal: Its leaders appear to have allied more closely with former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who faces sexual harassment allegations from 11 women, than with the first accusers to come forward.",
      "Tina Tchen, who had led the group since 2019, said in a statement that her \u201cposition at the helm of Time\u2019s Up has become a painful and divisive focal point.\u201d",
      "Explaining her decision to step aside, she said, \u201cThose very women and other activists who should be working together to fight for change are instead battling each other in harmful ways.\u201d",
      "Founded after the Harvey Weinstein revelations, backed by influential women including Oprah Winfrey and Reese Witherspoon, Time\u2019s Up has been in what its own vice chair recently called an \u201cexistential crisis\u201d over its mission. The board chair, Roberta Kaplan, also resigned over the Cuomo matter. Powerful backers like Shonda Rhimes have tried to rally support and reboot. Staff members have complained about lack of direction, and outside critics have questioned whether the organization has strayed from its founding motives.",
      "\u201cHow could @TimesUpNow have allowed itself to jeopardize the safe & powerful space it was building to protect & empower survivors?\u201d tweeted Alessandra Biaggi, a state senator in New York who has worked on sexual harassment legislation.",
      "The departure of Ms. Tchen \u2014 who served as Michelle Obama\u2019s chief of staff in the White House \u2014 raises as many questions for Time\u2019s Up as it resolves. She was a proponent of the organization\u2019s initial, bold mission: for female power players to use their connections for good. In her departing statement, Ms. Tchen endorsed that approach again. \u201cWe cannot just shout on the outside for change without helping companies, government leaders and policymakers find the solutions to do better,\u201d she said.",
      "But when dealing with Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office \u2014 and in other instances \u2014 that strategy proved compromising. Ms. Kaplan and Ms. Tchen provided feedback on an unpublished opinion column that smeared Mr. Cuomo\u2019s first accuser, Lindsay Boylan. Ms. Kaplan, a lawyer, also consulted with a top Cuomo aide about how strong a stand Time\u2019s Up should take on the allegations, The Times recently reported. And Ms. Tchen told colleagues to \u201cstand down\u201d from releasing a statement in support of Ms. Boylan, according to text messages obtained by The Washington Post.",
      "Almost since the inception of Time\u2019s Up in 2018, its small staff had expressed concerns about the expanding direction and unclear mission of the organization, and the ways in which Ms. Tchen and others operated. In June 2020, employees took their worries directly to Ms. Tchen, telling her that they believed they had strayed too far from the people they were supposed to be helping, survivors of sexual misconduct. (A separate branch, the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, provides legal support to victims.)",
      "Now, Monifa Bandele, an experienced nonprofit executive, will lead the organization on an interim basis. On Thursday, the board said it would pursue an \u201can independent investigation into how we work and how we can best accomplish our mission.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe remain committed to the work Time\u2019s Up was founded to pursue: safe, equitable and dignified work for all women,\u201d the board said in a statement.",
      "The National Women\u2019s Law Center announced on Friday that the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund would end its contract with public relations firm SKDK \u2014 a move that puts more distance between the Legal Defense Fund and Time\u2019s Up. SKDK currently manages the defense fund\u2019s program that matches harassment and assault survivors with public relations professionals. The law center will soon take over that responsibility.",
      "In a statement, the law center called the SKDK team\u2019s commitment to the Fund\u2019s goals \u201cunparalleled,\u201d but it made the decision to part ways \u201cto ensure that the independence of our work is clear to the survivors we serve.\u201d ",
      "The decision follows revelations about the Time\u2019s Up board member and SKDK managing director Hilary Rosen\u2019s involvement in the group\u2019s response to the first Cuomo allegations. A SKDK spokesperson said in a statement, \u201cWe are grateful that they will now take on this role.\u201d",
      "Publicly, the board has resolved to rebuild Time\u2019s Up. But several members said it would be a challenge. Morale is cratering.  And the board and the staff do not agree about a fundamental question raised by the Cuomo scandal: How close can the organization get to power without being tainted?",
      "Some staff members and outside critics think that Time\u2019s Up requires a systemic change beyond the recent resignations, according to interviews. \u201cTina is just simply a symptom,\u201d said Alison Turkos, a survivor advocate who spearheaded an open letter this month calling for an investigation of the group and more accountability.",

      "As stranded Spirit Airlines travelers grew desperate at San Juan Airport in Puerto Rico during a chaotic night of cancellations on Aug. 1, banging on a gate door and yelling at staff, police officers rounded up the airline\u2019s cabin crews to hide them.",
      "A 28-year-old flight attendant recounted being rushed to a jet bridge, behind a secure metal door, and then later to an office on the tarmac.",
      "There, about 35 Spirit employees were told by a manager to change out of their uniforms for their safety.",
      "\u201cWe were scared,\u201d said the attendant, who asked not to be identified by name because of the airline\u2019s media policy. \u201cI\u2019ve seen some crazy stuff, but this moved into number one.\u201d",
      "Air travelers have faced an unusually high number of disruptions this summer because of widespread labor shortages, bad weather and technical problems. Nearly a quarter of U.S. passenger planes between June and mid-August were delayed, while almost 4 percent of flights were canceled in the first half of August, according to data from Flight Aware, a flight tracking service. Spirit alone canceled nearly 2,500 flights between Aug. 1 and 15.",
      "Flight attendants across the country say they are struggling to cope, facing not only these prolonged operational issues, but also an increase in aggressive passenger behavior. Nearly 4,000 unruly passenger incidents have been reported to the Federal Aviation Administration in 2021, a figure described by the agency as \u201ca rapid and significant increase.\u201d",
      "Most of those reports deal with attendants enforcing rules on proper masking in the cabin, with passengers who range from careless to belligerent, and at times verbally or physically abusive. Shaky, vertical footage of brawls and insults are now a familiar staple on social media.",
      "A 28-year-old American Airlines flight attendant who asked not to be identified for fear of losing her job said she had law enforcement called following verbal assaults twice since June, after six years of flying with no incidents. Both confrontations were related to mask enforcement.",
      "\u201cWhat really hurts are the people who won\u2019t even look at you in the eye,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t even feel like a human anymore.\u201d",
      "In interviews with more than a dozen attendants from major and regional carriers, crew members said they were getting squeezed on both sides \u2014 from passengers and the airlines. They described regularly working shifts of more than 14 hours, being assigned up to four or five flights a day, not being given sufficient time to sleep and being deterred from taking leave if fatigued or unwell.",
      "The tense situation in the air this summer has led many attendants to say that they feel exhausted, afraid for their personal safety and, in some cases, concerned that the situation could turn dangerous.",
      "A spokeswoman for Airlines for America, a trade group, said its member airlines \u201crecognize the importance of prioritizing the safety and well-being of all employees, who are the backbone of our industry,\u201d and \u201ccomply fully with robust F.A.A. regulations, which include stringent rest requirements and limitations on duty, as well as with all federal policies.\u201d",
      "Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants union that represents nearly 50,000 flight attendants at 17 airlines, noted that the difference in passenger response to the pandemic compared with the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks has been \u201cnight and day.\u201d",
      "Twenty years ago, \u201cevery single person who came on our plane was completely on our team,\u201d she said. But now, flight attendants have become \u201cpunching bags for the public.\u201d",
      "This spring, as vaccination rates increased, coronavirus cases dropped and restrictions melted away, demand for summer travel rebounded more quickly than many had expected. On July 1, 2.1 million air travelers passed through Transportation Security Administration airport checkpoints, even more than on the same day in 2019. Many airlines ramped up their scheduling and added new routes.",
      "But while airlines are eager to capitalize on the demand, many appear to lack the staffing to keep up.",
      "Bureau of Transportation Statistics data show that the number of full-time-equivalent employees at U.S. scheduled passenger airlines was nearly 14 percent lower in June 2021 than in March 2020. Tens of thousands of flight attendants took leave during the pandemic, the A.F.A. union said. American Airlines said about 3,300 flight attendants have yet to return from leave.",
      "\u201cSo many people were let go so quickly on extended leave of absence, early retirement, that they\u2019re struggling to meet the travel demand,\u201d said Paul Hartshorn, a flight attendant and spokesman for the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, which represents about 24,000 American Airlines attendants. \u201cAnd staffing is tight, there\u2019s not a lot of wiggle room for storms and maintenance delays.\u201d",
      "At Southwest Airlines, the chief operating officer, Mike Van de Ven, shared a message with staff on Aug. 20, saying that the increase in bookings has \u201ctaken a toll on our operation and put a significant strain on all of you. And for that, I am sincerely sorry.\u201d He also said that \u201chistorical staffing models have not been effective in this pandemic environment.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not enough people,\u201d said Nas Lewis, a flight attendant with a major U.S. airline and founder of th|AIR|apy, a website and Facebook group that addresses flight attendants\u2019 mental health. Ms. Lewis, who asked that the name of her airline not be published because of its media policy, said the situation generates anxiety for attendants \u201cbecause we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to deal with on any given day.\u201d",
      "A shortage of pilots is another critical pain point for air travel, as is inadequate numbers of gate agents, baggage handlers and delivery drivers, all of which can easily throw a wrench into getting a flight out on time.",
      "When a cabin is short staffed, the airlines depend on on-call, or \u201creserve,\u201d flight attendants. This summer, airlines have been stretching their reserves to the maximum, to the point where they are running low or out of available attendants before the day has even begun.",
      "American Airlines\u2019 staff scheduling system for Chicago on Aug. 10, which a flight attendant for the company described as an average day this summer, showed that by 7 a.m. every reserve attendant based there was either already scheduled or unavailable.",
      "When an airline runs out of reserves, flight attendants who are already assigned to a flight can be abruptly rescheduled to work hours longer than expected, which attendants and union representatives say occurs more frequently now and adds to their fatigue.",
      "Jacqueline Petzel, a Chicago-based flight attendant with American Airlines who is currently working on reserve, said that during the first week of August, she was woken up repeatedly at 2 a.m. by American and had only two hours to race to the airport and then work a 15-hour shift.",
      "Between some recent shifts, Ms. Petzel, 34, said she had been given only the minimum 10 hours of rest at the hotel.",
      "During that time, she had to get dinner, shower, call family, wind down, sleep, eat breakfast and get ready for the next shift, leaving just four or five hours for actual sleep, Ms. Petzel said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to keep your eyes open when you\u2019re up that early and it\u2019s a long flight,\u201d Ms. Petzel said. On a recent layover in Las Vegas after a 15-hour day, she fell asleep in her uniform.",
      "A 30-year-old flight attendant who works with United Airlines, who asked not to be identified for fear of jeopardizing her job, said she had to work a double red-eye during a four-day trip in July.",
      "\u201cI actually felt kind of tipsy, almost kind of drunk,\u201d she said. \u201cI was slow, and I know that even if something comes up the adrenaline will kick in, but I know that my decisions aren\u2019t going to be the best.\u201d",
      "In response, Rachael Rivas, a spokeswoman for United, said: \u201cWe have what we believe is an industry-leading, safety-focused Fatigue Risk Management Program, which includes a strong collaboration between union representatives and in-flight management.\u201d",
      "Flight attendants have a maximum number of hours that they can be assigned to work, although many say scheduling teams are increasingly pressuring them to accept longer and longer shifts. When an attendant exceeds the maximum hours, it\u2019s known colloquially as \u201cgoing illegal.\u201d",
      "Attendants say it has become difficult to push back.",
      "\u201cThey have it in the computer that you\u2019re getting to the gate at 14 hours and 59 minutes, but it\u2019s obvious that\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d said the 28-year-old attendant with American, where domestic shifts are limited to 15 hours.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this saying: fly now, grieve later,\u201d she said. \u201cYou fly the illegal reassignment now, and you grieve it with your union later.\u201d",
      "Whitney Zastrow, a spokeswoman for American Airlines, said, \u201cwe\u2019ve taken and continue to take steps to materially improve the quality of our flight attendants\u2019 work life, including working closely with our hotel and limo vendor.\u201d",
      "A video circulating online earlier this month of Frontier flight attendants duct taping a belligerent passenger to his seat made news reports and shocked viewers. While this is an extreme incident, attendants and unions say that encountering unruly passengers, once rare, is now almost expected.",
      "An F.A.A. spokeswoman said that before 2021, the numbers of disturbances were fairly consistent year over year, with the agency investigating on average less than 150 incidents annually. As of Aug. 23, the F.A.A. has launched investigations into 693 incidents in 2021.",
      "\u201cYou would think a pandemic affecting a ton of people would cause people to maybe pause and be more compassionate to each other,\u201d said Ms. Petzel, the American Airlines attendant. \u201cFor whatever reason, it\u2019s made it go the complete other way.\u201d",
      "Flight attendants across many airlines say the situation is wearing on their mental health and physical well-being.",
      "\u201cI have never experienced this level of anxiety, depression in my entire life,\u201d said the 28-year-old flight attendant who works for American. \u201cWe\u2019re really breaking down.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re used to getting B.S. from the company, from the passengers, we\u2019re used to weather \u2014 but not all at the same time for an extended period of time. It\u2019s every single day, it\u2019s every single trip,\u201d she said.",
      "Many attendants say they fear retribution for taking leave, especially now.",
      "Some airlines have a point-based attendance policy, whereby if a flight attendant has an unplanned absence when scheduled to work (say, because they call in sick), they accrue a point. Too many points can trigger an investigation or even termination.",
      "JetBlue warned crew members that they would incur double attendance points if they took an unplanned absence over a weekend between July 23 through to Labor Day weekend.",
      "One JetBlue flight attendant, who requested anonymity for fear of losing his job, said that last month he worked more than 17 hours on a shift and had been given only the legal minimum amount of rest, eight hours, between some flights.",
      "He has called in sick a number of times but worries that he may accrue too many attendance points and face termination.",
      "\u201cWhen you try to talk to people about it, they say, \u2018This is what you signed up for,\u2019\u201d he said, referring to a conversation he had with his manager.",
      "\u201cOur attendance policy is similar to most airlines, and on peak periods (like holidays) it\u2019s especially important that crew members show up for assigned trips so that customers can get where they plan on going,\u201d said Derek Dombrowski, a JetBlue spokesman. JetBlue is also offering financial incentives to encourage crews to take shifts.",
      "Normally, Southwest Airlines is contractually obliged to let attendants call in sick without requiring a physician\u2019s note. But the company can invoke an \u201cemergency sick-call procedure,\u201d requiring staff to verify their illness with a company doctor. Southwest has invoked this policy three times this summer.",
      "\u201cIt should not be used as a usual or normal way of controlling the operation,\u201d said Lyn Montgomery, the president of Transport Workers Union Local 556, which represents Southwest Airlines flight attendants. The last time this procedure was used was in 2017.",
      "\u201cWhile never a desired option, Southwest may, when operationally necessary, enact emergency sick call procedures to protect the airline\u2019s schedule and support working flight attendants,\u201d said Brian Parrish, a spokesman for Southwest Airlines. \u201cSouthwest Airlines supports employees\u2019 physical, emotional and mental health with a variety of programs and offerings \u2014 including free employee assistance services that are available 24/7.\u201d",
      "The union and attendants said they felt that these doctors could be dismissive of symptoms. Staff also may not feel comfortable seeing the airline\u2019s doctor, especially if dealing with mental health concerns.",
      "\u201cOur mental health has never been more disrupted than now, obviously since 9/11,\u201d said a 30-year-old flight attendant for Southwest, who asked not to be identified for fear of losing her job. \u201cYou can\u2019t even call out sick if you\u2019re having major anxiety or depression episodes. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d",
      "Ms. Lewis, of th|AIR|apy, said in May she was shoved by a hostile passenger who was upset about an overbooked flight. She did not report the incident, she said, because she was too exhausted.",
      "\u201cAs flight attendants, we are at our wits\u2019 end,\u201d she said.",

    "content": [
      "\u2014 Jane Cunningham, one of the authors of \u201cBrandsplaining: Why Marketing is (Still) Sexist And How To Fix It.\u201d",
      "In 2019, Jane Cunningham and Philippa Roberts \u2014 founders of a marketing consultancy \u2014 were invited to a conference to speak about how the marketing industry was failing women. Over 15 years, they\u2019d conducted 4,000 hours\u2019 worth of interviews and discussion groups with women about their needs, their desires and where brands were falling short. And brands were really falling short.",
      "As they were about to go onstage, a man in attendance introduced himself and explained that their expertise was not needed \u2014 as far as ads were concerned, inequality between the sexes had ended. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous. I don\u2019t think there is any problem with marketing to women now,\u201d they recounted the man saying.",
      "Before Ms. Cunningham and Ms. Roberts could stick it to him, and tell him why he was wrong, he simply strode off.",
      "So begins their book, \u201cBrandsplaining: Why Marketing is (Still) Sexist And How To Fix It.\u201d The title is a nod to Rebecca Solnit\u2019s concept of mansplaining, a term that refers to a man explaining things to a woman, unsolicited, and whether he is an expert on the topic or not.",
      "Back when they worked at ad agencies in the early 2000s, Ms. Roberts and Ms. Cunningham were \u2014 as women on the team \u2014 commonly assigned the accounts that targeted women, for products such as feminine hygiene items, laundry detergents and cleaning supplies. \u201cWhen we presented our briefs, there was a glazed unresponsive feel to the meetings,\u201d Ms. Cunningham said.",
      "Over and over again, \u201cWe noticed how female customers were perceived in ways that were at best inaccurate and at worst diminishing and dismissive,\u201d they wrote.",
      "Between 1980 and 2010, women in commercials were shown in workplace settings only 4 percent of the time; frequently they were shown in kitchens, waxing poetic about the products they were selling. They were shown in kitchens so often that creatives referred to the trope in whispers as 2Cs in a K. \u201cThe K was for kitchen and you can guess what the Cs stood for,\u201d they wrote.",
      "Since then, little has changed. In 2019, the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media found that ads up for awards at the prestigious Cannes Lions advertising festival depicted male characters working almost twice as often as female characters. Male characters also outnumbered female characters two-to-one and had twice as much screen time and speaking time. Another study conducted by Ebiquity, a media consultancy, found that, of the ads aired in 2016, only 4 percent showed women in leadership positions.",
      "According to Ms. Cunningham and Ms. Roberts, part of the inequality has stemmed from who fills high-level roles inside advertising agencies. While there are about equal numbers of women and men in advertising overall, 71 percent of creative directors \u2014 the role with the most creative control \u2014 are men.",
      "In 2019, the Advertising Standards Authority in the United Kingdom banned advertisements that depicted gender stereotypes \u2014 no more commercials where only women scrub the floors or where men are dumbfounded by the workings of a diaper. The U.K. standards are certainly more robust than those in the U.S., said Brooke Erin Duffy, an associate professor of communication at Cornell. But the U.K. also wasn\u2019t the first to take action: Several countries have laws and codes on the books that, to varying degrees, prevent gender discrimination.",
      "In their book, Ms. Cunningham and Ms. Roberts argue that despite women\u2019s progress in many parts of society, advertisements still consistently cast women as secondary. \u201cThe majority of brands still speak to women from a male perspective, explaining to them what they are and telling them what they can be,\u201d they write.",
      "In Her Words spoke with Ms. Cunningham and Ms. Roberts over Zoom to discuss the lingering and often covert sexism in marketing.",
      "The conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "What does marketing to women look like in 2021?",
      "Roberts: Brands appear to be presenting a more positive and progressive message for women, but in reality, all that\u2019s happened is a trick of the language. Age-defying has turned into \u201cageless\u201d and dieting has coded itself as \u201cwellness.\u201d In the book we describe this as \u201csneaky sexism.\u201d The guy in the white lab coat has become this silky shrink voice \u2014 lean into this, you can be anything, be bold, be strong \u2014 which puts the onus on the individual to change themselves and, this time, their behavior, not just their appearance.",
      "When it comes to marketing, what do women say they want, but aren\u2019t getting?",
      "Cunningham: The fundamental misunderstanding in the way that marketing models work is the perception that women\u2019s aim and ambition in life starts and stops with achieving male approval and patronage. In essence, getting married and having kids. Everything leading up to that is preparation and training to achieve it, and everything after that is a decline into beige-ness and invisibility. So for kids, marketing to girls is all about being kind, being sweet, being affectionate, looking after things. For young women, it\u2019s all about your appearance, making sure you\u2019re always as perfect as you possibly can be in order to seek and achieve male approval, and then of course you become the perfect mom, delighted and endlessly happy to have this baby.",
      "But when you actually talk to women, their aspirations are not, in fact, to be beautiful through the male lens; it\u2019s to feel comfortable in their own skin. It isn\u2019t to be dependent; it\u2019s to maintain their independence, particularly their financial independence.",
      "The great female-made brands that we talk about in the book, like Frida Mom or Third Love, make women feel seen as they are, not as men want them to be. That\u2019s the big shift that needs to happen. Brands need to stop telling women how to be, and start being in service to them.",
      "But big brands have long had success with criticizing women to sell products.",
      "Cunningham: Even if these smaller brands are not a direct threat to the bigger and more traditional brands, they are throwing into relief just how outmoded and old-fashioned big-brand marketing is. Once you\u2019ve seen Frida Mom, a lot of the stuff that comes out of traditional brands starts to look really strange, really twisted and untrue.",
      "How big of a role is social media in changing this?",
      "Cunningham: Historically there weren\u2019t channels available to women to talk to each other about how objectionable they found this stuff. Women were sort of forced to consume it. They didn\u2019t really know whether everybody else was thinking, \u201cwait a minute, this seems pretty punishing.\u201d But now social media, for all of its faults, has also been a brilliant way for women to discuss what they find really objectionable about brands, and it\u2019s been galvanizing.",
      "Does the way things are marketed have a real impact on gender identity and self-concept?",
      "Cunningham: There is a really big body of work around the impact of marketing and just how powerful it is \u2014 young women are consuming something like 10,000 messages a day from brands. Think about the collective impact that can have when the same things are being said over and over again, which are usually: Be thinner, be blonder, be more feminine, be hairless, be whiter.",
      "Cumulatively, it does have an effect. But why not sell products in a way that is going to have a positive effect on women, not just young women but all women? Why does it have to be so fraught? Women have enough real problems that need to be solved by brands and products, you don\u2019t need to make them up.",
      "How does marketing aimed at men differ?",
      "Cunningham: The themes are very different. They are about power, individualism and strength.",
      "Roberts: The nature of the relationship in the masculine space is much more endorsing and positive. That critical eye just isn\u2019t there; it\u2019s more of we see you, we endorse you and we really like you.",
      "You write that brands even spend more on ads targeting men.",
      "Cunningham: Yes, we talk about the domestic brands, the brands like Pampers or Tide. If they decide to target the male audience instead of doling out the usual slice-of-life formula that women get in marketing, out comes John Legend and hilarious jokes and brilliant high production values as if with men you have to be properly creative. Whereas women don\u2019t need that, you can give them any old rubbish and they will happily receive the message because they are so invested in laundry detergent or nappies.",
      "It was such a fascinating statistic from your book that 20 percent of commercials depict a woman with her head thrown back laughing.",
      "Cunningham: Yeah, and never being funny. Only 3 percent of ads are women being funny themselves.",
      "Roberts: And they are almost always smiling, and if they aren\u2019t smiling, they are looking really hostile; it\u2019s very polar.",
      "Cunningham: And, you know, the older woman completely disappears. Only one in 10 ads that feature a woman features a woman who\u2019s over 50.",
      "It\u2019s a huge missed opportunity. Also older women are fed up with looking at marketing that just features women under 30.",
      "Yeah, if you only watched ads, you\u2019d think older women just have bladder issues.",
      "Cunningham: Or that they are a bit bonkers. They are sort of, you know, ditsy and eccentric and odd. They can\u2019t just be women who are over 50 and getting on with their lives who have jobs and children.",
      "Roberts: It\u2019s not just older women who get overlooked. It\u2019s women of color. Poor women. Massive swaths that just don\u2019t get seen because of this narrow way that marketing has set its dials, which is around this good, white, slim, young, pleasing archetype.",
      "Cunningham: If you talk to these marketing executives about this, you know, they say, \u201cBut won\u2019t that put everybody else off if you show older women?\u201d First of all, who cares, because older women have the money. But also no, younger women don\u2019t go around saying, \u201cEw, she\u2019s over 50, how disgusting!\u201d It\u2019d be more like, \u201cThank god, I have some role models now.\u201d It\u2019s just a complete misunderstanding about the way that women think.",
      "As consumers, what power do we have to change how products are marketed?",
      "Cunningham: The way that women can influence marketing is spending with the brands that are doing the right thing by women and refusing to buy from brands that are very evidently trying to keep women in their place, and/or the place they think women should be.",

    "content": [
      "Hurricane Ida twice made landfall as a Category 4 storm on Sunday morning along the Gulf Coast, where people were riding out what officials said could be the strongest hurricane to hit Louisiana in at least 165 years.",
      "Ida made landfall near Port Fourchon just before noon local time before it again made landfall two hours later in Lafourche Parish on the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina.",
      "By Sunday evening, its maximum sustained winds were reported to be 125 m.p.h., making it a Category 3 storm. Rapid weakening was expected over the next day or so but Ida was forecast to remain a hurricane through late Sunday night and a tropical storm until Monday afternoon, the National Hurricane Center said.",
      "More than 560,000 people were without power across Louisiana as of Sunday afternoon, according to reports from utility companies compiled by PowerOutage.us.",
      "Officials warned that Ida would hit Louisiana as an \u201cextremely dangerous major hurricane.\u201d",
      "Mayor LaToya Cantrell of New Orleans urged residents to \u201chunker down\u201d in one place until Monday. \u201cThis is the time to stay inside, do not venture out,\u201d she said at a news briefing on Sunday.",
      "The city authorities sternly warned residents not to go to hospitals or seek emergency services on Sunday. Shortly after Ida made landfall, the New Orleans Emergency Medical Services said it would not respond to emergency calls until it was safe for emergency crews to venture out.",
      "Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana said on Saturday that Ida would be the strongest storm to hit the state since at least the 1850s. In 1856, a hurricane leveled Louisiana\u2019s Last Island and killed more than 200 people, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "The governor said that patients in coastal hospitals could not be evacuated to inland facilities because the state\u2019s hospitals were stretched to capacity amid Louisiana\u2019s highest-ever surge of Covid-19 infections. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any place to bring those patients \u2014 not in state, not out of state,\u201d he said.",
      "Sunday is the 16th anniversary of Katrina, and Ida\u2019s path was stirring painful reminders of the death and devastation it wrought and the psychological scars that still run deep in the city.",
      "Ramsey Green, the deputy chief administrative officer for infrastructure in New Orleans, said on Sunday that the city was in a much better position today than it was during Hurricane Katrina. He said that while he was confident that the city\u2019s levee system will withstand the deluge, he was concerned about floods once the rainfall \u201cgreatly exceeds our existing drainage ability.\u201d",
      "After the storm churns through Louisiana, it was forecast to turn toward western Mississippi on Monday and Tennessee Valley on Tuesday. Areas as far as the Mid-Atlantic could expect up to six inches of rain from Ida on Tuesday and Wednesday, the center said.",
      "It has been a dizzying few weeks for meteorologists who monitored three named storms that formed in quick succession in the Atlantic, bringing stormy weather, flooding and damaging winds to different parts of the United States and the Caribbean.",
      "First came Tropical Storm Fred, which made landfall on Aug. 16 in the Florida Panhandle. As Fred moved across the Southeast, it brought heavy rains and touched off several tornadoes. At least five people were killed after flash floods wiped out homes in western North Carolina in the wake of the storm.",
      "Grace formed in the eastern Caribbean on Aug. 14, the same day a 7.2-magnitude earthquake rocked Haiti\u2019s western peninsula. The storm quickly moved west as the country struggled to free people trapped in rubble, bringing at least 10 inches of rain. Grace then made another landfall on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, bringing more heavy rain, power failures and hundreds of evacuations. A third landfall, on the eastern coast of Mexico\u2019s mainland, left at least eight people dead.",
      "And Henri formed on Aug. 16 as a tropical storm off the East Coast of the United States.",
      "It strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane but was downgraded before making landfall in Rhode Island, sparing the region the worst of what had been predicted. It thrashed the Northeast with fierce winds and torrential rain, knocking out power to more than 140,000 households from New Jersey to Maine. Some communities in Connecticut were evacuated and rainfall records in New York City were shattered.",
      "The links between hurricanes and climate change are becoming more apparent. A warming planet can expect to see stronger hurricanes over time, and a higher incidence of the most powerful storms \u2014 though the overall number of storms could drop because factors like stronger wind shear could keep weaker storms from forming.",
      "Hurricanes are also becoming wetter because of more water vapor in the warmer atmosphere; scientists have suggested that storms like Hurricane Harvey in 2017 produced far more rain than they would have without the human effects on climate. Also, rising sea levels are contributing to higher storm surges \u2014 the most destructive element of tropical cyclones.",
      "Ana became the first named storm of the season on May 23, making this the seventh year in a row that a named storm developed in the Atlantic before the official start of the season on June 1.",
      "In May, scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast that there would be 13 to 20 named storms this year, six to 10 of which would be hurricanes, and three to five major hurricanes of Category 3 or higher in the Atlantic. In early August, in a midseason update to the forecast, they continued to warn that this year\u2019s hurricane season would be an above average one, suggesting a busy end to the season.",
      "Matthew Rosencrans of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that an updated forecast suggested that there would be 15 to 21 named storms, including seven to 10 hurricanes, by the end of the season on Nov. 30. Ida is the ninth named storm of 2021.",
      "Last year, there were 30 named storms, including six major hurricanes, forcing meteorologists to exhaust the alphabet for the second time and move to using Greek letters.",
      "It was the highest number of storms on record, surpassing the 28 from 2005, and included the second-highest number of hurricanes on record."

Pete Ricketts of Nebraska declared a staffing emergency for the state\u2019s hospitals. New cases in Nebraska have jumped, with hospitalizations rising to the highest level since January, according to a New York Times database.",
      "The governor said he would issue an executive order that will make it easier for hospitals to hire nurses. The order will waive licensing requirements for hospitals in order to authorize credentials for retired or inactive nurses, defer some continuing education requirements and suspend statutes concerning new health care providers who are seeking a license to practice.",
      "Nebraska\u2019s nurses, like health care workers across the country, are a year and a half into a relentless battle to care for Covid patients. The latest and most severe cases, across the country, are among those who have yet to be vaccinated.",
      "As the highly contagious Delta variant pummels the United States, nurses are reporting that they feel depleted and traumatized, their ranks thinned by early retirements or career shifts that traded the emergency room for less stressful jobs.",
      "Gov. Ricketts, a Republican, directed the state authorities to recruit unvaccinated nurses, said Taylor Gage, a spokesman for the governor.",
      "\u201cThe state responded with this campaign so nurses throughout Nebraska know that state government is an alternative career choice,\u201d Mr. Gage said in a statement.",

      "Ms. Blood said on Wednesday night that she had not received a reply from the governor\u2019s office.",
      "The surge is being driven by the highly contagious Delta variant and low vaccination rates, health experts said. The authorities in Nebraska are struggling to vaccinate its citizens, with only 57 percent of people at least partially vaccinated. The national rate is 61 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Gov. Ricketts also announced Thursday a directed health measure to limit elective surgeries that will take effect on Monday.",
      "The statewide limitations comes days after Nebraska Medicine, Methodist Health, and Bryan Health announced that they would suspend elective surgeries to preserve hospital capacity. Nebraska Medicine cited the nursing shortage as a factor in its decision.",

    "content": [
      "The only defendant to plead guilty to taking part in a plot to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan was sentenced on Wednesday to six years and three months in prison.",
      "Ty G. Garbin, 25, an airplane mechanic, was the first defendant to be sentenced for what prosecutors have described as an extremist plot driven by anger at the governor\u2019s efforts to slow the spread of the coronavirus.",
      "The 14 men arrested in October face charges in federal and state courts in one of the most significant domestic terrorism plots ever to come to trial in the United States. The defendants, many of them members of an antigovernment paramilitary group in Michigan called the Wolverine Watchmen, coalesced around protests against Covid-19 lockdown measures.",
      "After initially weighing storming the State Capitol in Lansing, they decided to abduct Governor Whitmer from her vacation home, according to prosecutors. Their efforts were seen as a precursor to the violence unleashed at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.",
      "Mr. Garbin cooperated extensively with the prosecutors, who called his \u201cwide-ranging insider\u2019s view\u201d a significant contribution to the case. Among other issues, he testified about plans to deploy a homemade explosive device as well as other illegal weapons. His testimony resulted in added federal charges being brought against three of the men in April. The extent of Mr. Garbin\u2019s cooperation led officials to move him to a different prison from the others, prosecutors said in court papers.",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Garbin apologized to Ms. Whitmer and her family for the \u201cstress and fear\u201d that he caused. Ms. Whitmer wrote a victim impact statement for the court that, while acknowledging that forgiveness was important, noted that danger from similar groups still exists. \u201cKidnapping plots and death threats endanger not just individuals, but democracy itself,\u201d she wrote in part.",
      "The sentence on Wednesday in federal court in Grand Rapids, Mich., was just one part of the complex legal proceedings surrounding the case. Adherents of paramilitary movements from as far away as Delaware and Wisconsin are among the accused, with the six defendants facing federal charges set to go on trial on Oct. 12. The remaining eight, who are charged with assisting them, will be tried in two different state courts.",
      "Federal prosecutors had asked for a nine-year sentence for Mr. Garbin. Mr. Garbin and most of the men in the Michigan case were inspired by the so-called boogaloo movement, the authorities say.",
      "Boogaloo followers \u2014 the name is drawn from a cult film \u2014 believe that the United States is on the brink of a civil war that devotees seek to accelerate.",
      "\u201cSuch accelerationist groups are widespread and proliferating,\u201d federal prosecutors wrote in their sentencing memorandum, using the Capitol riot on Jan. 6 as an example of the potential for chaos.",
      "A strong sentence would discourage imitators, the prosecutors wrote, while \u201can insufficient sentence will encourage such groups to plot and prepare.\u201d",

      "In California, Steven Carrillo, an active-duty Air Force sergeant, pleaded not guilty and awaits trial in the shooting death of a federal security officer outside a courthouse in Oakland in May 2020 as well as the killing of a sheriff\u2019s deputy in Santa Cruz County a few days later.",
      "During the shootout that led to his arrest, Sergeant Carrillo used his own blood to scrawl \u201cBoog\u201d and other phrases linked to the movement on the hood of a car he had stolen. On Monday, one of four members of the antigovernment Grizzly Scouts paramilitary group linked to Mr. Carrillo pleaded guilty in federal court in California to destroying evidence in the case.",
      "In Las Vegas, three boogaloo followers who were arrested in May 2020 are expected to go on trial in January. They are accused of trying to incite violence after plotting to throw firebombs during a Black Lives Matter protest. They also face state terrorism charges.",
      "Mr. Garbin, frustrated by pay cuts during the pandemic, struggled between considering himself a patriot taking concrete action against the government-mandated shutdown and telling himself that he had done nothing illegal, his lawyer, Gary K. Springstead, wrote in court papers. Mr. Garbin recognized after his arrest that casing the governor\u2019s vacation home went beyond free speech protests, his lawyer said.",
      "Nine years was a reduction from the sentencing guidelines of about 14 to 17 years.",
      "Mr. Garbin\u2019s lawyers had argued for an even more substantial reduction, citing his quick acceptance of responsibility for his actions; the fact that he might face retribution in prison for cooperating with the federal authorities; his lack of any prior criminal record; and a history of being physically abused by his father. In addition, he had joined a deradicalization program, they noted.",
      "For the men still facing trial, the central argument used by defense lawyers in court papers thus far has been entrapment, accusing the main F.B.I. informant who penetrated the group as well as various other informants or undercover agents of pushing the plot along.",
      "Lawyers for three defendants who first appeared in state court in Jackson County last March made similar arguments. The trial of five others in Antrim County has yet to begin.",
      "The government made clear on Wednesday that it would rely heavily on Mr. Garbin\u2019s extensive cooperation during the trial of the other defendants. Lengthy testimony and repeated debriefings have been critical in building a case to counter defense arguments that revolve around free speech issues as well as accusations of entrapment by federal undercover informants, Nils R. Kessler, the lead U.S. attorney on the case, said in court.",
      "\u201cHaving someone who is part of this agreement saying that it wasn\u2019t just big talk, we really meant to do it, is a huge thing,\u201d Mr. Kessler said. \u201cIt is going to be important to the jury when he testifies.\u201d"

    "content": [
      "A federal judge in Michigan on Wednesday night ordered sanctions to be levied against nine pro-Trump lawyers, including Sidney Powell and L. Lin Wood, ruling that a lawsuit laden with conspiracy theories that they filed last year challenging the validity of the presidential election was \u201ca historic and profound abuse of the judicial process.\u201d",
      "In her decision, Judge Linda V. Parker of the Federal District Court in Detroit ordered the lawyers to be referred to the local legal authorities in their home states for possible suspension or disbarment.",
      "Declaring that the lawsuit should never have been filed, Judge Parker wrote in her 110-page order that it was \u201cone thing to take on the charge of vindicating rights associated with an allegedly fraudulent election,\u201d but another to deceive \u201ca federal court and the American people into believing that rights were infringed.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is what happened here,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Ms. Powell and Mr. Wood did not respond immediately to comment on the ruling. The other lawyers, including two who served in the Trump administration, could not be reached on Wednesday night for comment.",
      "The Michigan lawsuit, filed in late November, was one of four legal actions, collectively known as the \u201cKraken\u201d suits, that Ms. Powell filed in courts around the country, claiming that tabulation machines made by Dominion Voting Systems were tampered with by a bizarre set of characters, such as the financier George Soros or Venezuelan intelligence agents. In the suits, she complained without merit that those conspirators began a complicated, covert plot to digitally flip votes from President Donald J. Trump to his opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr.",
      "Judge Parker\u2019s order came about a month after a marathon hearing during which she repeatedly pressed Ms. Powell and her colleagues about how \u2014 or even whether \u2014 they had verified the statements of witnesses who filed sworn statements making claims of widespread fraud and tampering with voting machines. Several times, Judge Parker expressed astonishment at the lawyers\u2019 answers, telling them they had a responsibility to perform \u201cminimal due diligence\u201d and calling some of the lawsuit\u2019s claims \u201cfantastical.\u201d",
      "In her decision, Judge Parker accused Ms. Powell, who is based in Dallas, and Mr. Wood, who is based in Atlanta, of abusing \u201cthe well-established rules\u201d of litigation by making claims that were backed by neither the law nor evidence, but were instead marked by \u201cspeculation, conjecture and unwarranted suspicion.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis case was never about fraud,\u201d Judge Parker wrote. \u201cIt was about undermining the people\u2019s faith in our democracy and debasing the judicial process to do so.\u201d",
      "David Fink, a lawyer for the City of Detroit, called the ruling \u201ca powerful message to attorneys everywhere.\u201d",
      "\u201cFollow the rules, stick to the truth or pay a price,\u201d Mr. Fink said. \u201cLawyers will now know that there are consequences for filing frivolous lawsuits.\u201d",
      "Judge Parker\u2019s order, which said Ms. Powell and her colleagues had \u201cscorned their oath, flouted the rules and attempted to undermine the integrity of the judiciary,\u201d was the latest legal setback for the embattled group of lawyers who emerged from the postelection period as the most die-hard of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters.",
      "The former president and his allies filed more than 60 lawsuits challenging the election last year, losing nearly all of them. None were more outrageous \u2014 or lacking in proof \u2014 than those filed by Ms. Powell, positing a conspiracy of international intelligence operatives manipulating the election results by hacking into voting machines.",
      "Dominion ultimately sued Ms. Powell and others, including Mr. Trump\u2019s former lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, for defamation, accusing them of initiating \u201ca viral disinformation campaign\u201d about the election and seeking damages of more than $1 billion. Those lawsuits were allowed to proceed to trial this month after a federal judge in Washington denied Ms. Powell\u2019s and Mr. Giuliani\u2019s motions to dismiss."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to block a ruling from a federal judge in Texas requiring the Biden administration to reinstate a Trump-era immigration program that forces asylum seekers arriving at the southwestern border to await approval in Mexico.",
      "The court\u2019s brief unsigned order said that the administration had appeared to act arbitrarily and capriciously in rescinding the program, citing a decision last year refusing to let the Trump administration rescind the Obama-era program protecting the young immigrants known as dreamers.",
      "The court\u2019s three more liberal members \u2014 Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan \u2014 said they would have granted a stay of the trial judge\u2019s ruling. They did not give reasons. The case will now be heard by an appeals court and may return to the Supreme Court.",
      "The challenged program, known commonly as Remain in Mexico and formally as the Migrant Protection Protocols, applies to people who left a third country and traveled through Mexico to reach the U.S. border. After the policy was put in place at the beginning of 2019, tens of thousands of people waited for immigration hearings in unsanitary tent encampments exposed to the elements. There have been widespread reports of sexual assault, kidnapping and torture.",
      "President Biden suspended and then ended the program. Texas and Missouri sued, saying they had been injured by the termination by having to provide government services like drivers\u2019 licenses to immigrants allowed into the United States under the program.",
      "On Aug. 13, Judge Matthew J. Kacsmaryk of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, in Amarillo, ruled that a federal law required returning noncitizens seeking asylum to Mexico whenever the government lacked the resources to detain them.",
      "That was a novel reading of the law, the acting solicitor general, Brian H. Fletcher, told the justices. That view had \u201cnever been accepted by any presidential administration since the statute\u2019s enactment in 1996,\u201d including the Trump administration, he said.",
      "Judge Kacsmaryk suspended his ruling for a week, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, refused to give the administration a further stay while it pursued an appeal, prompting an emergency application for a stay in the Supreme Court. On Friday, shortly before the ruling was to go into effect, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. issued a short stay to allow the full Supreme Court to consider the matter.",
      "The Supreme Court has had previous encounters with the program. In response to an emergency application from the Trump administration, the court revived the program last year after a federal appeals court blocked it.",
      "The justices later agreed to hear the Trump administration\u2019s appeal from a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which had blocked the law, saying it was at odds with federal law and international treaties and was causing \u201cextreme and irreversible harm.\u201d But the Supreme Court dismissed the case in June in response to a request from the Biden administration.",
      "Mr. Fletcher urged the justices to give the Biden administration the same deference it had afforded the Trump administration.",

      "Omar Jadwat, the director of the A.C.L.U.\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, said the Biden administration had been correct to rescind the Remain in Mexico program.",

      "Mr. Fletcher noted that the executive branch had broad authority over immigration. \u201cThe district court\u2019s injunction,\u201d he wrote, \u201ceffectively dictates the United States\u2019 foreign policy.\u201d"

    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected the Biden administration\u2019s latest moratorium on evictions, ending a political and legal dispute during a public health crisis in which the administration\u2019s shifting positions had subjected it to criticism from adversaries and allies alike.",
      "The court issued an eight-page majority opinion, an unusual move in a ruling on an application for emergency relief, where terse orders are more common. The court\u2019s three liberal justices dissented.",
      "The decision puts hundreds of thousands of tenants at risk of losing shelter, while the administration struggles to speed the flow of billions of dollars in federal funding to people who are behind in rent because of the coronavirus pandemic and its associated economic hardship. Only about $5.1 billion of the $46.5 billion in aid had been disbursed by the end of July, according to figures released on Wednesday, as bureaucratic delays at the state and local levels snarled payouts.",
      "The majority opinion, which was unsigned, said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had exceeded its authority.",
      "\u201cThe C.D.C. has imposed a nationwide moratorium on evictions in reliance on a decades-old statute that authorizes it to implement measures like fumigation and pest extermination,\u201d the opinion said. \u201cIt strains credulity to believe that this statute grants the C.D.C. the sweeping authority that it asserts.\u201d",
      "Justice Stephen G. Breyer, writing for the three dissenting justices, faulted the court for its haste during a public health crisis.",
      "\u201cThese questions call for considered decision-making, informed by full briefing and argument,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTheir answers impact the health of millions. We should not set aside the C.D.C.\u2019s eviction moratorium in this summary proceeding.\u201d",
      "The majority said the issues were fully considered and straightforward. \u201cIt is indisputable that the public has a strong interest in combating the spread of the Covid-19 Delta variant,\u201d the opinion said. \u201cBut our system does not permit agencies to act unlawfully even in pursuit of desirable ends.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf a federally imposed eviction moratorium is to continue,\u201d the opinion said, \u201cCongress must specifically authorize it.\u201d",
      "In dissent, Justice Breyer wrote that \u201cthe public interest is not favored by the spread of disease or a court\u2019s second-guessing of the C.D.C.\u2019s judgment.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration and other moratorium proponents predicted that the decision would set off a wave of dire consequences.",
      "\u201cAs a result of this ruling, families will face the painful impact of evictions, and communities across the country will face greater risk of exposure to Covid-19,\u201d Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said in a statement.",
      "The ruling also renewed pressure on congressional Democrats to try to extend the freeze over the opposition of Republicans.",
      "\u201cTonight, the Supreme Court failed to protect the 11 million households across our country from violent eviction in the middle of a deadly global pandemic,\u201d said Representative Cori Bush, a Missouri Democrat who slept on the steps of the Capitol this month to protest the expiration of the previous moratorium. \u201cWe already know who is going to bear the brunt of this disastrous decision: Black and brown communities, and especially Black women.\u201d",
      "But landlords, who have said the moratoriums saddled them with billions of dollars in debt, hailed the move.",
      "\u201cThe government must move past failed policies and begin to seriously address the nation\u2019s debt tsunami, which is crippling both renters and housing providers alike,\u201d said Bob Pinnegar, the president of the National Apartment Association, a trade association representing large landlords.",
      "It will most likely take a while for the backlog of eviction cases in many states to result in the displacement of renters. But tenant groups in the South, where fast-track evictions are common, are bracing for the worst.",
      "In recent days, Mr. Biden\u2019s team has been mapping out strategies to deal with the likely loss of the moratorium, with a plan to focus its efforts on a handful of states \u2014 including South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and Ohio \u2014 that have large backlogs of unpaid rent and few statewide protections for tenants.",
      "The administration had at first concluded that a Supreme Court ruling in June had effectively forbidden it from imposing a new moratorium after an earlier one expired at the end of July. While the administration had prevailed in that ruling by a 5-to-4 vote, one member of the majority, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, wrote that he believed the moratorium to be unlawful and that he had cast his vote to temporarily sustain it only to allow an orderly transition. He would not support a further extension without \u201cclear and specific congressional authorization (via new legislation),\u201d he wrote.",
      "Congress did not act. But after political pressure from Democrats, a surge in the pandemic and new consideration of the legal issues, the administration on Aug. 3 issued the moratorium that was the subject of the new ruling.",
      "The administration\u2019s legal maneuvering might have failed, but it bought some time for tenants threatened with eviction. In unusually candid remarks this month, President Biden said that was part of his calculus in deciding to proceed with the new moratorium, which was set to expire Oct. 3.",
      "Congress declared a moratorium on evictions at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, but it lapsed in July 2020. The C.D.C. then issued a series of its own moratoriums, saying that they were justified by the need to address the pandemic and authorized by a 1944 law. People unable to pay rent, the agency said, should not be forced to crowd in with relatives or seek refuge in homeless shelters, spreading the virus.",
      "The last moratorium \u2014 which was put in place by the C.D.C. in September and expired on July 31 after being extended several times by Congress and Mr. Biden \u2014 was effective at achieving its goal, reducing by about half the number of eviction cases that normally would have been filed since last fall, according to an analysis of filings by the Eviction Lab at Princeton University.",
      "The challengers in the current case \u2014 landlords, real estate companies and trade associations led by the Alabama Association of Realtors \u2014 argued that the moratorium was not authorized by the law the agency relied on, the Public Health Service Act of 1944.",
      "That law, the challengers wrote, was concerned with quarantines and inspections to stop the spread of disease and did not bestow on the agency \u201cthe unqualified power to take any measure imaginable to stop the spread of communicable disease \u2014 whether eviction moratoria, worship limits, nationwide lockdowns, school closures or vaccine mandates.\u201d",
      "The C.D.C. responded that the moratorium was authorized by the 1944 law. Evictions would accelerate the spread of the coronavirus, the agency said, by forcing people \u201cto move, often into close quarters in new shared housing settings with friends or family, or congregate settings such as homeless shelters.\u201d",
      "The moratorium, the administration told the justices, was broadly similar to quarantine. \u201cIt would be strange to hold that the government may combat infection by prohibiting the tenant from leaving his home,\u201d its brief said, \u201cbut not by prohibiting the landlord from throwing him out.\u201d",
      "The case was complicated by congressional action in December, when lawmakers briefly extended the C.D.C.\u2019s moratorium through the end of January in an appropriations measure. When Congress took no further action, the agency again imposed moratoriums under the 1944 law.",
      "In its Supreme Court brief, the government argued that it was significant that Congress had embraced the agency\u2019s action, if only briefly.",
      "The central legal question in the case was whether the agency was entitled to act on its own. In June, with the earlier moratorium about to expire, the court voted 5 to 4 in favor of the administration, allowing that measure to stand.",
      "But that victory was distinctly provisional. Justice Kavanaugh, who voted with the majority, wrote that he had cast his vote reluctantly and had taken account of the then-impending expiration of the earlier moratorium.",
      "\u201cThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention exceeded its existing statutory authority by issuing a nationwide eviction moratorium,\u201d Justice Kavanaugh wrote. \u201cBecause the C.D.C. plans to end the moratorium in only a few weeks, on July 31, and because those few weeks will allow for additional and more orderly distribution of the congressionally appropriated rental assistance funds, I vote at this time to deny the application\u201d that had been filed by the challengers.",
      "The other members of the court did not give reasons for their votes in the June ruling. But four of them \u2014 Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett \u2014 voted to lift the earlier moratorium. Taken together with Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s statement, that distinctly suggested that a majority of the justices would not look favorably on another extension unless it came from Congress.",
      "The Biden administration initially seemed to share that understanding, urging Congress to act and saying it did not have the unilateral power to impose a further moratorium through executive action. When Congress failed to enact legislation addressing the issue, the moratorium expired.",
      "Under pressure from Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats and wary of the rise of the Delta variant, the administration reversed course a few days later.",
      "The new moratorium was not identical to the earlier one, which had applied nationwide. It was instead tailored to counties where Covid-19 was strongest, a category that currently covers some 90 percent of counties in the United States.",
      "Mr. Biden was frank in discussing his reasoning, saying the new measure faced long odds but would buy tenants some time.",
      "\u201cThe bulk of the constitutional scholarship says that it\u2019s not likely to pass constitutional muster,\u201d he said on Aug. 3. \u201cBut there are several key scholars who think that it may \u2014 and it\u2019s worth the effort.\u201d",
      "Many states and localities, including New York and California, have extended their own moratoriums, providing another layer of protection for some renters. In some places, judges, aware of the potential for large numbers of people to be put out on the street even as the pandemic intensifies again, have said they would slow-walk cases and make greater use of eviction diversion programs."

      "Yet as the country debates how far to go with new mandates, the lines between what is safe and what is not are becoming less clear. While she said she was ruling nothing out, Ms. Brown has not imposed the kind of restrictions that were in place when the virus was less virulent than it is now; she has not prohibited indoor dining or large public gatherings, and the state is resuming in-person instruction at most public schools, unless they face serious outbreaks.",
      "That has largely left local leaders and businesses \u2014 and individuals themselves \u2014 to figure out how to navigate the hazardous new terrain.",
      "In the state\u2019s largest city, Portland\u2019s mayor, Ted Wheeler, was among those to embrace new mandates on face coverings this month when Ms. Brown required them for indoor activities, including for those who are vaccinated. \u201cPlease join me in making a commitment to protect those around us by wearing a mask at all times while indoors,\u201d Mr. Wheeler urged on Twitter.",
      "But, a week later, on Aug. 20, Mr. Wheeler gathered with others in the eighth-floor lounge of a downtown hotel, joining a send-off party for a departing staff member. Photos obtained by The New York Times show him sitting with about a dozen people \u2014 almost all unmasked \u2014 testing the limits of the strict new mask rules.",
      "Lennox Wiseley, a spokeswoman for Mr. Wheeler, said the mayor and his staff were complying with the rules because they were \u201cactively eating and/or drinking\u201d \u2014 the state standard at which people can remove their masks indoors.",
      "Guests at the Nines hotel, where the gathering took place, usually wear face coverings but can take them off in the lounge to eat or drink, said Bernard Philippe, general manager of food and beverage. But he acknowledged that it could be a challenge for staff members to gauge precisely when masks should be worn.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard for the server to make any of those distinctions,\u201d Mr. Philippe said.",
      "Ken Stedman, a biology professor at Portland State University who studies viruses, said that while Mr. Wheeler\u2019s group seemed to be spaced apart, he had some concern about the gathering.",
      "\u201cI would prefer to see more masks on,\u201d Dr. Stedman said.",
      "Ken Henson, who co-owns Pelican Brewing, which has locations along the Oregon coast, said the strictest interpretation of the rules was that people should wear masks and pull them down only to take a bite of food or a sip of a drink. But, in practice, he said, his restaurants allow customers to remove their masks once their food or drinks are in front of them.",
      "Even among people who have been generally compliant, he said, some customers are growing wary and unwilling to stay on board.",
      "\u201cThe underlying tension is people are just tired,\u201d Mr. Henson said.",
      "Some places have resisted Ms. Brown\u2019s orders. Redmond\u2019s school board, upset about the statewide requirement that teachers be vaccinated and students wear masks, adopted a resolution on Wednesday night calling for local control over such issues.",
      "Other localities, however, have talked about going even further than the governor. In Washington County, just outside Portland, commissioners considered a ban on indoor dining. Kathryn Harrington, the chair of the county board of commissioners, said the board eventually elected not to impose such a ban after getting advice that it would have little effect unless other counties joined in. Instead, the county elected to step up enforcement of mask requirements.",
      "Ms. Harrington said she personally did not plan to attend events for the foreseeable future.",
      "\u201cI am just not going to be taking any risks with anybody else\u2019s health,\u201d Ms. Harrington said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to not see my friends right now. Really hard. But it\u2019s the right thing to do to limit our gatherings with one another.\u201d",
      "Until the latest surge, Oregon had endured much of the pandemic as a success story. Among states, it ranks 46th in coronavirus deaths per capita.",
      "Throughout much of last year, Ms. Brown maintained some of the most stringent restrictions in the nation and eased them later than many other states did.",
      "But although many Oregonians embraced vaccines, those who live in the more populated parts of the state were more inclined to get one. In some counties, only about one-third of residents are vaccinated, creating fertile territory for the spread of the Delta variant. By July, case numbers in the state started to rise dramatically.",
      "Oregon is now recording more cases each day than at any point in the pandemic, and hospitalizations, now averaging 968 a day, have reached a new peak.",
      "Health care workers in Portland pleaded for action at a news conference this week. Levi Cole, an I.C.U. nurse at Portland Providence Medical Center, said he had measured the ages of some of the people he has recently put into body bags: 20, 37, 42, 45, 52.",
      "\u201cThe enemy has gotten meaner, and society as a whole sort of let its guard down,\u201d Mr. Cole said. \u201cWe are all pretty overwhelmed and pretty exhausted and are running out of the available will and faith in society to do its part.\u201d",
      "Ms. Brown, in the interview, said part of the challenge in states such as Oregon that largely contained the virus early in the pandemic was little natural immunity in the population, allowing the more contagious variant of the virus to run rampant.",
      "The Delta variant began sweeping across the country just after Ms. Brown eased the last remaining restrictions at the end of June. Dr. Renee Edwards, the chief medical officer at Oregon Health & Science University, said the timing of the variant\u2019s arrival was unfortunate. To prevent the crisis the state is now in, she said, the state would have had to return to serious restrictions at least two weeks ago.",
      "New mandates may not help much now, she said, and projections show that cases are likely to reach a peak sometime next week, with or without them.",
      "To help curtail the virus, she said, it is important for people to consider voluntarily restricting activities such as going to restaurants and attending concerts, especially if they are unvaccinated.",
      "\u201cIt is hard to get people back into a mandate mind-set again when they were feeling the freedom of summer,\u201d Dr. Edwards acknowledged.",
      "Ms. Brown said the most draconian restrictions of last year \u2014 such as closed restaurants and limited gatherings \u2014 were unlikely to be as necessary this time around since there were easy and effective tools available: masks and vaccinations.",
      "\u201cIf we continue to mask up and get vaccinated,\u201d she said, \u201cwe know that these tools will save lives and keep our schools, businesses and communities open.\u201d"

    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The select committee scrutinizing the Jan. 6 Capitol riot demanded detailed records on Wednesday about Donald J. Trump\u2019s every movement and meeting on the day of the assault, in a series of requests to federal agencies that suggested it was focusing on any ties the former president may have had to the attack\u2019s planning or execution.",
      "The committee\u2019s demands, sent to the National Archives and Records Administration and six other agencies, show that as they ramp up their inquiry, investigators are looking closely at efforts by the former president to overturn the results of the 2020 election and any connections he or his administration had to the rioters.",
      "They are also looking into the potential involvement of at least one top aide to a Republican member of Congress who helped publicize the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rallies, which drew Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters to Washington on Jan. 6 to protest the election outcome.",
      "The panel sought communications among top Trump administration officials about attempts to place politically loyal personnel in senior positions as Mr. Trump sought to invalidate President Biden\u2019s victory in the run-up to the attack. Investigators are also focused on the planning, organization and funding of pro-Trump rallies on Jan. 5 and Jan. 6 and other attempts to stop or slow the process of Mr. Trump handing over the presidency to Mr. Biden.",
      "\u201cOur Constitution provides for a peaceful transfer of power, and this investigation seeks to evaluate threats to that process, identify lessons learned and recommend laws, policies, procedures, rules or regulations necessary to protect our Republic in the future,\u201d Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi and the chairman of the committee, wrote in the letters.",
      "The committee asked the National Archives, which keeps presidential records, for material it has about any plans hatched from within the White House or other federal agencies to derail the Electoral College vote count by Congress. The process was halted for hours on Jan. 6 as a mob of rioters breached the Capitol, hunting for lawmakers and Vice President Mike Pence and brutalizing police officers in the name of Mr. Trump.",
      "From the Defense Department and the Justice Department, the committee asked for records of discussions about potentially invoking the Insurrection Act, which some feared Mr. Trump might use to deploy the military to cling to power; communications between government entities during the Capitol violence; and exchanges between the Justice Department and Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign legal team about challenges to the election\u2019s outcome.",
      "The committee called on the Department of Homeland Security and the F.B.I. to furnish records of intelligence gathered before the assault; documents about the Secret Service\u2019s protection of Mr. Pence and his family as the mob threatened him; and records tracking the spread and source of online disinformation about the election.",
      "The panel also sought information from the Interior Department about permitting for the rallies that preceded the mob violence and communications with the U.S. Park Police as the attack escalated. And it requested information from the National Counterterrorism Center about briefing materials prepared for senior officials before Jan. 6.",
      "The letters kicked off what is expected to be a flurry of records demands the committee plans to issue this week.",
      "Mr. Thompson told reporters that the committee planned to ask social media and telecommunications companies to preserve records of potentially \u201cseveral hundred people,\u201d including several unidentified members of Congress, as it scrutinizes those who worked to inflame the mob and were in communication with groups seeking to overturn the election.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll look at everything that will give us information on what happened on Jan. 6,\u201d Mr. Thompson said on Capitol Hill this week. \u201cWe have quite an exhaustive list of people.\u201d",
      "The expansion of the select committee\u2019s investigation came after a hearing in July in which four police officers told in excruciating detail of the brutal violence, racism and hostility they suffered as a throng of angry rioters beat, crushed and shocked them on Jan. 6.",
      "After that hearing, Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, one of two Republicans on the panel, pledged to move quickly to uncover any potential ties between the rioters and the Trump administration and campaign.",
      "Lawmakers must learn \u201cwhat happened every minute of that day in the White House: every phone call, every conversation, every meeting leading up to, during and after the attack,\u201d Ms. Cheney said then.",
      "Among the documents sought on Wednesday were \u201call calendars, schedules and movement logs regarding meetings or events attended by President Trump, including the identity of any individuals in attendance, whether virtual or in-person, on Jan. 6, 2021.\u201d",
      "The committee asked for any documents and communications between the White House and some of Mr. Trump\u2019s allies most involved in trying to undermine the election, including Stephen K. Bannon, his former chief strategist; Michael T. Flynn, his former national security adviser; Rudolph W. Giuliani, who served as his lawyer; and his longtime associate Roger J. Stone Jr.",
      "The committee is also seeking White House communications with Mike Lindell, the MyPillow chief executive and confidant of Mr. Trump, and the lawyer Sidney Powell, both of whom pushed lies and conspiracy theories about widespread election fraud. And it demanded records of communications between the White House and Ali Alexander, who publicized the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rallies, as well as Tom Van Flein, the chief of staff to Representative Paul Gosar, the Arizona Republican who helped promote them and tried to invalidate electoral votes for Mr. Biden on Jan. 6.",
      "It also asked for records on extremist groups and militias that were present at the Capitol that day, including QAnon, the Proud Boys, Stop the Steal, the Oath Keepers and the Three Percenters.",
      "The requests indicated the committee planned to investigate Mr. Trump\u2019s pressure campaign on state officials to overturn the results of the election. Among the information sought were records from Republican state officials including Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona, Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia and Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state.",
      "A records demand is often the first step a congressional committee takes before issuing subpoenas to obtain documents.",
      "The investigative push came as Michael A. Bolton, the Capitol Police inspector general, is continuing his own internal investigation into security failures on Jan. 6.",
      "In his latest report, a summary of which was obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Bolton faulted the agency\u2019s communications during the attack, when officers say their urgent pleas for help went unanswered.",
      "The report, based on interviews with 36 Capitol Police officers, criticized what the inspector general called \u201cdepartmentwide command and control deficiencies related to information sharing, chain of command directions, communication, preparedness, training, leadership development, emergency response procedures and law enforcement coordination.\u201d",
      "In response, the Capitol Police said in a statement that the agency had \u201cacknowledged there were communication gaps on Jan. 6.\u201d",
      "\u201cGiven the events of Jan. 6, the enormous amount of radio traffic that day was not surprising,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAdditionally, the size and magnitude of Jan. 6 made it difficult to respond to each officer\u2019s emergency radio broadcast in real time.\u201d",
      "The department said it had enlisted a retired Secret Service agent to help oversee a new operational planning process."

      "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Although he is mired in a political crisis about the withdrawal from Afghanistan, President Biden still plans to campaign for Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is facing a recall election in California, Mr. Biden\u2019s press secretary said on Wednesday.",
      "The president had previously indicated he would try to help Mr. Newsom retain his job. But some political activists had wondered whether Mr. Biden would back out of the trip because of the turmoil in Afghanistan.",
      "Jen Psaki, the press secretary, said Mr. Biden still planned to go to California. \u201cI don\u2019t have a date for you at this point in time,\u201d she said, \u201cbut that is still certainly his plan.\u201d",
      "Mr. Newsom, the Democratic governor of the nation\u2019s most populous state, is fending off an effort to remove him from office that began as a long shot initiated by Republicans dissatisfied with his policies on immigration and the death penalty. But as the coronavirus pandemic wore on and frustration built over prolonged restrictions, the recall gathered steam and, thanks in part to an extended deadline, enough signatures to trigger an election.",
      "Now Mr. Newsom and his allies are working to get the attention of the state\u2019s enormous Democratic base, hoping to counteract enthusiasm for his ouster among Republicans.",
      "All of the state\u2019s some 22 million registered voters were set to receive ballots by mail. On those ballots, they will be asked whether they think Mr. Newsom should be recalled, and if so by whom. The leading candidate to replace Mr. Newsom is Larry Elder, a conservative radio host from Los Angeles who some Democrats have described as an agent of a far-right power grab.",
      "Mr. Biden has already voiced support for Mr. Newsom. The president said on Twitter that the governor was \u201cleading California through unprecedented crises \u2014 he\u2019s a key partner in fighting the pandemic and helping build our economy back better.\u201d",

    "title": "How Government Decisions Left Tennessee Exposed to Deadly Flooding",
    "content": [
      "The floods that killed at least 20 people in Tennessee last weekend arrived with shocking speed and force \u2014 seemingly a case study of the difficulties of protecting people from explosive rainstorms as climate change gets worse.",
      "A closer look at what happened in the days, years and even decades before the storm reveals that a series of government decisions \u2014 where and how to build, when to update flood maps, whether to join the federal flood insurance program and how to warn of dangerous floods \u2014 left residents more exposed to flooding than they had to be.",
      "Record rainfall, at times exceeding three inches an hour, swelled rivers and creeks in Middle Tennessee on Saturday, destroying homes, cutting off power and cellphone service and washing away bridges. Among the dead are 7-month old twins, a 15-year-old girl and an Army veteran who died after helping his wife and daughter escape.",
      "It\u2019s impossible to say whether any single action could have prevented those deaths, especially given the ferocity of the flooding. But interviews with climate and disaster experts and a review of state and federal data show how governments have been slow to adapt to growing threats and failed to take steps that, together, could have lessened the damage.",
      "\u201cThese extreme weather events will become more intense and more frequent,\u201d said Hiba Baroud, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Vanderbilt University in Nashville who specializes in resilience. \u201cWe need to be more proactive, and think about ways to prevent or at least mitigate the impact of these events.\u201d",
      "The story of the disaster in Humphreys County, the hardest-hit area in the state, arguably begins in the late 1970s, when the federal government began offering communities around the country a deal: If they agreed to take basic precautions to limit the damage from flooding, the government would let people in those communities buy publicly subsidized flood insurance.",
      "Most cities and counties said yes. But not all of them. Humphreys County declined to take part, federal records show. So did neighboring Houston County, which was hit as well over the weekend. (Some cities within those counties, such as Waverly, which was hit hardest by the floods, do take part in the program.)",
      "A spokeswoman for Humphreys County said officials there were unavailable to comment. But in general, communities that decide to stay out of the flood insurance program typically do so because of an aversion to building restrictions, according to Roy Wright, who ran the program until 2018.",
      "Not participating in the flood insurance program hurts communities in a number of ways, according to Chad Berginnis, executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers. It means people can\u2019t buy flood insurance, making it harder to rebuild after a flood. And it prevents people from getting some types of disaster assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.",
      "As officials in Humphreys County spurned the federal government\u2019s offer of flood insurance, they were shaping the future of the county in another way: by declining to adopt residential building codes.",
      "Those codes govern the way houses must be built, to make them more likely to withstand natural disasters and other dangers. For example, Nashville, where catastrophic flooding in 2010 displaced thousands of people, requires the ground floor of new houses be constructed at least four feet above the expected height of a major flood, one of the toughest requirements in the country.",
      "But Humphreys County, despite being only 70 miles west of Nashville and subject to a similar threat from flash floods, has no building code, according to state data. Nor does Houston County, along with some three dozen other counties in Tennessee. (As with flood insurance, some cities within those counties have their own codes.)",
      "That difference is possible because of a decision by Tennessee lawmakers to avoid imposing rules on local governments. While most states adopt a building code and make that code mandatory for all of their cities and counties, Tennessee lets local governments decide whether to follow the state rules, or establish rules of their own, or have none at all.",
      "\u201cAny kind of standard or code is to protect the public,\u201d said Norma Jean Mattei, a former president of the American Society of Civil Engineers and a professor at the University of New Orleans. \u201cIt really is all about public safety.\u201d",
      "In Houston County, Mayor James Bridges said he\u2019d like to have a building code. But he said there wasn\u2019t enough tax revenue to pay for the staff to manage and enforce those rules.",
      "\u201cWith 8,000 people and a very small tax base, we just don\u2019t have the money to have all these different departments that they have in larger cities,\u201d Mr. Bridges said. \u201cWe have so many other needs.\u201d",
      "As homes were being constructed in Humphreys County without a building code, the county\u2019s ability to prepare for flooding was also being affected by a decision in Washington.",
      "FEMA produces maps showing which areas are at risk from flooding, so that homeowners, builders and local officials can make informed decisions about where and how to build houses. Federal law requires the agency to review its flood maps at least once every five years and update them if needed.",
      "But the map for Humphreys County hasn\u2019t been updated since 2009, according to FEMA data. Hickman County, which is southeast of Humphreys and was also flooded, hasn\u2019t had its map updated since 2008.",
      "In addition to the maps\u2019 being out of date, the methodology used by those FEMA maps underestimated the extent of the flood risk facing the region, according to calculations by the First Street Foundation, a group of academics and experts who issued their own estimates last year, which Realtor.com uses to inform home buyers about flood risks.",
      "FEMA\u2019s flood maps show that just 781 properties in Humphreys County are at risk from a so-called 100-year flood, 6.2 percent of all properties. First Street estimates the number is more than three times as high.",
      "In other counties affected by the flooding last weekend, the discrepancy is even greater. The number of properties threatened by flooding in Hickman County, based on First Street\u2019s data, is five times as high as what FEMA\u2019s maps show. In Dickson County, the number is 10 times as high.",
      "That difference reflects the fact that FEMA\u2019s maps look at the flood threat from main river channels but don\u2019t address the risks from smaller creeks and tributaries, according to Jeremy Porter, a professor at the City University of New York and head of research and development for First Street. \u201cAll of the smaller tributaries and streams that were overwhelmed with precipitation runoff are currently unmapped in this area,\u201d Dr. Porter said.",
      "A spokeswoman for FEMA, Jaclyn Rothenberg, said the agency prioritized which areas to update first, and the onus was on local officials to seek new maps. Humphreys County and Hickman County \u201chave not made requests for map updates,\u201d she said. Ms. Rothenberg said the contrasting flood maps developed by FEMA and First Street were \u201cdifferent tools for different intended uses.\u201d",
      "By the afternoon of Friday, Aug. 20, as weather forecasters in central Tennessee began to predict intensifying rain overnight in Humphreys County \u2014 which has no building codes, no flood insurance and outdated flood maps \u2014 there was one big decision left: when and how to warn people.",
      "At 4:55 p.m., the National Weather Service\u2019s Nashville office asked local TV and radio stations to warn people that, in addition to the heavy rainfall of the previous few days, that night could bring an additional 2 to 4 inches.",
      "\u201cHigher amounts may be possible,\u201d the message said. \u201cBe prepared to take action should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.\u201d It did not say what action people should be prepared to take.",
      "At 6:09 a.m. the next morning, the Weather Service began sending warnings directly to cellphones. \u201cA FLASH FLOOD WARNING is in effect for this area,\u201d that message said. \u201cDo not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order.\u201d",
      "But by the time those first messages started hitting people\u2019s phones, there was little time to react. \u201cThey received the notification on their phone at about the same time the water was at their door,\u201d said Dale Popp, the emergency management director for Houston County.",
      "The warnings from the National Weather Service should have gone out before the flooding started, according to Sarah Tuneberg, an emergency manager who started a company called Geospiza that helps local governments protect people during disasters. And she said those warnings should have given people specific instructions on whether to leave their homes.",
      "Krissy Hurley, the warning coordination meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Nashville, said her office decided to alert people to avoid travel once it got reports of roads flooding. She said the agency was wary of sending alerts too early.",
      "\u201cIf you did that before it starts raining, people are going to get really annoyed at you,\u201d Ms. Hurley said.",
      "And her office doesn\u2019t have the authority to customize the phrasing in those alerts, Ms. Hurley said, which she said were standard messages agreed to by the National Weather Service and FEMA.",
      "In Waverly, Linda Ragsdale saw the warnings. But, as she recalled them, the alerts were vague and generic, cautioning that there could be flooding in Middle Tennessee.",
      "She had no inkling that she would wind up crawling into her attic with her dog, her medication and her cellphone, waiting for hours while she could hear wood in her house groan and snap.",
      "Her son called her early Saturday morning, asking if she had gotten any water. \u201cYou could see puddles in people\u2019s yards,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d",
      "Around 8:30 a.m., she got up and looked again. The surge was filling her yard. The water, she said, was \u201cswift and quick, and I didn\u2019t have time to get to my car.\u201d",
      "Several feet of water rushed through her home. It was gutted. She lost her car as well. She said she did not have flood insurance, nor did anyone else on her street.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what I could have done,\u201d Ms. Ragsdale added. \u201cIt just happened so quick. It was too quick.\u201d"

      "In late summer 1955, Mamie Till chose to lay the body of her only child, Emmett, in an open coffin, believing that \u201cthe whole nation had to bear witness to this\u201d \u2014 this Black child of Chicago who had been murdered and mutilated by white men in Mississippi.",
      "\u201cThey had to see what I had seen,\u201d she wrote in her memoir.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of mourners lined up to witness for themselves the horror wrought on the 14-year-old victim, and many, many more saw it when photographs of his body were published in Jet magazine.",
      "From that moment until today, Emmett Till has shaped the civil rights movement in America. Here is a look at who he was, the outrage at his murder and the acquittal of his killers, and his enduring legacy.",
      "Emmett Louis Till was born on July 25, 1941, in Chicago. While Emmett, who was nicknamed Bobo, was an only child, he lived with his mother, grandparents and cousins in a middle-class Black neighborhood on the South Side. A younger cousin, Ollie Gordon, said Emmett \u201cwas a jokester\u201d and \u201cloved to make people laugh.\u201d",
      "As a child he contracted polio, which led to a speech impediment. His mother taught him how to whistle, to help him overcome his stutter.",
      "Emmett\u2019s mother was a 2-year-old in 1924 when she and her family moved from Mississippi to the Chicago area as part of the Great Migration.",
      "Emmett never knew his father, Louis Till, who joined the Army and was accused of raping two women and killing another in Italy in World War II. He was executed in 1945 at age 23, and his military record was leaked before the trial of Emmett\u2019s killers.",
      "In late August 1955, Emmett left his home to visit relatives in the Mississippi Delta.",
      "On the evening of Aug. 24, after picking cotton with his cousins, Emmett went to a store in Money, Miss., that was run by a white couple in their 20s, Roy and Carolyn Bryant. When Emmett went inside to buy bubble gum, Ms. Bryant was working alone.",
      "Emmett\u2019s cousin Simeon Wright, 13, and Ruthie Mae Crawford, another Black teenager, said Emmett passed the money for the bubble gum into Ms. Bryant\u2019s hand, instead of leaving it on the counter, as white Mississippians generally expected African Americans to do. Ms. Bryant stormed out to get a pistol from her car, she later testified. Simeon said that Emmett then whistled at Ms. Bryant, and that their group became afraid and left quickly.",
      "Four days later, Mr. Bryant and his half brother, J.W. Milam, both Army veterans, abducted Emmett at gunpoint from the Wright family home. The men took him to a barn about a 45-minute drive away and tortured him.",
      "The men shot Emmett in the head, tied a 75-pound cotton-gin fan to his neck with barbed wire, and tossed his body into the Tallahatchie River. His mutilated corpse was fished out of the water on Aug. 31.",
      "The remains could be identified only by the silver ring on one finger. Emmett had been pistol-whipped; both his wrists were broken; the back of his skull was crushed; other parts of the skull were crumbled; and one eye was gouged out, while the other hung from its optic nerve. The sheriff sought to bury him immediately.",
      "As soon as Mamie Till heard that her son had been kidnapped, she began harnessing the political and cultural power of Black Chicago. A large crowd was on hand when the train carrying Emmett\u2019s body arrived.",
      "\u201cYou didn\u2019t die for nothing,\u201d she said as the body was transferred to a hearse.",
      "The Chicago Defender estimated that 250,000 people attended during the four days of public viewings.",
      "The close-up photographs of Emmett\u2019s face and body, and the television coverage of his funeral, turned a local murder into a global symbol of American injustice.",
      "A few weeks after Emmett\u2019s funeral, Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a segregated bus in Alabama, saying that she found herself unable to move because she was thinking about Emmett.",
      "Emmett\u2019s mother became a teacher and a civil rights activist. \u201cShe cried from the day of Emmett\u2019s murder to the day she died,\u201d Ms. Gordon said.",
      "Emmett and his mother, who died in 2003, are buried in Burr Oak Cemetery in Alsip, Ill., a Chicago suburb.",
      "Historians believe that several white men were involved in the torture and murder of Emmett, though only Mr. Bryant and Mr. Milam were put on trial. The defense\u2019s argument, by the end, was that Emmett was still alive and hiding out in Chicago or elsewhere, and that the N.A.A.C.P. had put a different body in the river.",
      "Each Black witness for the prosecution, including Emmett\u2019s mother, took great risks to testify. Two Black witnesses were jailed in another county to keep them from appearing at the trial.",
      "Ms. Bryant testified that Emmett accosted her and made crude remarks (claims that she would recant more than 50 years later). After five days and an hour of jury deliberation, the two men were acquitted by an all-white, all-male jury; the acquittal meant they could not be retried, even after they later admitted in a Look magazine interview that they had committed the murder. After the trial, a grand jury chose not to indict them on kidnapping charges, even though they had initially told the authorities that they kidnapped and released Emmett.",
      "Tallahatchie County issued a formal apology in 2007 for the 1955 acquittals. \u201cThe Emmett Till case was a terrible miscarriage of justice,\u201d it said in part. \u201cWe state candidly and with deep regret the failure to effectively pursue justice.\u201d",
      "The Black Americans who grew up in the 1950s organized nearly all of the mass meetings, sit-ins and marches that accelerated the civil rights movement, calling themselves \u201cthe Emmett Till generation.\u201d",
      "\u201cI realized that this could just as easily have been a story about me or my brother,\u201d Muhammad Ali said.",
      "Representative John Lewis of Georgia wrote that he had been \u201cshaken to the core\u201d by Emmett\u2019s death. As was Representative Bobby L. Rush of Illinois, who was 9 years old and living in the Deep South at the time of the killing.",
      "\u201cWhen the photograph from Emmett Till\u2019s funeral ran in Jet magazine, I will never forget how my mother gathered us around the living room coffee table, put the magazine in the middle, pointed to it, and said, \u2018This is why I brought my boys up out of Albany, Ga.,\u2019\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThat photograph shaped my consciousness as a Black man in America. The course of my life would not have been the same had I not been exposed, as a child, to the horror of the photograph.\u201d",
      "No. In May 2004, the F.B.I. opened an investigation to see if others were involved, and Emmett\u2019s body was later exhumed for an autopsy, which had not previously been performed. In 2007, a state grand jury in Mississippi declined to indict anyone else.",
      "Mr. Bryant, who spent time in prison for food stamp fraud, died in 1994. Mr. Milam also spent time in jail, for using a stolen credit card and, in a separate case, for assault and battery. He died in 1980.",
      "The local authorities initially issued a warrant for Ms. Bryant\u2019s arrest on kidnapping charges, but it was never served. A grand jury in Greenwood, Miss., declined to indict her in 2007.",
      "The Justice Department announced in December 2021 that it had closed an investigation into Ms. Bryant, who was quoted in a 2017 book, \u201cThe Blood of Emmett Till,\u201d as saying that she had lied when she claimed that Emmett had physically accosted her and had made sexual advances.",
      "The author, who told The New York Times he had \u201cdocumented her words carefully,\u201d provided one recording to the F.B.I. that did not include a recantation, officials said. The department said it could not pursue perjury charges without corroborating the book\u2019s claim; Ms. Bryant\u2019s daughter-in-law said she never changed her story.",
      "Ms. Bryant, more recently known as Carolyn Bryant Donham, died at 88 on Tuesday. Her death was confirmed on Thursday by Megan LeBoeuf, the chief investigator for the Calcasieu Parish coroner\u2019s office in Louisiana.",
      "Some of his relatives are trying to keep pressure on law enforcement officials to charge Ms. Bryant. \u201cWe hope that they\u2019re not waiting for her to pass on,\u201d said Emmett\u2019s cousin Deborah Watts, who leads the Emmett Till Legacy Foundation, which supports other families whose civil rights have been violated.",
      "Another cousin, the Rev. Wheeler Parker, the only remaining witness to the kidnapping, is helping lead an effort to preserve related sites in Chicago and Mississippi, like the church that held Emmett\u2019s funeral, the barn where he was tortured and the courthouse, so that they might form a national park or monument.",
      "The photographs and TV coverage of Emmett\u2019s body were a precursor to the 1960s\u2019 scenes of officers turning dogs and water cannons on peaceful civil rights demonstrators in Birmingham and Selma, Ala., the police beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles in 1991, and the smartphone video of George Floyd\u2019s murder in Minneapolis in 2020.",
      "Emmett\u2019s name has in some ways become a byword for African American boys and men who are killed by people in positions of authority, such that victims are sometimes referred to as \u201cthe new Emmett Till.\u201d",
      "After learning that there would be no state indictment of the police officer who fatally shot a Black teenager in Ferguson, Mo., in August 2014, a crowd gathered in front of the White House, chanting: \u201cHow many Black kids will you kill? Michael Brown, Emmett Till!\u201d",
      "And Mr. Rush introduced a bill, called the Emmett Till Antilynching Act, that would make lynching a federal hate crime.",
      "\u201cThe metaphorical lynching rope that killed Emmett Till also killed George Floyd and countless others,\u201d Mr. Rush said. \u201cIt extends throughout the history of Black people in America, and it has strangled our nation, preventing America from realizing the promise of its potential.\u201d"

    "content": [
      "Pfizer and BioNTech said on Wednesday they were now applying to the Food and Drug Administration for supplemental approval of a coronavirus vaccine booster shot for those aged 16 and up, and will submit all their supporting data by the end of this week. The move came as the companies said that a third shot of the vaccine sharply increased the levels of antibodies against the virus.",
      "The companies conducted a study of 306 volunteers who received a booster shot about five to eight months after their second shot. Researchers found that the level of antibodies that block the coronavirus jumped more than three times higher than the level after the second dose.",
      "The side effects of a third injection were about the same as after the initial two doses, the companies said. The underlying data was not included in the news release, nor were the dates or location of the study specified. The companies said they were preparing a scientific publication describing the research.",
      "The news of Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s booster application came two days after the F.D.A. fully approved their two-dose vaccine for those 16 and older, making it the first to move beyond emergency use status.",
      "Over the past few weeks, federal regulators have been racing to collect and evaluate data on booster shots. If the F.D.A. decides additional shots are safe and effective, the Biden administration has said it wants adults to get a third injection eight months after their second shot of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, starting the week of Sept. 20.",
      "Federal health officials said last week that they believe that the potency of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines wanes over time, raising the risk of infection from the highly contagious Delta variant. While data indicate that the vaccines continue to offer robust protection against hospitalization and severe disease, the officials said they fear that the situation could change without booster shots.",
      "Some public health experts have challenged the plan as premature, saying the available data shows that the vaccines are holding up well against severe disease and hospitalization, including against the Delta variant. Extra shots would be warranted only if the vaccines failed to meet that standard, some have said.",
      "Pfizer executives presented an early look at their booster data on July 23, during their second-quarter earnings call. In a smaller study, they found that antibody levels dropped markedly in the months following a second dose. But those levels jumped back up after a third dose. When researchers expanded their focus to a larger group of subjects, they continued to find a strong effect from the boosters.",
      "Antibodies that can neutralize the coronavirus are only one kind of defense our immune systems use to fight it. The new study did not include details about other defenses provoked by the vaccine, such as immune cells trained to kill infected cells.",
      "The participants in the new booster study were between the ages of 18 and 55. It was not immediately clear why the study did not include older people. Volunteers were followed for a median period of 2.6 months.",
      "Pfizer and BioNTech said that in addition to the F.D.A., they plan to submit their data to regulatory authorities in Europe and other countries.",
      "The administration\u2019s booster plan does not as yet include recipients of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s one-shot vaccine. Johnson & Johnson announced earlier on Wednesday that unlike the studies of Moderna\u2019s and Pfizer\u2019s vaccines, a study of 17 volunteers showed little change in their antibody levels over the course of six months.",
      "But the study also showed that when the volunteers were given a second shot six months after their first, their antibodies against the coronavirus jumped nine times higher than the level after the first dose. Company officials said they are looking forward to discussing a potential booster strategy for their vaccine with federal health officials.",
      "While Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was fully approved as a two-shot regimen for those 16 and older, adolescents aged 12 to 15 can continue to be vaccinated under the vaccine\u2019s emergency use authorization. Regulators have only authorized a third shot for some people with weakened immune systems."

    "title": "Video Shows Louisiana Trooper Beating a Black Man With a Flashlight",
    "content": [
      "Body-camera footage publicly emerged on Wednesday showing a Louisiana State Police trooper repeatedly clubbing a Black man on the head and chest with a flashlight while the man was pinned to the ground after a traffic stop in 2019, in what the white trooper called \u201cpain compliance.\u201d",
      "The beating left the man, Aaron Larry Bowman, with a broken jaw, three fractured ribs, a broken wrist and a gash to his head that required six staples to close, said a lawyer who is representing him in a civil rights lawsuit filed last year in Louisiana against the State Police.",
      "The trooper, Jacob Brown, 31, of Rayville, La., was arrested in February on charges of aggravated second-degree battery and malfeasance in office in connection with the assault, according to an arrest warrant affidavit.",
      "Mr. Brown, who is facing criminal charges in two unrelated excessive-force cases, resigned one month later.",
      "In the video from the night of May 30, 2019, which was first obtained and published by The Associated Press, Mr. Bowman pleads with law enforcement officers in Monroe, La., that he is cooperating with them. He was struck about 18 times by Mr. Brown with a flashlight as he lay face down on the ground.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not resisting,\u201d Mr. Bowman yells in between the blows. \u201cI\u2019m not resisting.\u201d He was later taken to a hospital.",
      "Mr. Bowman, who is now 46 and lives in Monroe, was charged with resisting a police officer with force or violence, battery of a police officer, flight from an officer and improper lane use.",
      "In an offense report filed with the Ouachita Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office, a deputy said that Mr. Bowman had ignored his lights and sirens as the deputy tried to pull him over after the S.U.V. that Mr. Bowman was driving had crossed the centerline of a road. The deputy said that Mr. Bowman had struck him on the head with a closed fist and had struggled with him after telling officers that he had been afraid to pull over and wanted to park the vehicle at his home in case he went to jail.",
      "The encounter occurred less than three weeks after the death of another Black motorist, Ronald Greene, who body-camera footage showed had been dragged, beaten and shocked with a stun gun by troopers while in custody outside Monroe. The troopers were assigned to Troop F in Monroe, where Mr. Brown was based.",
      "Now the subject of a Justice Department investigation into police brutality and obstruction, the Louisiana State Police attributed the cause of Mr. Greene\u2019s death to a car crash after a high-speed chase and initially made no mention of the use of force by troopers. At least four troopers in Louisiana are facing charges related to excessive force.",
      "A Louisiana State Police spokeswoman said in an email on Wednesday that an investigation had determined that Mr. Brown\u2019s body-camera footage of his encounter with Mr. Bowman had been \u201cintentionally mislabeled.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs the investigation continued, detectives concluded that Brown engaged in excessive and unjustifiable actions and failed to report the use of force to his supervisors,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Lt. Melissa Matey.",
      "A lawyer for Mr. Brown declined to comment on Wednesday.",
      "According to court documents in another one of those cases, Mr. Brown bragged in text messages to several other troopers about using force against a Black man who had led officers on a chase in May 2020 in Franklin Parish, La.",
      "\u201cHe gonna be sore tomorrow for sure,\u201d Mr. Brown wrote. \u201cLMAO \u2026 warms my heart knowing we could educate that young man.\u201d",
      "When investigators asked Mr. Brown about his use of force against Mr. Bowman, he told them that he had used a flashlight as a baton as part of what he called \u201cpain compliance,\u201d according to an affidavit.",
      "A lawyer for the Louisiana Department of Public Safety & Corrections, which includes the State Police, referred questions to the state attorney general\u2019s office, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.",
      "A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Shreveport, La., confirmed in an email on Wednesday that the F.B.I. and the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department were investigating the case.",
      "\u201cIf the investigation reveals prosecutable violations of any federal criminal statutes, the department will take appropriate action,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Vicki T. Chance.",
      "A lawyer who represents Mr. Bowman and Mr. Greene\u2019s family said on Wednesday that Mr. Bowman had first seen the body-camera footage about a month ago and had been traumatized by it. He said that the Louisiana State Police had been forced to turn the recording over to Mr. Bowman\u2019s defense lawyer as he fights the criminal charges against him.",
      "\u201cThis is something that he relives every day,\u201d said the lawyer, Ron Haley. \u201cThe emotional scars will never be healed from this.\u201d",
      "Keith Whiddon, a defense lawyer for Mr. Bowman, said on Wednesday that his client had pleaded not guilty to the four charges against him. Mr. Bowman\u2019s next court appearance is scheduled for Sept. 20.",
      "The A.P. did not say how it had gotten the body-camera footage, which was obtained later on Wednesday by The New York Times. The A.P., citing State Police records, reported that Mr. Brown had been involved in 23 instances that involved use of force, dating to 2015 \u2014 19 of them targeting Black people.",
      "The Louisiana State Police did not immediately make those records available on Wednesday. The agency\u2019s spokeswoman said that it would require a public records request, for which there is an extensive waiting list.",
      "She also did not immediately confirm the number of use-of-force cases involving Mr. Brown, who the television station WBRZ reported last October is the son of Bob Brown, a former assistant superintendent of the Louisiana State Police and its now-retired chief of staff."

      "Any solo international trip of the first female vice president of the United States and the country\u2019s first female vice president of color would, in normal circumstances, invite first-degree scrutiny. Not just of her speeches and joint news conferences, but of her ceremonial appearances. Emphasis on the last word.",
      "After all, as a pioneer and one of the rare women helping to lead a country on the world stage (at a time when one of the most famous, Angela Merkel of Germany, is about to step down), every statement and choice she makes carries with it the symbolism of the trailblazer. Her decisions impact not just herself, but those who come after her and will learn from her example.",
      "And yet Kamala Harris\u2019s recent trip to Southeast Asia, which came to an end on Aug. 26, was notable in part because of how much the focus was on what she said and how little extraneous commentary it generated; how little reaction to the theater of the trip (the costumes! the curtain raisers!). Which is, when you think about the formal choreography of such trips, which are a dance between public performance and private policy negotiations, pretty extraordinary.",
      "The Daily Mail was so desperate for content that it tried to drum up angst because of \u2026 a smile.",
      "That may suggest that we\u2019re so inured to the idea of a female leader that we have ceased to focus on it at all, a theory that falls into the too-good-to-be-true category. (Making snap judgments based on appearance is a basic part of human nature.) Or it suggests that Ms. Harris consciously and strategically crafted her image to ensure that it could not distract from the duty at hand.",
      "Which is not to say she thought about it any less.",
      "Consider: From the evening of Aug. 20, when she left Washington to fly to Singapore, through her time in Vietnam, she wore only dark pantsuits in navy, gray and black, with a small flag pin on the lapel, plain white or light blue shells beneath and her signature simple strand of pearls.",
      "She wore a dark pantsuit to meet with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore. A dark pantsuit to the orchid naming ceremony. A dark pantsuit to meet with President Nguyen Xuan Phuc of Vietnam to pay homage at John McCain\u2019s memorial in Hanoi on the third anniversary of his death.",
      "Against the backdrop of the messy evacuation from Afghanistan and the need to reaffirm America\u2019s commitment to its allies, with the Delta variant and other forms of the virus casting a cloud of fear over the world\u2019s efforts to combat the pandemic, her somber wardrobe served to reflect the somber state of the world.",
      "Her choices also helped her blend in: not just with her male peers, who were similarly attired (at a news conference with Prime Minister Lee, she wore a light blue shell that, coincidentally, matched his light blue shirt), but with political tradition as it exists in the shared imagination. After all, dark suits are essentially a synonym for generic world leader uniform, which is why people freak out when a president makes the rare appearance in beige. (Beige! Oh my god! Oh my god!)",
      "In the end, that was the biggest takeaway from the vice president\u2019s stagecraft. More than the fact that within that framework, Ms. Harris also checked the boxes of diplomatic dress, wearing American designers (Prabal Gurung, Altuzarra) and, in line with her mandate to focus on climate change, only clothes she already owned.",
      "Given that Ms. Harris has pointedly veered away from the bled-into-the-background uniform at past moments in the spotlight \u2014 when she wore a suffragist white suit on the evening Joe Biden declared victory in the presidential election; a bright purple coat and dress, melding blue and red, at her swearing-in; a cream pantsuit at the State of the Union \u2014 it was clearly a tactical choice.",
      "And it was effective from the point of view of a number two who doesn\u2019t want to take the spotlight away from her boss. Or distract from the grim issues of the moment (not to mention demonstrate discipline and an ability to stay resolutely on message). Even if, watching the trip play out, it was hard not to wish that a woman did not have to don generic male camouflage to enact her part.",
      "Clothing can be used to communicate a variety of messages \u2014 unity and hope and allyship and resolution \u2014 and that is a tool that is most available to women, for obvious reasons. They should not have to sacrifice it to be taken seriously. No one should.",
      "Maybe that will come, legitimizing the opportunity for everyone to use dress (and fashion, let\u2019s say it) to its greatest, most multidimensional extent. For now, Ms. Harris has to walk a fine line between representing her administration and making history. It\u2019s possible she can\u2019t serve both masters. But it would be something to see."

    "content": [
      "Jason R. Ravnsborg, the South Dakota attorney general who struck and killed a man while driving home from a Republican Party dinner last year, pleaded no contest on Thursday to two misdemeanor charges he faced in connection with the case, his spokesman said on Thursday.",
      "A plea deal allowed Mr. Ravnsborg to avoid a trial that had been scheduled for Thursday. He was fined $500 for each of the two misdemeanors, plus court fees, and a third misdemeanor charge was dropped, according to the spokesman, Michael Deaver.",
      "Mr. Ravnsborg, a Republican, had been charged with careless driving, using a mobile electronic device while driving, and failing to stay in his lane on the night of the crash, which killed Joseph Boever, a 55-year-old pedestrian, on Sept. 12. The careless-driving charge was dropped.",
      "The case has cast a long shadow over state politics in South Dakota. Officials from both sides of the aisle, including Kristi Noem, the Republican governor, have called on Mr. Ravnsborg to resign.",
      "Mr. Deaver said Wednesday that Mr. Ravnsborg did not intend to step down.",
      "\u201cI ran to be your attorney general because I believe in the law; I believe in fairness, due process and doing what\u2019s right,\u201d Mr. Ravnsborg said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cNow, having experienced the legal system from both sides, I renew my commitment to be transparent and responsive to the needs of the people of South Dakota.\u201d",
      "Ms. Noem said in a statement on Thursday that if Mr. Ravnsborg did not resign, the South Dakota Legislature should consider impeachment, adding that she had ordered the Department of Public Safety to share the case\u2019s investigative file with the speaker of the state House of Representatives.",
      "\u201cLike many South Dakotans, I am not only disappointed in how this process was handled by prosecutors, but outraged at the result of today\u2019s plea hearing and sentencing,\u201d she said. \u201cRavnsborg has not accepted responsibility for the death of Joseph Boever and did not even appear in court today to face the charges or the Boever family. \u201d",
      "According to The Associated Press, Mr. Boever\u2019s family was frustrated that the attorney general did not attend Thursday\u2019s hearing.",
      "\u201cWhy, after having to wait nearly a year, do we not have the chance to face him?\u201d Jane Boever, Mr. Boever\u2019s sister, reportedly said on Thursday, adding that Mr. Ravnsborg had left her brother behind carelessly and that his punishment amounted to a \u201cslap on the wrist.\u201d",
      "After the crash, Mr. Ravnsborg, who took office in January 2019, initially told the authorities that he had hit something that he believed was most likely a deer. Ms. Noem urged people to watch videos released by the state in February, which showed investigators confronting Mr. Ravnsborg.",
      "That month, the governor said in a statement that with charges filed and the investigation over, \u201cI believe the attorney general should resign.\u201d Three police groups, including the South Dakota Sheriffs\u2019 Association, also called on Mr. Ravnsborg to step down, citing a lack of confidence in his ability to serve as the state\u2019s top law enforcement officer. And a bipartisan group of legislators filed a resolution proposing the possibility of impeaching Mr. Ravnsborg, writing that he \u201cmust be removed\u201d from office.",
      "Then, on Feb. 25, a judge issued a gag order requiring state officials to stop releasing evidence and to delete the videos.",
      "On Wednesday, Jamie Smith, a Democrat who had sponsored the impeachment resolution, said that the possibility of any future impeachment efforts would depend on what happened with Mr. Ravnsborg\u2019s case.",
      "\u201cI still don\u2019t think he\u2019s able to do his job effectively, and so we\u2019re going to have to see,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a big cloud hanging over that office.\u201d",
      "In his statement on Thursday, Mr. Ravnsborg said that Mr. Boever\u2019s death \u201cweighs heavily on me and always will.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve often wondered why the accident occurred and all the things that had to have happened to make our lives intersect,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ve wished thousands of times our paths would have crossed under different circumstances.\u201d",
      "Days after the crash, Mr. Ravnsborg said in a statement that he had personally found the body of Mr. Boever the morning after the accident. And in the two videos that were briefly released by the state, Mr. Ravnsborg told the story of what he said had happened on the night of the crash.",
      "In the first video, from Sept. 14, Mr. Ravnsborg told investigators that he had been driving home alone from a Republican Party dinner on the night of Sept. 12 and that after passing through the town of Highmore, he had accelerated to about 67 miles per hour on U.S. Highway 14.",
      "\u201cAnd then, quite frankly, wham,\u201d he said. \u201cI hit, the incident happened. I never saw anything until the impact.\u201d He said he had jumped out of the car and called 911. He then hung up, used his phone\u2019s flashlight and looked around the highway and the ditch.",
      "\u201cI am thinking it is a deer at this point, but I did not see anything,\u201d he told two investigators during the interview, adding that he did not see blood or fur from the impact, just debris from his car.",
      "After the sheriff arrived, he made arrangements for a tow truck and lent Mr. Ravnsborg a vehicle so he could drive home.",
      "The next morning, on his way to return the vehicle, Mr. Ravnsborg and a staff member stopped at the scene of the accident, where Mr. Ravnsborg said he found a body in a ditch. The body was later identified as Mr. Boever, a resident of Highmore.",
      "When told by investigators in the first interview that they had found a broken pair of eyeglasses in his car, Mr. Ravnsborg could not say whether they belonged to him, even though he said he did not wear glasses.",
      "In the second interview, on Sept. 30, Mr. Ravnsborg was told that the eyeglasses belonged to Mr. Boever. \u201cThat means his face came through your windshield,\u201d one of the investigators said.",
      "Mr. Ravnsborg maintained that he had not seen Mr. Boever that night.",
      "Nick Nemec, one of Mr. Boever\u2019s cousins, said the family had been distressed by what they heard in the videos. \u201cIt is even worse than we thought,\u201d Mr. Nemec said in an interview shortly after the videos had been released.",
      "Toxicology results showed no signs that Mr. Ravnsborg had been under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the crash, prosecutors have said. Mr. Boever\u2019s family has questioned why Mr. Ravnsborg was not tested on the night of the collision.",
      "During one of the interviews, Mr. Ravnsborg defended his conduct.",
      "\u201cI believe I did not do anything wrong, and I obviously replayed it in my mind about a thousand times,\u201d he said. \u201cI never saw it \u2014 now him, I have learned \u2014 or anything I hit, and I tried to react appropriately from there.\u201d"

      "",
      "HEALDSBURG \u2014 Take a drive through this picture-perfect wine country town and you\u2019ll start to spot them, unsubtle symbols of our state\u2019s extreme drought.",
      "Peeking out from side yards of cottages and behind fences of grand multimillion-dollar homes are massive four-foot plastic cubes for storing water.",
      "For the approximately 12,000 people who live here, the containers have become a prized commodity. And, for a city struggling with an extremely limited water supply, a solution.",
      "\u201cI definitely think that this is a success story,\u201d Felicia Smith, a Healdsburg official, told me.",
      "Healdsburg is in Sonoma County, one of the first places Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a drought emergency this year due to a dwindling local water supply.",
      "In an attempt to cut overall water usage by 40 percent, Healdsburg officials in June put a cap on each household\u2019s water consumption and banned irrigation of yards.",
      "But officials didn\u2019t want the restrictions to kill trees and shrubs. So the city began offering deliveries of treated wastewater to residents to water their plants, as long as they have a container to store it.",
      "On a dry 95-degree afternoon, Joan Voight walked me along the side of her terra cotta-colored bungalow, where she keeps her plastic water tank. She and her husband bought it on Amazon and installed a pump, she said.",
      "But more important is what the water serves.",
      "\u201cFollow the hose,\u201d Voight said as she led me into her backyard, home to her family\u2019s pandemic project: a thriving vegetable garden.",
      "On the plant stalks, some as tall as us, were glossy cherry tomatoes, globes of deep purple eggplant and sweet Italian peppers. She lifted a drooping stem to reveal a bulbous yellow pumpkin.",
      "\u201cThis garden can\u2019t go a full week without water,\u201d Voight, 67, said.",
      "The city\u2019s water crunch pushed officials to take fuller advantage of ponds on the outskirts of town that store millions of gallons of treated wastewater, Smith said.",
      "Wineries have long used the water \u2014 safe for crops but not drinkable \u2014 but most city residents didn\u2019t know it existed nor did they have equipment to pick it up from the facility, she said.",
      "So starting in late June, the city began delivering up to 500 gallons of recycled water to homes. As of Tuesday, 961 households were enrolled in the program, more than a quarter of the city\u2019s residential water accounts, Smith said.",
      "For now at least, the city is absorbing the roughly $150,000 monthly cost of the deliveries so they remain free for residents, she said.",
      "\u201cYou can imagine we\u2019re in a tough spot in that we\u2019re prohibiting all irrigation,\u201d Smith told me. \u201cThere needed to be an alternative solution.\u201d",
      "The city\u2019s restrictions seem to have worked. Healdsburg\u2019s water usage is down 48 percent compared with the same time last year, beyond the ambitious goal that officials had originally set.",
      "For Voight, who has lived in Healdsburg for 34 years, conserving water is nothing new.",
      "She keeps buckets in the shower to capture water that\u2019s wasted as the tap turns from cold to hot. She saves the water from rinsing dishes and uses a special soap when she does laundry so she can repurpose the suds for her plants.",
      "\u201cWe might as well get used to it,\u201d she told me. \u201cThe drought makes you learn all this water stuff that you never cared about before.\u201d",
      "Over the past 18 months, as the pandemic and devastating wildfires kept Voight home, the backyard garden has been a rare joy, she said.",
      "Not only can she cook delicious stir-fries and curries with the vegetables, but they also serve as currency around town. She likes to swap cherry tomatoes for baked goods and fruit.",
      "And when she is invited over to people\u2019s homes for dinner, she takes an armful of fresh-picked vegetables.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s sort of like if you bring flowers or candies, we bring produce,\u201d she told me.",

    "title": "Coronavirus Briefing: What Happened Today",
    "content": [
      "The U.S. has a far higher share of older adults without full vaccine protection than many other wealthy countries, and it has made the Delta wave deadlier.",
      "Younger, unvaccinated adults are making up an increasing share of new hospital visits, but a vast majority of people dying from Covid-19 are older and unvaccinated. In many counties, especially in the South and the Mountain West, seniors without full vaccination make up more than 10 percent of the total population.",
      "By contrast, unvaccinated seniors in Britain are relatively rare.",
      "Even London, which has higher rates of vaccine hesitancy among older adults than the rest of Britain, is far ahead of most of the U.S. in its vaccination rates.",
      "That discrepancy may help explain why the Delta wave has led to a higher rate of deaths, public health experts say. Although cases surged in both countries, Britain had proportionally fewer hospitalizations and deaths.",
      "Vaccine hesitancy is not unique to the U.S., but it is more widespread and forceful in the country than in Europe, and it breaks down more clearly along political lines. State and local governments have also been less willing than European leaders to use mandates to pressure residents to be vaccinated.",
      "Signing up older Americans for vaccines is a struggle: Those who really wanted a vaccine have already gotten it. Many holdouts are resistant to immunization because of their politics and personal beliefs, or those of their friends and family.",
      "\u201cWe have really tried to get them vaccinated,\u201d said Molly Howell, the immunization director for the North Dakota Department of Health, where health officials have sent letters to every unvaccinated senior in the state. \u201cThere just seems to be a lack of trust in public health and government, and even a lack of trust of medical professionals.\u201d",
      "Sometimes it seems as if scientific understanding of the coronavirus changes by the hour.",
      "The virus was thought to spread only by close contact or on contaminated surfaces, then it turned out to be airborne. Americans don\u2019t need to wear masks. Wait, they do. Booster shots may not be necessary, at least not for a long time \u2014 until they are strongly recommended.",
      "We\u2019re living with science as it unfolds in real time, our colleague Apoorva Mandavilli reported this week. The process has always been fluid and unpredictable. But rarely has it moved at this speed, and rarely has it been so crucial to pay close attention.",
      "For some frustrated Americans, public health officials have seemed at times to be flip-flopping \u2014 or even to be intentionally misleading the country.",
      "Consider mask guidance from the C.D.C. In the early weeks and months of the pandemic, officials said that masks were unnecessary for the general public, in part to preserve supplies for frontline workers, as the Times Opinion columnist Zeynep Tufekci noted. Months later, the agency reversed its advice.",
      "Then, in May 2021, the agency said that vaccinated people could ditch their masks, but did not sufficiently emphasize that masks might be needed again. Now, with a new surge in infections, they are.",
      "One central problem, Apoorva said, is the relatively low level of scientific literacy in the U.S. \u201cWe also don\u2019t really talk about health as a public good, as a community goal,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s not like deciding to exercise or deciding to eat well, which are very individual activities. Infectious disease is, by its definition, something that connects people.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis wouldn\u2019t be happening if public health authorities had done a good job of educating the public from the start,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t really come into a pandemic not ever having talked about these things before and expect people to understand everything and get on board.\u201d",
      "Doctors and researchers have worked with unrelenting speed and focus to fight the pandemic. But they have often fallen short in terms of communicating the shifting landscape to their fellow citizens.",
      "\u201cScientists don\u2019t really understand what people know or don\u2019t know, so they leave out key pieces of information that people need to connect the dots,\u201d Apoorva said. \u201cIn that knowledge gap, somebody else can come in and fill it with a bunch of misinformation.\u201d",
      "See how the vaccine rollout is going in your county and state.",
      "It\u2019s me again, the tired occupational epidemiologist. Sixteen months into this pandemic and I seem to have answered all manner of questions about the virus for my clients. The questions often contain scary words like risk, transmission, mitigation or liability. On reflection, the most meaningful question I\u2019ve gotten during this pandemic, likely the only question that matters, came from a university president, a Jesuit priest responsible for many. He asked me, \u201cShannon, what\u2019s the most loving thing we can do for our community?\u201d The answer to this question has changed throughout the pandemic, but for now, without question, the most loving thing we can do for each other is to get vaccinated. \u2014 Shannon Magari, Syracuse, N.Y.",

      "WAVERLY, Tenn. \u2014 Joseph Prasnikar cannot escape the haunting memory of the last time he saw his wife alive: They were at home, clutched in each other\u2019s arms, as rising water swirled around them. He slipped below the surface. When he climbed back up, she was gone.",
      "The image seared in his mind is vivid and horrifying. He fears it will overpower his memory of the affection and simple comfort that defined the 17 years they had together.",
      "Now, days after powerful floods descended on his Middle Tennessee community, Mr. Prasnikar is putting every ounce of effort into preserving his memories of his wife, Hallie Gerber, and the qualities that make losing her so agonizing: her persistent kindness, her zeal in caring for him as he navigated a litany of health problems. He already misses walking their dogs with her, both of which were also lost in the floods.",
      "\u201cJust that connectedness,\u201d he said, describing their bond, \u201cthat presence for each other that most people don\u2019t know exists.\u201d",
      "Ms. Gerber, 60, was one of 20 people killed last weekend as flash floods tore through communities tucked into the rolling Tennessee woods.",
      "Even though the water has receded, residents remain gripped by excruciating grief, their minds etched with the terror of watching loved ones swept away by torrents that seemed to arrive out of nowhere.",
      "Officials said on Wednesday that all of those missing in the aftermath of the storm have been accounted for. \u201cWe are sad that our count is now at 20,\u201d Grant Gillespie, the police chief in Waverly, said. \u201cOur families now have the closure that they need to move on.\u201d",
      "The dead include 7-month-old twins, Rileigh and Ryan Rigney, who were happiest when they were with each other, and Joe Reeves, a U.S. Army veteran who often stopped to help strangers fix a flat tire and, in his last moments, sacrificed his own well-being to help his wife and one of his daughters escape.",
      "\u201cHe passed away saving their lives,\u201d an older daughter, Rachel Reeves, 29, said. \u201cMy dad was a hero.\u201d",
      "The stories of those who died illustrate what had tied residents to the region but also what will make it so challenging to rebound. In the area\u2019s small communities, nearly everyone was connected to someone who was killed or whose life was otherwise upended.",
      "The collection of small towns connected by two-lane highways winding through woods and farmland is only about 90 minutes west of Nashville, but in some ways it feels farther.",
      "In Waverly, a city of 4,100 that saw some of the worst destruction, modest family homes were clustered together on narrow streets, close enough that neighbors could hold conversations from their front porches. But after the storm sent water surging in from nearby creeks, that proximity only added to residents\u2019 sense of helplessness and grief.",
      "Regenia Lynn Brake, who died after being swept away by the water, lived in a public housing complex of small, spare duplexes in the center of Waverly. She had five children. She wanted to keep them together, and she wanted them to have a home.",
      "Her children described the energy she put into transforming the space into something that was warm and appealing. A few weeks ago, she redecorated her bathroom, inspired by videos of homes designed in the farmhouse style that she liked.",
      "\u201cThese are called the projects, but Mama\u2019s house was not,\u201d said Kayla Brake, Ms. Brake\u2019s oldest daughter. \u201cIt looked like a home in here. They had concrete walls and everybody used to say, \u2018You can\u2019t even hang anything on the walls in there.\u2019\u201d Her mother solved that problem by buying a drill.",
      "At one point, Ms. Brake, 53, worked four jobs \u2014 a paper route and positions at a day care center, a grocery store and FedEx. But she wanted her children to be insulated from whatever struggles she faced, and instead was worried most about their concerns. When Kayla was depressed at 18, she slept in her mother\u2019s bed for months for comfort.",
      "\u201cNo matter how old I was,\u201d her daughter said, \u201cshe let me come in here with her, and I would just be so comfortable, so comfortable just being there with her.\u201d",
      "Donna Gail Bradley, 61, had always feared the water. Her sister, Deanna Hensley, remembered that when they were younger she would never swim alone or venture in too deep.",
      "Ms. Bradley was trapped in the floodwaters that engulfed her home in Waverly. \u201cHer fear in life was drowning,\u201d Ms. Hensley said. \u201cThat\u2019s the hardest thing I\u2019m trying to get past.\u201d",
      "A disabled woman with multiple health issues, Ms. Bradley had been waiting for someone to rescue her. She did not have a car, had trouble breathing and had one arm in a sling because of an injured shoulder, all of which made it difficult for her to flee.",
      "Her body was found on Monday about one mile from her home.",
      "Ms. Bradley, who had three children, was known for her cooking, especially her barbecued venison. \u201cShe had a secret recipe,\u201d Ms. Hensley said. \u201cIt would melt in your mouth.\u201d",
      "Joe Reeves, 58, and his wife, Angela Reeves, had moved to Waverly just two weeks ago. They told people they had found their dream house, with new floors and a spacious porch. \u201cHe was so proud to have got the house for my mom,\u201d his daughter Rachel said.",
      "Born in Paducah, Ky., Mr. Reeves was raised in Missouri and enlisted in the military after high school. He was stationed in Germany when the Berlin Wall fell. He and Angela met at church and married about two decades ago. He bought her Vera Bradley handbags and jewelry. When she was diagnosed with colon cancer this year, he regularly took her to chemotherapy treatments. \u201cThey were so in love,\u201d their daughter said. \u201cHe was so strong for her.\u201d",
      "Mr. Reeves, who had worked at a printing factory, had a passion for coins and fishing largemouth bass. He was a church deacon and sang baritone in a church trio along with his wife.",
      "\u201cGod, family, country \u2014 that\u2019s how you would explain my dad,\u201d Ms. Reeves said.",
      "On a recent afternoon, Mr. Prasnikar, 53, went to the high school that has become a relief hub so he could start the process of rebuilding his life. First, he had to get a new driver\u2019s license.",
      "As he sat in an empty classroom, Mr. Prasnikar said that he and Ms. Gerber were not legally married, but they had assembled some friends and relatives for a small commitment ceremony. He appreciated the rhythms they had developed: He set up the coffee machine at night. She made him a cup of coffee in the morning. When his spirits ebbed, she would help lift them up.",
      "His gratitude for surviving was overshadowed by grief. \u201cI\u2019m bereft,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m broken right now.\u201d",
      "At a funeral home in Nashville on Wednesday afternoon, a single small coffin was surrounded by flowers. Rileigh and Ryan Rigney always wanted to be with each other, so it made sense that the twins would be buried together.",
      "During a service on Wednesday, the family showed photographs of their brief lives: their days in the newborn intensive care unit at the hospital, their arrival at home. In one picture, Ryan \u2014 or Bubba, as his family called him \u2014 gave Rileigh a kiss, which made her smile. \u201cI won\u2019t forget the way she giggled if you kissed just under her cheeks and by her neck,\u201d Danielle Hall, their mother, said.",
      "\u201cEven though it\u2019s killing me that I lost two babies,\u201d she said, \u201cI know that at least they were together.\u201d",
      "The family of Lilly Bryant, 15, had been tormented by uncertainty for days. She had been missing since Saturday when the makeshift wooden raft she and her sister were clinging to hit a tree and split in two, separating them.",
      "Lilly was supposed to be starting her freshman year of high school. She loved to dance and had a nurturing soul, always playing with younger cousins and other children in Waverly, her family said.",
      "Out-of-town relatives, neighbors and even strangers had helped search for the girl. On Wednesday, her body was found.",
      "\u201cLilly has been of great concern to everyone,\u201d Chief Gillespie said. \u201cI\u2019m glad that we could find her and give closure today.\u201d"

    "title": "Michael Avenatti Is Granted Mistrial in Federal Fraud Case",
    "content": [
      "A federal judge in Southern California declared a mistrial on Tuesday in a fraud case against Michael Avenatti, giving the brash former lawyer for Stormy Daniels a rare victory as he fights his conviction and sentence in another criminal case and awaits trial in a third.",
      "The judge, James V. Selna of the U.S. District Court in Santa Ana, Calif., found that federal prosecutors had withheld from Mr. Avenatti\u2019s defense team financial data that they had collected as part of their case accusing him of stealing millions of dollars from five clients and lying repeatedly about his business and income.",
      "Mr. Avenatti had contended that the accounting and tax preparation data from his law firm\u2019s servers was exculpatory evidence that could clear him of the charges.",
      "He asked Judge Selna in an Aug. 15 motion to dismiss the charges or grant him a new trial. The judge set a tentative new trial date for Oct. 12.",
      "\u201cI think today is, obviously, a good day for me personally, but it is also a good day for every individual in this country who is charged with a crime and faces the power and resources of the government,\u201d Mr. Avenatti said in a phone interview on Tuesday. \u201cEvery American citizen deserves basic fundamental due process.\u201d",
      "A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Los Angeles declined to comment on Tuesday, citing the continuing proceedings against Mr. Avenatti.",
      "The website Law.com earlier reported the mistrial, which came as the testimony in the fraud case was entering its sixth week.",
      "\u201cI find that prejudice occurred here in a number of ways,\u201d Judge Selna said on Tuesday, according to Law.com.",
      "Mr. Avenatti, 50, gained widespread attention for representing Ms. Daniels, a pornographic film actress, in her lawsuits against former President Donald J. Trump.",
      "He became ubiquitous on cable news shows and a thorn in Mr. Trump\u2019s side. But Mr. Avenatti\u2019s rise proved meteoric, with the government accusing him of a multitude of crimes in California and New York that could send him to prison for decades.",
      "In July, a federal judge in Manhattan sentenced Mr. Avenatti to two and a half years in prison and three years of supervised release after he was convicted in February 2020 of trying to extort more than $20 million from Nike.",
      "Mr. Avenatti spent several months last year in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Lower Manhattan after a judge sided with prosecutors and ordered that he be held without bail. He was temporarily released from jail in April 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "During the extortion trial, prosecutors said that Mr. Avenatti had threatened to reveal how employees in Nike\u2019s grass-roots basketball division had paid athletes to attend certain colleges unless the company hired him to conduct an internal investigation. His silence also could have been bought, prosecutors said, if Nike paid him $22.5 million to resolve the potential claims of a youth basketball coach whom Mr. Avenatti said he represented.",
      "Mr. Avenatti, who had been scheduled to report to federal prison by Sept. 15, is appealing his conviction and sentencing in the extortion case. It is one of several criminal entanglements facing the publicity-minded lawyer.",
      "In another criminal case in which he awaits trial, Mr. Avenatti has been accused of stealing $300,000 in proceeds from a book written by Ms. Daniels. He has maintained his innocence in that case.",
      "In California, federal prosecutors in the fraud case said that Mr. Avenatti had lied about his business income not just to his clients, but also to an I.R.S. collection agent, creditors, a bankruptcy court and a bankruptcy trustee.",
      "Mr. Avenatti said on Tuesday that the government had suppressed key evidence that would prove his innocence.",
      "\u201cAnd if I can be denied that due process as a well-known white guy, imagine what it looks like for people who are disadvantaged or Black or brown,\u201d he said."

      "Public schools have long stood at the center of civil strife, from the debate over teaching evolution in the 1920s to the push for school desegregation in the 1950s.",
      "Today, the two biggest divides in schools challenge fundamental narratives of what it means to be an American. The debate over mask mandates puts two values into conflict: collective responsibility and personal liberty. And an examination of the country\u2019s history of racism challenges cherished ideas about America\u2019s founding.",

    "content": [
      "For Moira Smith and her mother, July promised a glimmer of normalcy after months of isolation. The two flew from Alaska to Houston and visited family, celebrating the first birthday of their cousin\u2019s granddaughter. Ms. Smith\u2019s mother bought a patterned pink onesie to give as a gift, and they all snapped photos of the baby\u2019s face smeared with chocolate.",
      "Ms. Smith, 46, knew that her cousin\u2019s family was not vaccinated but tried not to dwell on that. She and her mother had both received their Pfizer shots months earlier. In the hotel room one evening, Ms. Smith\u2019s mother made an offhand comment to her relatives: \u201cYou can take your masks off but you have to promise to get vaccinated,\u201d she chided them.",
      "The next morning Ms. Smith and her mother were headed home, on a layover in the Seattle airport, when they got the phone call: Their relative\u2019s baby had come down with a fever and tested positive for Covid-19.",
      "Two days later, Ms. Smith woke up feeling like she had been \u201chit by a Mack truck,\u201d with body aches and a sore throat, and tested positive for the coronavirus. The next week, her mother, who is 76 and has lung cancer, texted her an emoji of a thermometer indicating she, too, had spiked a fever, and she later wound up in the emergency room with Covid.",
      "Ms. Smith and her mother are part of a wave of Americans falling sick with Covid even though they are fully immunized, in what are known as breakthrough infections.",
      "Public health experts continue to believe that breakthrough infections are relatively uncommon, and rarely result in severe illness or hospitalizations. The vaccines available in the United States offer powerful protection from serious Covid illness, hospitalization and death. A recent analysis of state-reported data from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that more than nine in 10 Covid-19 cases that resulted in hospitalization and death occurred among people who were not fully vaccinated.",
      "\u201cWe always anticipated that there would be some breakthrough infections because the vaccines at their very best were 95 percent effective,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, professor of infectious disease at Vanderbilt. \u201cThe vaccines were designed to prevent severe illness, and they\u2019re spectacularly successful at that.\u201d",
      "But as the more transmissible Delta variant becomes dominant in the United States, rising numbers of breakthrough cases are being reported, although most are mild.",
      "\u201cDelta is vastly more contagious, so as it is spreading among the unvaccinated there is spillover into the vaccinated population,\u201d Dr. Schaffner said. \u201cThe unvaccinated are a big highway of transmission. The vaccinated are a little side street.\u201d",
      "Because people infected with the Delta variant have far more of the virus in their nose and upper respiratory tract, the importance of mask-wearing has become paramount. After the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shifted its guidance on masking, recommending that vaccinated people in hot-spot areas resume wearing masks in public indoor spaces, millions of Americans who are fully immunized struggled to adjust their expectations for autumn months that had seemed to offer some semblance of festivity. And a small subset of Americans has already seen their routines upended by breakthrough infections.",
      "Spurred by concerns about breakthrough infections, federal health officials recently recommended that Americans who received the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines receive a third dose in the coming months. This week Johnson & Johnson reported that a booster shot of its vaccine raised levels of antibodies against the coronavirus.",
      "For some, breakthrough infections have felt like mild allergies, coming with symptoms including a cough, sniffles and a scratchy throat. Others have had more severe cases, where they are bedridden with body aches, fevers and chills. And still others have had some of the telltale signs of Covid such as loss of taste and smell, \u201cCovid rash\u201d and brain fog.",
      "\u201cWe were calling it floaty-head syndrome,\u201d said Molly O\u2019Brien-Foelsch, 47, a marketing executive in Pennsylvania who tested positive for Covid after a trip to the British Virgin Islands with her husband last month. \u201cIt felt like there was a huge marshmallow on my head.\u201d",
      "Scientists believe that breakthrough infections rarely result in severe illness, but there have been cases of prolonged hospitalizations. Elaina Cary-Fehr\u2019s father Isaac, a 64-year-old Uber driver in Austin, was transferred to a long-term care facility after being hospitalized with Covid pneumonia in June and later receiving a tracheotomy tube. He was released from the facility this week.",
      "\u201cI believe in the vaccine, I kept holding on to hope that it would work and it did,\u201d Ms. Cary-Fehr said. \u201cBut I hate that this had to happen to my family.\u201d",
      "Dr. Rebecca Hughes, 32, works as an emergency medicine resident in Boston, so she had spent the last year with a simmering sense of anxiety about Covid exposure. She can still recall the fear she felt the first time she treated a coding Covid patient and wondered for hours whether her mask might have slipped and put her at risk. But all year she was kept safe by her protective equipment.",
      "Then, last month, her family took a vacation to visit her grandparents in Utah. It was a trip they had hoped to take last February but postponed as Covid case rates rose. Four days after they landed, Dr. Hughes felt her throat becoming scratchy. She was certain it was allergies but took a Covid test just in case; it came back positive. Shortly afterward her newborn, who was 9 weeks old, started sneezing and tested positive too, along with Dr. Hughes\u2019s three other children, ages 8, 6 and 3.",
      "\u201cIt felt ironic after I spent so long caring for Covid positive patients on every single shift since the pandemic started,\u201d Dr. Hughes said. \u201cMy 8-year-old knows I\u2019ve been seeing people die from this. She looked at me and said, \u2018Am I going to be OK?\u2019\u201d",
      "Although some breakthrough infections like Dr. Hughes\u2019s are difficult to trace to a precise exposure event, other Americans have found their vacation plans intersecting with well-known outbreaks.",
      "Jimmy Yoder, 25, felt no trepidation as he and his boyfriend, both vaccinated, packed their bags to spend a weekend in Provincetown in July. And because their days and nights there were a blur of clubs and dancing, he assumed that the Monday morning fatigue that greeted him back in Brooklyn was just a bad hangover.",
      "\u201cI was feeling a little rundown but attributed it to a weekend of partying,\u201d Mr. Yoder said. \u201cIn the back of my mind I was like, \u2018There is no way I\u2019m going to get Covid, I\u2019m immune.\u2019 \u201d",
      "By Wednesday morning, Mr. Yoder no longer felt so confident. \u201cI felt like I had a really bad flu,\u201d he said, with a high fever and congested sinuses. He and his boyfriend both tested positive that day. Mr. Yoder slept for the next 18 hours, and when he and his boyfriend were both starting to feel better they ordered a celebratory pizza. They realized then that they had both lost their sense of taste and smell.",
      "Mr. Yoder was relieved to find that of all the people he had exposed \u2014 friends who had driven him home from Provincetown, an office full of colleagues \u2014 only one tested positive. \u201cObviously it shows the vaccines are still working a lot,\u201d he added.",
      "As many Americans begin the familiar exercise of questioning and calling off plans, scientists are stressing the continued importance of mask-wearing to reduce transmission and infection.",
      "\u201cIf you get infected and breathe virus out, it will get trapped by your mask,\u201d said Dr. John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell. \u201cThese viruses don\u2019t have pairs of scissors that can cut through masks.\u201d",

      "\u201cYou saw her get onto the plane. She is well, all is fine and looking forward to meetings in Hanoi tomorrow,\u201d Ms. Sanders said when pressed on the cause of the delay. She later added: \u201cThis has nothing to do with the vice president\u2019s health.\u201d",

Members of the press corps traveling with her were already loaded into a motorcade awaiting her departure when they were abruptly sent back to their hotel rooms, before being summoned back to continue the trip.",
      "Upon arriving in Hanoi aboard Air Force Two, Ms. Harris did not respond to a shouted question from a reporter about why she decided to continue on her trip in the wake of the report.",

    "title": "The New Chief Chaplain at Harvard? An Atheist.",
    "content": [
      "The Puritan colonists who settled in New England in the 1630s had a nagging concern about the churches they were building: How would they ensure that the clergymen would be literate? Their answer was Harvard University, a school that was established to educate the ministry and adopted the motto \u201cTruth for Christ and the Church.\u201d It was named after a pastor, John Harvard, and it would be more than 70 years before the school had a president who was not a clergyman.",
      "Nearly four centuries later, Harvard\u2019s organization of chaplains has elected as its next president an atheist named Greg Epstein, who takes on the job this week.",
      "Mr. Epstein, 44, author of the book \u201cGood Without God,\u201d is a seemingly unusual choice for the role. He will coordinate the activities of more than 40 university chaplains, who lead the Christian, Jewish, Hindu, Buddhist and other religious communities on campus. Yet many Harvard students \u2014 some raised in families of faith, others never quite certain how to label their religious identities \u2014 attest to the influence that Mr. Epstein has had on their spiritual lives.",
      "\u201cThere is a rising group of people who no longer identify with any religious tradition but still experience a real need for conversation and support around what it means to be a good human and live an ethical life,\u201d said Mr. Epstein, who was raised in a Jewish household and has been Harvard\u2019s humanist chaplain since 2005, teaching students about the progressive movement that centers people\u2019s relationships with one another instead of with God.",
      "To Mr. Epstein\u2019s fellow campus chaplains, at least, the notion of being led by an atheist is not as counterintuitive as it might sound; his election was unanimous.",
      "\u201cMaybe in a more conservative university climate there might be a question like \u2018What the heck are they doing at Harvard, having a humanist be the president of the chaplains?\u2019\u201d said Margit Hammerstrom, the Christian Science chaplain at Harvard. \u201cBut in this environment it works. Greg is known for wanting to keep lines of communication open between different faiths.\u201d",
      "The dozens of students whom Mr. Epstein mentors have found a source of meaning in the school\u2019s organization of humanists, atheists and agnostics, reflecting a broader trend of young people across the United States who increasingly identify as spiritual but religiously nonaffiliated. That trend might be especially salient at Harvard; a Harvard Crimson survey of the class of 2019 found that those students were two times more likely to identify as atheist or agnostic than 18-year-olds in the general population.",
      "\u201cGreg\u2019s leadership isn\u2019t about theology,\u201d said Charlotte Nickerson, 20, an electrical engineering student. \u201cIt\u2019s about cooperation between people of different faiths and bringing together people who wouldn\u2019t normally consider themselves religious.\u201d",
      "The Harvard chaplains play an outsize role on campus, touching hundreds of students\u2019 lives whether through Mass offered by the Catholic Student Center or Shabbat dinners at Harvard Hillel. Its leader reports directly to the office of the university president.",
      "To Mr. Epstein, becoming the organization\u2019s head, especially as it gains more recognition from the university, comes as affirmation of a yearslong effort, started by his predecessor, to teach a campus with traditional religious roots about humanism.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t look to a god for answers,\u201d Mr. Epstein said. \u201cWe are each other\u2019s answers.\u201d",
      "Mr. Epstein\u2019s work includes hosting dinners for undergraduates where conversation goes deep: Does God exist? What is the meaning of life? He previously ran a congregation of Boston-area humanists and atheists who met in Harvard Square for weekly services that centered on secular sermons. In 2018 he closed that down to focus his time on building campus relationships, including at M.I.T., where he is also a chaplain. Mr. Epstein frequently meets individually with students who are struggling with issues both personal and theological, counseling them on managing anxiety about summer jobs, family feuds, the pressures of social media and the turbulence endemic to college life.",
      "\u201cGreg is irreverent and good at diffusing pressure,\u201d Ms. Nickerson said, recalling a time he joked that if her summer internship got too stressful she could always get fired \u2014 then she would have a good story to share.",
      "Some of the students drawn to Mr. Epstein\u2019s secular community are religious refugees, people raised in observant households who arrive at college seeking spiritual meaning in a less rigid form.",
      "Adelle Goldenberg, 22, grew up in the Hasidic community in Brooklyn, where she recalls being told that she could not attend college. In preschool, when asked what she wanted to be when she grew up, her answer was simple: a bride. It was the only thing she could envision for a girl like herself. When she turned 19, she applied to Harvard in secret and fled the community.",
      "Once at Harvard, she was wary of assuming any religious label, but she still yearned to find people wrestling with issues deeper than academic achievement. She started attending meetings of the humanist group and discovered in Mr. Epstein a form of mentorship that felt almost like having a secular rabbi, she said.",
      "\u201cWhen the pandemic hit I was like, \u2018Greg, do you have time to talk about the meaning of life,\u2019\u201d Ms. Goldenberg recalled. \u201cHe showed me that it\u2019s possible to find community outside a traditional religious context, that you can have the value-add religion has provided for centuries, which is that it\u2019s there when things seem chaotic.\u201d",
      "Ms. Goldenberg reflected anew on how unlikely her path had been when her mother asked to see the university yearbook: \u201cI told her, \u2018I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to like it,\u2019\u201d Ms. Goldenberg said. \u201cIt says I was co-president of the Harvard Humanists, Atheists and Agnostics. And you can see my shoulders.\u201d",
      "Nonreligiosity is on the rise far beyond the confines of Harvard; it is the fastest growing religious preference in the country, according to the Pew Research Center. More than 20 percent of the country identifies as atheist, agnostic or nonreligious \u2014 called the \u201cnones\u201d \u2014 including four in 10 millennials.",
      "The reasons that more young Americans are disaffiliating in the world\u2019s most religious developed country are varied. The Notre Dame sociologist Christian Smith attributes the trend partly to the growing alliance between the Republican Party and the Christian right, a decline of trust in institutions, growing skepticism of religion in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and a shift away from traditional family structures that centered on churchgoing.",
      "Mr. Epstein\u2019s community has tapped into the growing desire for meaning without faith in God. \u201cBeing able to find values and rituals but not having to believe in magic, that\u2019s a powerful thing,\u201d said A.J. Kumar, who served as the president of a Harvard humanist graduate student group that Mr. Epstein advised.",
      "Other Harvard chaplains have applauded Mr. Epstein\u2019s efforts to provide a campus home for those who are religiously unattached, skeptical but still searching. Some said his selection to lead the group, following its previous Jewish leader, seemed obvious.",
      "\u201cGreg was the first choice of a committee that was made up of a Lutheran, a Christian Scientist, an evangelical Christian and a Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed,\u201d said the Rev. Kathleen Reed, a Lutheran chaplain who chaired the nominating committee. \u201cWe\u2019re presenting to the university a vision of how the world could work when diverse traditions focus on how to be good humans and neighbors.\u201d",
      "And for some members of Harvard\u2019s humanist and atheist community, exploring humanism has brought with it a richer understanding of faith.",
      "Ms. Nickerson grew up in a working-class Catholic household where she struggled to connect with rituals like Mass. But during her freshman year at Harvard, she found herself capable of long, lively conversations with her devout grandmother. Ms. Nickerson realized that her involvement with Harvard humanism had given her the language to understand her grandmother\u2019s theology.",
      "Last spring, the two were tending roses and daylilies in the family garden when they got on the topic of surrender. Ms. Nickerson\u2019s grandmother reflected on the aspects of her life that were in God\u2019s hands; Ms. Nickerson agreed that it was important to recognize all the events beyond human control, though she does not believe there is a deity involved. Ms. Nickerson then shared a Buddhist parable that she had learned from the humanist club, which her grandmother later passed on to her Bible study group.",
      "\u201cWe understood the idea of surrender in a similar way even though one of those explanations came with God and the other didn\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Nickerson said. \u201cI find I\u2019m more fluid in my spiritual conversations now.\u201d"

      "This week, 227 virus deaths were being reported each day in Florida, on average, as of Tuesday, a record for the state and by far the most in the United States right now. The average for new known cases reached 23,314 a day on the weekend, 30 percent higher than the state\u2019s previous peak in January, according to a New York Times database. Across the country, new deaths have climbed to more than 1,000 a day, on average.",
      "And hospitalizations in Florida have almost tripled in the past month, according to federal data, stretching many hospitals to the breaking point. The surge prompted the mayor of Orlando to ask residents to conserve water to limit the strain on the city\u2019s supply of liquid oxygen, which is needed both to purify drinking water and to treat Covid-19 patients.",
      "Even as cases continue to surge, with more than 17,200 people hospitalized with the virus across Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has held firm on banning vaccine and mask mandates. Several school districts have gone ahead with mask mandates anyway.",
      "Overall, 52 percent of Floridians are fully vaccinated, but the figure is less than 30 percent in some of the state\u2019s hardest-hit counties.",
      "On Monday, dozens of doctors and hospital employees in Palm Beach County gathered for an early morning news conference to beseech the unvaccinated to get shots, emphasizing that the surge was overwhelming the health care system and destroying lives.",
      "\u201cWe are exhausted,\u201d said Dr. Rupesh Dharia, an internal medicine specialist. \u201cOur patience and resources are running low.\u201d",
      "A growing proportion of the people inundating hospitals and dying in Florida now are coming from younger segments of the population, particularly those ages 40 to 59, which were less vulnerable in earlier waves of the pandemic. The Delta variant is spreading among younger people, many who thought they were healthy and did not get vaccinated.",
      "Dr. Chirag Patel, the assistant chief medical officer of UF Health Jacksonville, a hospital system in Northeast Florida, said the patients hospitalized with the virus during this latest surge tended to be younger and had fewer other health issues, but were nearly all unvaccinated. Of those who have died, including patients ranging in age from their 20s to their 40s, more than 90 percent were not inoculated, Dr. Patel said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had more patients this time around that have passed away at a younger age with very few if any medical problems,\u201d he said. \u201cThey simply come in with Covid, and they don\u2019t make it out of the hospital.\u201d",
      "Two months ago, the number of Covid-19 patients admitted at the system\u2019s two University of Florida hospitals in Jacksonville was down to 14. On Tuesday morning, 188 coronavirus patients were in the hospitals, including 56 in the intensive care units.",
      "One of the hardest parts of his job, Dr. Patel said, is having to tell family members that their unvaccinated loved one had succumbed to the virus. \u201cIt\u2019s just such a senseless and preventable way of ultimately dying,\u201d he said."

      "\u201cWe look forward to discussing with public health officials a potential strategy for our Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine, boosting eight months or longer after the primary single-dose vaccination,\u201d Dr. Mathai Mammen, the global head of Janssen Research & Development at Johnson & Johnson, said in a statement.",
      "In February, the F.D.A. gave emergency authorization to Johnson & Johnson for its shot, which showed a 72 percent efficacy against infection in its U.S. clinical trial. That study was done before the Delta variant became widespread. But in another study released earlier this month, South African researchers found that the vaccine was up to 95 percent effective against death from Delta, and reduced the risk of hospitalization by 71 percent.",
      "In its new study, Johnson & Johnson tracked 17 volunteers from last year\u2019s clinical trial. When given a booster shot at six months, their antibodies against the coronavirus jumped nine times as high as after the first dose. The data has not yet been published in a scientific journal.",
      "Small studies of Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech booster shots have found comparable jumps in antibody levels, as the companies reported on recent earnings calls.",
      "On Wednesday, Pfizer and BioNTech released new data from 306 people showing that a third dose given five to eight months after the second caused a strong immune response. The level of antibodies against the coronavirus in the volunteers more than tripled, the companies reported.",
      "The side effects of a third injection were about the same as after the initial two doses, the companies said. The underlying data was not included in the news release, nor were the dates or location of the study specified. The companies said they were preparing a scientific publication describing the research.",
      "Pfizer and BioNTech said they were now applying to the F.D.A. for supplemental approval of a coronavirus vaccine booster shot for those aged 16 and up, and will submit all their supporting data by the end of this week.",
      "The news of the booster application came two days after the F.D.A. fully approved the companies\u2019 two-dose vaccine for those 16 and older, making it the first to move beyond emergency use status.",
      "Because booster shots from different companies have not been tested in a head-to-head comparison, it\u2019s not possible to determine which one provides the biggest boost.",
      "It\u2019s also hard to say if these big jumps in antibodies will translate into a highly effective booster shot.",
      "A number of studies have suggested that higher levels of antibodies provide better protection, especially against the Delta variant. But other parts of the immune system, such as T cells, are also important. So this data cannot give a precise estimate of how effective a booster shot will be against Covid-19.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too early to guesstimate protection,\u201d said Dr. Dan Barouch, a virologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, who has led some studies for Johnson & Johnson but was not involved in the booster trial.",
      "The new data from Johnson & Johnson may lay to rest some early concerns about whether more than one dose of the vaccine could be effective. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses an adenovirus to deliver coronavirus genes into cells. When the company launched its trials, some experts wondered if people would make antibodies against the adenoviruses, which might render a booster useless.",
      "\u201cSomething we previously would have considered to be a major barrier may not be such a huge barrier,\u201d said Lynda Coughlan, a virologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is the only shot in the United States or Europe authorized as a single dose. Since November, the company has been running a clinical trial to look at how much protection people get from two doses, two months apart. That trial is expected to deliver results in the next few weeks.",
      "After the volunteers in that trial received the second dose, their antibody levels rose by a factor of three. The much bigger increase in the new booster study is likely because of the longer wait between doses: A six-month pause gives the immune system time to develop a more mature response to the coronavirus.",
      "Only eight percent of vaccinated Americans \u2014 or about 14 million people \u2014 have received a Johnson & Johnson vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control. A federal official said that the government had sufficient supplies in reserve to give boosters to everyone who received a first dose of Johnson & Johnson, should it be authorized.",
      "The news of potential Johnson & Johnson boosters for Americans may sting in other countries that are still waiting for first doses of the vaccine. South Africa, for example, has ordered 31 million doses of the vaccine, but only two million people there have received it.",
      "It remains to be seen how long the high antibody levels produced by boosters will last. \u201cWe don\u2019t have long-term human studies, but my prediction would be that those responses should be maintained after the boost,\u201d Dr. Coughlan said."

    "title": "About 89% of Rental Assistance Funds Have Not Been Distributed, Figures Show",
    "content": [
      "The $46.5 billion rental aid program created to pay rent accrued during the pandemic continues to disburse money at a slow pace, as the White House braces for a Supreme Court order that could strike down a new national moratorium on evictions.",
      "The Emergency Rental Assistance Program, funded in the two federal pandemic relief packages passed over the last year, sputtered along in July, with just $1.7 billion being distributed by state and local governments, according to the Treasury Department, which oversees the program.",
      "The money meted out was a modest increase from the prior month, bringing the total aid disbursed to about $5.1 billion, figures released early Wednesday showed, or roughly 11 percent of the cash allocated by Congress to avoid an eviction crisis that many housing experts now see as increasingly likely.",
      "That cash was slated to be spent over three years, but White House officials \u2014 who have spent months pressuring local officials and tweaking the program to make access easier \u2014 had hoped states would have spent much more by now.",
      "\u201cAbout a million payments have now gone out to pay back rent for families \u2014 it is starting to help a meaningful number of families,\u201d said Gene Sperling, who oversees the operation of federal pandemic relief programs for President Biden.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just not close to enough in an emergency like this to protect all the families who need and deserve to be protected. So there is still way more to do and to do fast,\u201d he added.",
      "Data released by the Census Bureau on Wednesday illustrated the magnitude of the eviction risk.",
      "An estimated 1.2 million households are very likely to face eviction for nonpayment of rent over the next two months, according to the bureau\u2019s periodic Pulse survey, which extrapolated national totals from a pool of about 70,000 respondents who answered a survey this month.",
      "Of the roughly 2.8 million households that have applied for aid, only about 500,000 reported receiving assistance \u2014 another 1.5 million are waiting for approvals, while nearly 700,000 have been rejected, according to the estimates.",
      "And those are just the tenants who have tried to get access to the program: Over 60 percent of vulnerable renters have not even applied.",
      "To speed things up, Treasury announced another round of changes to the program, including a directive to local officials that they allow tenants to use self-reported financial information on aid applications as a first, rather than a last, resort, while granting permission for states to send out bulk payments to landlords and utility companies in anticipation of federal payouts to tenants.",
      "They are also expanding existing initiatives to prevent evictions at properties funded by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Agriculture Department and the Department of Veterans Affairs.",
      "Mr. Biden\u2019s domestic policy staff has mapped out policy contingencies if the Supreme Court strikes down the moratorium, which is the administration\u2019s principal safeguard for hundreds of thousands of low-income and working-class tenants hit hardest by the pandemic. White House lawyers expect a court decision this week.",
      "Mostly, the response will entail doubling down on existing efforts to speed up flow of the aid. But officials are likely to switch to a triage model, focusing on a handful of states and cities that have weak tenant protections, high backlogs of unpaid rent and low use of the federal rental assistance fund.",
      "The moratorium was initially put into effect by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in September under President Donald J. Trump. Mr. Biden extended it several times this year, but allowed it to briefly expire earlier this month. He reinstated it, in a slightly modified form, on Aug. 3 under pressure from congressional Democrats.",
      "That final 60-day extension, enacted over the objection of White House lawyers, was intended to buy more time to distribute the emergency rental assistance.",
      "The program is administered by the federal government, but it is up to states to build out a system to deliver aid to struggling renters and landlords, and that has been the main source of its problems.",
      "Treasury Department and White House officials acknowledged on a conference call Tuesday evening that the program was not ramping up fast enough to entirely prevent a wave of evictions, even if the justices allow it to remain in place until its scheduled expiration on Oct. 2.",
      "[Read more on why it\u2019s been so challenging getting aid to renters.]",
      "But they also cited progress. State and local agencies have begun to steadily increase payments to hundreds of thousands of households that were at risk of eviction, with most of those going to low-income tenants. They also believe the pace of payments has continued to accelerate in August.",
      "Administration officials continue to blame the program\u2019s struggles on local officials, many of whom are reluctant to take advantage of the new fast-track application process, which allows tenants to self-certify on applications, freeing them from the need to provide detailed documentation.",
      "The new guidance emphasized that applicants can \u201cself-attest\u201d to declare their eligibility for rental aid without the need for additional documentation. The Treasury Department believes that this will expedite the process by reducing cumbersome paperwork requirements.",
      "The Treasury Department also took action to empower nonprofit organizations to more quickly provide relief to tenants who are facing eviction.",
      "In recent weeks, local officials have complained that moving too fast on aid applications could lead to errors, fraud and audits; the White House has countered by telling them that those risks are insignificant compared with a wave of evictions hitting tenants who did not get their aid quickly enough to keep a roof over their heads.",
      "\u201cThey can and should use simpler applications, speedier processes and a self-attestation option without needless delays,\u201d Mr. Sperling said.",
      "Several states, including Texas, have been particularly effective in ramping up their aid distribution systems, officials said. But many others \u2014 especially New York, Florida, Tennessee, Ohio and South Carolina \u2014 have been sluggish, making tenants especially vulnerable to displacement once the moratorium is lifted, they said.",
      "But there are signs that things might be changing: New York released only a minuscule portion of its funding by Aug. 1, but has spent about $200 million in the last few weeks, according to a spokesman for the state agency that disburses the aid.",
      "Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York, who was sworn in this week, has said speeding up the system is one of her top priorities.",
      "States that have not used much of their money by the end of September could see their funds reallocated to other states that have been able to distribute it more effectively.",
      "It will take local housing courts weeks to clear the backlog of eviction cases delayed by the moratorium. But many owners, especially small landlords, have rejected the federal aid, arguing that evicting nonpaying tenants is not only their right but the most effective way of ensuring their revenue is not interrupted in the future.",
      "Last week, Wally Adeyemo, deputy Treasury secretary, traveled to Hyattsville, Md., to talk to landlords, tenants and administrators of a rental assistance program that has had success by using self-reported applications and census data to determine eligibility.",
      "Administration officials, worried that a new moratorium could be struck down at any time, are also turning to state courts \u2014 which adjudicate tenant-landlord disputes \u2014 to help deliver aid, by pressuring landlords to accept federal payments instead of proceeding with evictions, and educating tenants, who often have no legal representation in court, on their right to apply for assistance."

      "Spencer Elden was 4 months old when he was photographed by a family friend in 1991 drifting naked in a pool.",
      "The picture, taken at the Rose Bowl Aquatics Center in Pasadena, Calif., would be used that year for the cover of \u201cNevermind,\u201d Nirvana\u2019s seminal second album that helped define Generation X and rocketed the Seattle band to international fame.",
      "In the decades that followed, Mr. Elden appeared to celebrate his part in the classic cover, recreating the moment for the album\u2019s 10th, 17th, 20th and 25th anniversaries, though not naked.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s cool but weird to be part of something so important that I don\u2019t even remember,\u201d he said in 2016 in an interview with The New York Post, in which he posed holding the album cover at 25.",
      "Now, however, Mr. Elden, 30, has filed a federal lawsuit against the estate of Kurt Cobain, the musician\u2019s former bandmates, David Grohl and Krist Novoselic, and Mr. Cobain\u2019s widow, Courtney Love, among other parties. He claimed that they, along with Geffen Records, which released \u201cNevermind,\u201d profited from his naked image. It is one of the best-selling records of all time, with at least 30 million copies sold worldwide.",
      "\u201cDefendants knowingly produced, possessed, and advertised commercial child pornography depicting Spencer, and they knowingly received value in exchange for doing so,\u201d according to the lawsuit, which was filed on Tuesday in federal court in California.",
      "Mr. Elden suffered \u201cpermanent harm\u201d because of his association with the album, including emotional distress and a \u201clifelong loss of income-earning capacity.\u201d The lawsuit did not provide details about the losses and said they would be disclosed at trial.",
      "Mr. Elden, an artist living in Los Angeles County, has gone to therapy for years to work through how the album cover affected him, said Maggie Mabie, one of his lawyers.",
      "\u201cHe hasn\u2019t met anyone who hasn\u2019t seen his genitalia,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's a constant reminder that he has no privacy. His privacy is worthless to the world.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit said that Mr. Elden is seeking $150,000 from each of the 15 people and companies named in the complaint, including Kirk Weddle, the photographer who took the picture. Mr. Weddle did not respond to messages requesting comment.",
      "The photo of Mr. Elden was picked from among dozens of pictures of babies Mr. Weddle photographed for the album cover, which Mr. Cobain envisioned showing a baby underwater.",
      "Mr. Weddle paid Mr. Elden\u2019s parents $200 for the picture, which was later altered to show the baby chasing a dollar, dangling from a fishhook.",
      "\u201cThey were trying to create controversy because controversy sells,\u201d Ms. Mabie said. \u201cThe point was not just to create a menacing image but to cross the line and they did so in a way that exposed Spencer so that they could profit off of it.\u201d",
      "She said her client sometimes agreed when the band, media outlets and fans asked him to recreate the photo as an adult, but he eventually realized that this only resulted in the \u201cimage of him as a baby being further exploited.\u201d",
      "The representatives for Mr. Cobain\u2019s estate did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. Representatives for Mr. Grohl, Ms. Love, and Geffen Records, which is now part of Universal Music Group, did not respond to messages.",
      "Mr. Elden, who declined to comment on his suit, said in a short documentary in 2015 that the album cover had \u201copened doors\u201d for him. For example, he worked with Shepard Fairey, the artist who was sued by The Associated Press for using an image of Barack Obama for his piece \u201cHope.\u201d",
      "Over the years, he has expressed ambivalence about the cover.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019d be nice to have a quarter for every person that has seen my baby penis,\u201d he said in a New York Post interview in 2016.",
      "In a different interview that year, he said he was angry that people still talked about it.",
      "\u201cRecently I\u2019ve been thinking, \u2018What if I wasn\u2019t OK with my freaking penis being shown to everybody?\u2019 I didn\u2019t really have a choice,\u201d Mr. Elden said to GQ Australia.",
      "He said that his feelings about the cover began to change \u201cjust a few months ago, when I was reaching out to Nirvana to see if they wanted to be part of my art show.\u201d",
      "Mr. Elden said he was referred to managers and lawyers.",
      "\u201cWhy am I still on their cover if I\u2019m not that big of a deal?\u201d he said.",
      "Ms. Mabie said that Mr. Elden has long felt discomfort over the images and had expressed it in even earlier interviews when he was teenager.",
      "\u201cMr. Elden never consented to the use of this image or the display of these images,\u201d she said. \u201cEven though he recreated the images later on in life, he was clothed and he was an adult and these were very different circumstances.\u201d",
      "Ms. Mabie said his parents never authorized consent for how the images would be used.",
      "She noted that Mr. Cobain once suggested putting a sticker over the baby\u2019s genitals after there was pushback to the idea for the cover.",
      "The performer, who died in 1994, said the sticker should read: \u201cIf you\u2019re offended by this, you must be a closet pedophile.\u201d",
      "Mr. Elden is \u201casking for Nirvana to do what Nirvana should have done 30 years ago and redact the images of his genitalia from the album cover,\u201d Ms. Mabie said.",
      "This lawsuit is not a typical child pornography case, said Mary Graw Leary, a professor at the Columbus School of Law at the Catholic University of America.",
      "\u201cNudity of a child alone is not the definition of pornography,\u201d she said. \u201cThe typical child pornography that is being seen in law enforcement and pursued in the courts can be violent. The children are young and it is very graphic.\u201d",
      "But there are factors under federal law that allow a judge or a jury to determine whether a photo of a minor \u201cconstitutes a lascivious exhibition of the genitals,\u201d including if they were the focal point of a photo, Professor Graw Leary said.",
      "That part of the law \u201cgives a bit more discretion to the court,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a case with easy answers.\u201d",
      "Mr. Elden\u2019s past comments about the cover should not undermine his current claim that he was a victim of child pornography, she added. The law does not pick between children who immediately denounce their abusers and children who initially were dismissive about what happened to them, she said.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be in a position where we\u2019re only going to consider one case criminal because in the other, the child didn\u2019t think it was a big deal at the time,\u201d Professor Graw Leary said. \u201cWe don\u2019t only protect certain kids.\u201d"

    "content": [
      "Jean Breeze, a passionate Jamaican poet who reveled in the performance of dub poetry, a half-spoken, half-chanted style of storytelling often backed by the rhythms of reggae, died on Aug. 4 in Kingston, Jamaica. She was 65.",
      "Her death, in a hospital, was announced on social media by her British agency, Renaissance One Writers and Events. No cause was given, but she had been living with a chronic lung disease for years.",
      "Ms. Breeze, known as Binta, was widely acknowledged to be the first woman to make a name for herself in the male-dominated genre of dub poetry. (Dub is a recording term that refers to the process of adding or removing sounds.) The genre originated in Kingston in the 1970s and was amplified in London and Toronto, cities with large populations of Caribbean immigrants, and it was in England that Ms. Breeze rose to fame.",
      "She stood out for the passion of her performances, the raw honesty of her personal stories and her use of Jamaica\u2019s lyrical vernacular. In the late 1990s, the poet Maya Angelou asked Ms. Breeze to perform at her 70th birthday party. Accompanied by a gospel choir, Ms. Breeze recited so movingly that Ms. Angelou immediately walked across the stage and embraced her.",
      "In her poem \u201cThe Garden Path\u201d (2000), Ms. Breeze described her poetic vision. \u201cI want to make words music, move beyond language into sound,\u201d she wrote. She was credited with blending Jamaican patois with standard English to create innovative poetic forms and rhythms.",
      "\u201cFor me, a key feature of her legacy as a Caribbean poet is in how she beautifully embodied the intersection between literary rigor and performance power,\u201d Owen Blakka Ellis, a longtime friend, told the website Global Voices.",
      "One of Ms. Breeze\u2019s most vivid childhood memories was of her grandmother sitting in her bedroom and reciting poetry by heart to her every night.",
      "\u201cSo it came from a voice not a page,\u201d she told the journal Marxism Today in 1988. \u201cThe voice is as important as the poem because it brings life to the word,\u201d she said. This, she added, was the reason she placed such an emphasis on performance.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell in advance what a reading is going to be like,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s very painful, and sometimes it\u2019s very freeing. But it is always a communication.\u201d",
      "Her work drew on diverse influences, what Marxism Today called \u201cthe reluctant melting pot that is London, her rural Jamaican childhood and the urban angst of Kingston.\u201d Her major themes included the struggles and exploitation of women, political oppression and mental illness.",
      "Ms. Breeze was diagnosed with schizophrenia in her early 20s, and her work was replete with references to what she called \u201cmadness.\u201d In \u201cRiddym Ravings and Other Poems\u201d (1988), one of her early works, the \u201cravings\u201d of the title are those of a homeless woman sitting on a park bench. It was also known as \u201cThe Mad Woman\u2019s Poem.\u201d",
      "At the same time, much of her work was joyful. Other collections include \u201cOn the Edge of An Island\u201d (1997); \u201cThe Arrival of Brighteye and Other Poems\u201d (2000), which included a version of Chaucer\u2019s Wife of Bath tale; \u201cThe Fifth Figure\u201d (2006), about five generations of Black British women; and \u201cThird World Girl: Selected Poems\u201d (2011). She made several recordings, including \u201cRiding on de Riddym\u201d (1996), and collaborated with the African American a cappella group Sweet Honey in the Rock.",
      "Ms. Breeze divided her time between Jamaica and England and performed regularly at literary festivals. She was also a theater director, choreographer, actor and teacher, and she wrote for television and film. She settled for a time in the Midlands town of Leicester, where she taught creative writing as an honorary fellow at Leicester University\u2019s School of English.",
      "Ms. Breeze was born Jean Lumsden on March 11, 1956, in rural Jamaica. Her father was a public health inspector and her mother studied to be a midwife. Jean was raised chiefly by her grandparents, who were farmers, in Patty Hill, a village in the hills of Hanover.",
      "She emerged as a dub poet by happenstance.",
      "After high school, she taught and practiced Rastafarianism. One day she heard on the radio \u2014 from which she often took guidance \u2014 the Otis Redding song \u201cSitting on the Dock of the Bay.\u201d It inspired her to catch a bus to Montego Bay, about 15 miles away, and sit on a pier there while waiting to see who might come along.",
      "A Rasta man eventually saw her writing and asked if she were a poet. She said she was. He told her that there was a party that night in honor of Haile Selassie, the last emperor of Ethiopia, who is revered by Rastafarians. The man asked her if she wanted to read a poem there and invited her to a rehearsal with a band.",
      "When she showed up, the renowned Jamaican dub poet Mutabaruka was at the rehearsal. He told the band to back her with a particular rhythm. She then recited her poem \u201cSlip, ya fool.\u201d Muta, as he was called, loved her performance and took her to a studio to record the work.",
      "\u201cAnd in a month,\u201d she said in a 2018 interview with the journal Contemporary Women\u2019s Writing, \u201cI had the first recording played on radio in Jamaica as the first female dub poet.\u201d",
      "She then enrolled in the Jamaica School of Drama in Kingston.",
      "By then, a brief marriage to Brian Breese, one of her former teachers, had ended. (She changed her surname to Breeze.) Her survivors include a son, Gareth Breese, a noted West Indies cricketer, and two daughters, Imega and Caribe.",
      "A turning point came when Ms. Breeze met Linton Kwesi Johnson, a prominent Jamaican dub poet, who invited her to perform at the International Book Fair of Radical Black and Third World Books in 1985. She was soon touring and performing around the world.",
      "Ms. Breeze was especially popular in England and was appointed a member of the Order of the British Empire in 2012 by Queen Elizabeth II for her services to literature. She had thought earlier that if she ever won such an honor, she would reject it because she opposed the notion of empire and colonization. But when the time came, she was delighted to accept.",
      "\u201cI have always had a kind of soft spot for the queen, because I see her as a mother figure in a big family trying her best to keep the kids in line,\u201d Ms. Breeze told The Jamaica Observer in 2012. \u201cAnd I said to myself, \u2018There goes my mother.\u2019\u201d"

      "For years, looted antiquities have been a law enforcement priority, not only because the smuggling of ancient artifacts damages the cultural heritage of their countries of origin, but because illicit sales have sometimes financed the operation of drug gangs or terror organizations.",
      "But prosecutors say Mehrdad Sadigh, a New York antiquities dealer whose Sadigh Gallery has operated for decades in the shadow of the Empire State Building, decided not to go to the trouble of acquiring ancient items.",
      "He made bogus copies instead, they say, creating thousands of phony antiquities in a warren of offices just off his display area and then marketing them to unsophisticated and overeager collectors.",
      "\u201cFor many years, this fake antiquities mill based in midtown Manhattan promised customers rare treasures from the ancient world and instead sold them pieces manufactured on-site in cookie-cutter fashion,\u201d the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr., said in a statement after Mr. Sadigh was arrested earlier this month.",
      "Mr. Sadigh has pleaded not guilty to charges of scheming to defraud, grand larceny, criminal possession of a forged instrument, forgery and criminal simulation.",
      "Among the people he sold to, according to prosecutors, were undercover federal investigators who bought a gold pendant depicting the death mask of Tutankhamen and a marble portrait head of an ancient Roman woman \u2014 paying $4,000 for each. Those sales became the basis for a visit to the gallery in August by members of the district attorney\u2019s office and Homeland Security investigations, who said they found hundreds of fake artifacts displayed on shelves and inside glass cases. Thousands more, they said, were found in the rooms behind the gallery \u2014 including scarabs, statuettes and spear heads in differing stages of preparation.",
      "Matthew Bogdanos, the chief of the district attorney\u2019s Antiquities Trafficking Unit, said in an interview that the visit revealed a sort of assembly-line process that seemed designed to distress and otherwise alter mass-produced items of recent vintage so they would appear aged. Investigators, he said, found varnish, spray paints, a belt sander and mudlike substances of different hues and consistencies, among other tools and materials.",
      "Gary Lesser, a lawyer for Mr. Sadigh, declined to comment on Tuesday.",
      "The district attorney\u2019s office said that Mr. Sadigh appeared to be among the biggest purveyors of fake artifacts in the country based on the longevity of his business, the number of items seized from his gallery and his \u201csubstantial financial gains.\u201d",
      "Mr. Sadigh had operated his gallery for decades, advertising it on its website as \u201ca family-owned art gallery specializing in ancient artifacts and coins from around the world.\u201d",
      "Established in 1978 as a small mail-order company, the website said that in 1982 the gallery moved to a suite of offices on an upper floor of a building at Fifth Avenue and East 31st Street.",
      "From his location there, Mr. Sadigh offered for sale items that he said were ancient Anatolian, Babylonian, Byzantine, Greco-Roman, Mesopotamian and Sumerian. The gallery\u2019s website featured a blog on antiquities and testimonials from satisfied customers. Google reviews posted online were filled with accounts from clients, some of whom said they had been shopping there for years and many of whom mentioned personal service they appreciated.",
      "Among the items listed for sale on the website in late 2020 and early 2021 were a mummified falcon dated to 305-30 B.C. ($9,000), an Egyptian sarcophagus mask carved from wood and dated to 663-525 B.C. ($5,000), and an iron and nickel fragment from a meteorite that landed in Mongolia ($1,500).",
      "\u201cAll of our antiquities are guaranteed authentic,\u201d the site stated.",
      "Mr. Sadigh came to the attention of investigators when other dealers being pursued for trafficking looted antiquities complained, Mr. Bogdanos said, that \u201cthe guy selling all the fakes\u201d was being overlooked.",
      "When investigators looked into the Sadigh Gallery, Mr. Bogdanos said, they found not a sidewalk peddler of cheap knockoffs, but someone \u201ctoo big to not investigate.\u201d",
      "Among the items Mr. Bogdanos recognized in the gallery was a copy of an 11th-century ceramic Khmer sculpture of a Buddha; the original had been seized by the district attorney\u2019s office in a separate case. Other items in the gallery appeared to be modeled after objects that had been stolen from the Iraq Museum, thefts Mr. Bogdanos had a hand in investigating while serving as a Marine colonel in Iraq in 2003.",
      "(Mr. Bogdanos led an effort to recover thousands of items taken by looters during the fall of Baghdad.)",
      "After Mr. Sadigh\u2019s arrest, prosecutors obtained a second warrant allowing them to search for tools used in the modification of antiquities or \u201cobjects purporting to be antiquities\u201d as well as items like a sarcophagus valued at $50,000, a cylinder seal valued at $40,000 and a statue of the goddess Artemis valued at $25,000, all suspected of being fakes.",
      "Despite his positive reviews online, Mr. Sadigh had previously been associated with a dispute over the authenticity of items he had sold.",
      "In 2019, the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum in Iowa canceled a planned visiting exhibition after Bjorn Anderson, an art history professor at the University of Iowa, said that \u201cthe majority\u201d of its items appeared to be fakes once sold by the Sadigh gallery",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about this,\u201d Mr. Sadigh said in response, according to The West Branch Times, which reported the cancellation in 2019."

    "title": "Biden Sticks to Afghan Deadline, Resisting Pleas to Extend Evacuation",
    "content": [
      "President Biden said Tuesday that the United States intended to withdraw completely from Afghanistan at the end of the month as planned, rebuffing pleas from Britain, France and other NATO allies to keep troops in Kabul and hastening the end of a frantic evacuation that has become a grim coda to two decades of war.",
      "Even as Mr. Biden spoke from the White House, officials said the United States had already begun to reduce its military presence at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, sending about 300 of the 5,800 Marines and soldiers home in anticipation of the conclusion of their rescue mission within a week.",
      "\u201cThe sooner we can finish, the better,\u201d the president said, hours after informing world leaders of his intentions during an emergency virtual meeting. Citing the threat from an Islamic State affiliate known as ISIS-K and operating in Afghanistan, he said that \u201cevery day we\u2019re on the ground is another day we know that ISIS-K is seeking to target the airport, attack both U.S. and allied forces and innocent civilians.\u201d",
      "But Mr. Biden did not close the door to extending what has become an immense evacuation effort. He said that he had asked the Pentagon and the State Department for contingency plans in case it became necessary to stay longer.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m determined to ensure that we complete our mission,\u201d he said.",
      "The president said that more than 70,000 people had been ferried out of harm\u2019s way since Aug. 14, the day before the Taliban swept into power in Kabul; on Tuesday, the Pentagon reported its biggest number of daily evacuations from the Kabul airport so far, saying it had airlifted 21,600 people out of the country over 24 hours.",
      "The fast-approaching American withdrawal coincided with a threat by the Taliban to stop Afghans from traveling to the airport, which crowds have mobbed for days, under pitiless sun and at risk of brutal attacks by militants. It was an ominous sign that for the thousands of people still desperate to leave, the window may already be slamming shut.",
      "The rapidly unfolding developments came as the world leaders pledged unity in the face of the changing landscape in Afghanistan and the C.I.A. director met secretly with the Taliban\u2019s leader. But the flurry of diplomacy failed to alter a harrowing dynamic: The Taliban are tightening their grip, the Americans are leaving and the options for countries scrambling to extract their citizens and Afghan allies are dwindling.",
      "Even though the pace of evacuations has accelerated in recent days, the number of people airlifted out is well below the total number of Americans, foreign citizens and Afghan allies who are trying to leave the country. And the timetable for civilian evacuations is probably significantly shorter than a week.",
      "The Pentagon spokesman, John F. Kirby, said it would take several days to remove all of the 5,800 troops who are securing Kabul\u2019s airport, as well as their equipment. At some point in the coming days, the military\u2019s focus will shift from evacuations to the drawdown.",
      "As crowds continued to throng the airport, the Taliban sought to assert their authority over a country they conquered in lightning fashion. A spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said Taliban militants would block Afghans from the airport for their own safety and reiterated that the United States must leave by Aug. 31.",
      "\u201cThe road that ends at the Kabul airport has been blocked,\u201d Mr. Mujahid said at a news conference on Tuesday. \u201cForeigners can go through it, but Afghans are not allowed to take the road.\u201d",
      "For the first time, the Taliban warned women to stay off the streets and not to go to their jobs \u2014 also ostensibly for their own safety and only as a temporary measure. It was a chilling portent of the harsh repression that the Taliban imposed on women and girls the last time they ruled Afghanistan.",
      "\u201cWe are worried our forces, who are new and have not yet been trained very well, may mistreat women,\u201d Mr. Mujahid said. \u201cUntil we have a new procedure, they should stay home. They won\u2019t be counted as absent, and their salaries will be paid in their homes.\u201d",
      "The White House has conducted its own outreach to the Taliban, dispatching the C.I.A. director, William J. Burns, to Kabul this week for talks with the Taliban leadership, according to American officials familiar with his visit.",
      "Mr. Burns, a longtime diplomat who conducted secret nuclear talks with Iran during the Obama administration, met on Monday with Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Taliban leader who led diplomatic negotiations in Qatar with the United States government.",
      "It was not clear whether Mr. Burns made much headway, either on the Aug. 31 deadline or broader human rights or security issues. But in his remarks at the White House on Tuesday, the president expressed nervousness about relying on assurances from the Taliban despite the high-level diplomatic outreach.",
      "\u201cThus far, the Taliban have been taking steps to work with us so we can get our people out,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a tenuous situation. We\u2019ve already had some gun fighting break out. We run a serious risk of it breaking down, as time goes on.\u201d",
      "Mr. Biden also rejected calls from lawmakers in both parties, who urged some of his top officials to extend the Aug. 31 deadline during a closed-door briefing on Capitol Hill, arguing that it would not be possible to evacuate all Americans and Afghan allies by then.",
      "\u201cThere is a broad bipartisan agreement within the United States Congress that we have to get American citizens out and we have to get our Afghan partners and allies out,\u201d said Representative Jason Crow, Democrat of Colorado, who is a former Army Ranger. \u201cThat can\u2019t be accomplished between now and the end of the month, so the date has to extend until we get that mission done.\u201d",
      "For weeks, members of Congress have been inundated with thousands of pleas from American citizens and Afghans trying to escape Afghanistan. Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the Foreign Affairs Committee, said that if the president did not extend the withdrawal date, \u201che will have blood on his hands.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople are going to die, and they are going to be left behind,\u201d Mr. McCaul said.",
      "Mr. Biden has emphasized that he was taking the threats to the safety of Americans in Kabul seriously. In a closed-door meeting with leaders of the Group of 7 nations on Tuesday, the president told them that the danger of a terrorist attack was \u201cvery high,\u201d according to a senior American official.",
      "A deadly attack against American and Afghan civilians by ISIS-K would be a disaster not only for the United States, but also for the Taliban, who are moving to consolidate control over Kabul. The Taliban and the Islamic State have been enemies, fighting each other on the battlefield for control of parts of the country.",
      "ISIS-K refers to the Islamic State\u2019s Khorasan affiliate in Afghanistan.",
      "Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, who led the meeting, sought to put a good face on the discussions, saying the evacuation had been remarkably successful. He said leaders had agreed on a road map for dealing with the Taliban in the long term, vowing to use Afghan funds held in Western banks as a lever to pressure the Taliban.",
      "\u201cThe No. 1 condition is that they\u2019ve got to guarantee, right the way through to Aug. 31 and beyond, safe passage for those who want to come out,\u201d Mr. Johnson said to the BBC after the meeting.",
      "But Mr. Johnson failed in his effort to persuade Mr. Biden to extend the evacuation beyond Aug. 31, and it was not clear what other options the allies had to protect their own citizens and Afghan allies without American military might.",
      "Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said that plans were being made to find a way to ensure that \u201cafterward we can still get as many local employees and people needing protection to be allowed to leave the country.\u201d But her downbeat tone laid bare the sense of futility felt by Western leaders about Afghanistan.",
      "\u201cHow can it be that the Afghan leader left the country so quickly?\u201d Ms. Merkel said. \u201cHow can it be that Afghan soldiers who we trained for so long gave up so quickly? We will have to ask these questions, but they were not the most pressing today.\u201d",
      "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, who broke away from campaigning to attend the meeting, said that Canadian troops would stay in Afghanistan to continue evacuations beyond Aug. 31 if it was necessary and possible.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to work every single day to get as many people out alongside our allies,\u201d Mr. Trudeau told reporters in Hamilton, Ontario, before boarding a campaign bus. \u201cThe commitment by our fellow G7 nations is clear: We\u2019re all going to work together to save as many people as possible.\u201d",
      "The meeting, however, came at a moment of acute strain in the trans-Atlantic alliance, with Britain and other allies bruised by what they view as the White House\u2019s lack of consultation on the timing or tactics of the withdrawal.",
      "Diplomats said the meeting was important to clear the air and prevent the chaotic withdrawal from undermining other joint efforts in security and counterterrorism. But it also demonstrated yet again the impotence of European allies, who acknowledged they could not stay in Kabul after the United States left.",
      "\u201cThe withdrawal was pathetically botched but a tactical defeat doesn\u2019t make a strategic one,\u201d said G\u00e9rard Araud, a former French ambassador to the United States. \u201cAll the pillars of U.S. power are intact.\u201d",
      "Wolfgang Ischinger, a former German ambassador to Washington, said: \u201cThere is serious loss of trust, and that will require a significant reassurance effort by Washington. But the real lesson from this for Europe is this: Do we really want to be totally dependent on U.S. capabilities and decisions forever, or can Europe finally begin to be serious about becoming a credible strategic actor?\u201d",
      "In Taliban-controlled Kabul, the questions were more elemental. With banks closed, cash scarce, food prices rising and public services unavailable, Afghans were struggling to make sense of what life would be like under their new rulers.",
      "Kabul\u2019s streets were unusually quiet, in contrast to the havoc playing out at the airport. To some, however, the quiet carried its own air of menace. One man said it showed that people were hiding in their homes, \u201cscared and terrorized.\u201d"

    "title": "Abundance of Jan. 6 Evidence Collides With Suspects\u2019 Right to Speedy Trials",
    "content": [
      "As the case of Timothy Hale-Cusanelli, a suspect in the Jan. 6 riot, was poised in late July to drag into its seventh month without much progress, the presiding judge lost patience with the prosecutor.",
      "The government, he suggested, had created a kind of vicious circle.",
      "Mr. Hale-Cusanelli, a Hitler impersonator accused of storming the Capitol, was in jail awaiting trial even as prosecutors kept filing charges against new defendants in the riot. The more arrests that were made, the judge, Trevor N. McFadden, reasoned, the more evidence generated that needed to be given to the defense; and the more evidence that had to be turned over, the longer it would take to resolve Mr. Hale-Cusanelli\u2019s case.",
      "Trying to assuage Judge McFadden, the prosecutor noted that the investigation of Jan. 6 was a uniquely challenging ordeal and that handing over all of this so-called discovery material was an important part of the legal process.",
      "The judge was not impressed. \u201cFreedom is also important,\u201d he shot back.",
      "That exchange was emblematic of a legal tension simmering in a number of cases stemming from the Capitol attack. It has, in essence, pitted the government\u2019s herculean efforts to gather and organize the evidence collected in its sprawling investigation of the riot against the constitutional right of defendants to speedy trials.",
      "It is rare for cases to be dismissed for speedy trial infractions. But if proceedings continue to drag on, detained defendants like Mr. Hale-Cusanelli could be released as their cases move through the courts.",
      "There are any number of ways to describe the scope of the government\u2019s Capitol riot prosecution. To name just one, the Justice Department has brought charges against over 560 people, more than in any other single investigation since its founding in 1870.",
      "Moreover, because much of the riot was caught on camera and social media, the amount of discovery material it has created has also been enormous. Prosecutors have collected tens of thousands of hours of video footage from surveillance cameras inside the Capitol and from body cameras worn by the police. There are disks full of cellphone tower readings, flash drives of radio transmissions, hundreds of thousands of tips from individuals, and reams of texts and photographs from thousands of cellphones seized by federal agents. The government has said that it has gathered more than one million posts from the conservative social media app Parler alone.",
      "Complicating matters, the rioters on Jan. 6 moved as a mob, often working in proximity or concert. That has meant that much of the discovery data is \u201coverlapping and interlocking,\u201d as prosecutors have said, and needs to be shared with multiple defendants.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t compare to any case that has ever occurred in the history of our government,\u201d a prosecutor said at Mr. Hale-Cusanelli\u2019s hearing.",
      "To organize the material, the government has established a squad of prosecutors, the Capitol breach discovery team, which meets regularly with counterparts in the Washington Federal Defenders Office. In May, it also signed a contract with Deloitte Financial Advisory Services to create a database intended to allow defense lawyers to find evidence related to their clients and search for videos by location on the Capitol grounds.",
      "But the process of setting up the database has not been smooth or quick. Judge McFadden ribbed the leader of the discovery team, Emily A. Miller, on Monday in court.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t envy you your job,\u201d he added.",
      "She responded, \u201cNo one does.\u201d",
      "While several judges have questioned prosecutors about speedy trial concerns and have promised consequences if delays persist, Judge McFadden, a Trump appointee, has been the most consistently \u2014 and vocally \u2014 critical of the government.",
      "The hearing on Monday, for example, came in the case of Couy Griffin, the founder of a group called Cowboys for Trump, who is not in pretrial custody and was recently offered a deal to plead guilty to the charges he is facing. The fact that Judge McFadden raised concerns about the pacing of his case \u2014 which appears to be on a path toward resolution \u2014 suggested that he might have broad problems with how the government was conducting its prosecution overall.",
      "Ms. Miller began the hearing by laying out the familiar litany of discovery materials the government had collected \u2014 videos, texts, photos, social media posts \u2014 and then suggested it was in the interest of Mr. Griffin and other defendants to allow prosecutors time to cull through the evidence for them. In a filing that morning, she and a colleague had made a similar argument, writing that whenever delays occurred, they were at least partly caused by prosecutors searching their files for potentially exculpatory evidence like \u201cimages of officers hugging or fist-bumping rioters.\u201d",
      "But Judge McFadden returned to the issue of new arrests, arguing that the government had created its own challenges by continuing to file them, increasing the pool of relevant discovery.",
      "\u201cThis just doesn\u2019t seem sustainable,\u201d he said.",
      "Some legal experts said that remarks like those might not necessarily result in serious penalties and could be little more than a judge using his bully pulpit to nudge complex cases toward completion.",
      "\u201cI suspect that judges are using the law to poke and prod at prosecutors, not necessarily to make dramatic decisions,\u201d said Jeffrey L. Fisher, a professor at Stanford Law School.",
      "Still, lawyers keep bringing up the issue.",
      "A couple of weeks ago, a lawyer for Robert Gieswein, a Colorado man who was among the first rioters to break into the Capitol, urged Judge Emmet G. Sullivan to keep what is known as the speedy trial clock running in the case. Under federal law, a trial must begin within 70 days of a defendant being formally indicted, though the clock can be paused for various reasons.",
      "Echoing Judge McFadden, Mr. Gieswein\u2019s lawyer, Ann Mason Rigby, told Judge Sullivan that the delays were the fault of the government, which kept arresting people, increasing the amount of evidence that had to be collected, processed and turned over to the defense.",
      "Judge Sullivan, however, saw the matter differently. He suggested that the fault lay not in the number of the government\u2019s arrests but in the number of rioters who breached the Capitol.",
      "\u201cThe problem,\u201d he said, \u201cstarted on Jan. 6 itself.\u201d"

    "title": "The Pandemic Is Testing the Federal Reserve\u2019s New Policy Plan",
    "content": [
      "When Jerome H. Powell speaks at the Federal Reserve\u2019s biggest annual conference on Friday, he will do so at a tense economic moment, as prices rise rapidly while millions of jobs remain missing from the labor market. That combination promises to test the meaning of a quiet revolution the central bank chair ushered in one year ago.",
      "Mr. Powell used his remarks at last year\u2019s conference, known as the Jackson Hole economic symposium and held by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, to announce that Fed officials would no longer raise interest rates to cool off the economy just because joblessness was falling and inflation was expected to heat up. They first wanted proof that prices were climbing sustainably, and they would welcome gains slightly above their 2 percent goal.",
      "He was laying groundwork for a far more patient Fed approach, acknowledging the grim reality that across advanced economies, interest rates, growth and inflation had spent the 21st century slipping lower in a strength-sapping downward spiral. The goal was to stop the decline.",
      "But a year later, that backdrop has shifted, at least superficially. Big government spending in response to the pandemic has pushed consumption and growth higher in the United States, and inflation has rocketed to levels not seen in more than a decade. The labor market is swiftly healing, though it has yet to fully recover. Now it falls to Mr. Powell to explain why full-blast support from the Fed remains necessary.",
      "Investors initially expected Mr. Powell to use Friday\u2019s remarks at the Jackson Hole conference to lay out the Fed\u2019s plan for \u201ctapering\u201d \u2014 or slowing down \u2014 a large-scale bond buying program it has been using to support the economy. Fed officials are debating the timing of such a move, which will mark their first step toward a more normal policy setting. But after minutes from the central bank\u2019s July meeting suggested that the discussion remained far from resolved, and as the Delta variant pushes coronavirus infections higher and threatens the economic outlook, few now anticipate a clear announcement.",
      "\u201cTwo to three months ago, people were expecting the whole taper plan at Jackson Hole,\u201d said Priya Misra, head of global rates strategy at TD Securities. \u201cNow, it\u2019s more the economic outlook that people are struggling with.\u201d",
      "Mr. Powell\u2019s speech, which will be virtual, could instead give him a chance to explain how the Fed is thinking about Delta variant risks, recent rapid inflation and labor market progress \u2014 and how all three square with the central bank\u2019s policy approach.",
      "The Fed is buying $120 billion in government-backed bonds each month, and it has kept its main interest rate near zero since March 2020. Both policies make borrowing cheap, fueling spending by businesses and households and bolstering the labor market.",
      "Officials have clearly linked their interest rate plans to their new framework: They said in September that they would not lift rates until the job market reached full employment. Bond buying ties back less directly, but it serves as a signal of the Fed\u2019s continued patience.",
      "Critics of the Fed\u2019s wait-and-see stance have questioned whether it is wise for the Fed to buy mortgage-backed and Treasury debt at a rapid clip when home prices have soared and inflation has been taking off. Republican lawmakers and some prominent Democrats alike have worried that the Fed is being insufficiently nimble as economic conditions change.",
      "\u201cThey chose a framework that was designed to provide a commitment to a highly dovish policy,\u201d said Lawrence H. Summers, a Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration and an economist at Harvard University. \u201cThe problem morphed into overheating being the big concern, rather than underheating.\u201d",
      "Inflation jumped to 4 percent in June, based on the Fed\u2019s preferred measure. Most economists expect rapid price gains to fade as pandemic-related supply bottlenecks clear up, but it is unclear how quickly and fully that will happen.",
      "And while there are still nearly seven million fewer jobs than there were before the pandemic, unfilled positions have jumped, wages for lower earners are taking off, and employers widely complain about being unable to hire enough workers. If labor costs remain higher, that, too, could cause longer-lasting inflation pressures.",
      "Some Fed officials would prefer to slow bond purchases soon, and fast, so that the central bank is in a position to raise interest rates next year if price pressures do become pernicious.",
      "Other policymakers see today\u2019s rising prices and job openings as trends that are destined to abate. Companies will work through supply-chain disruptions, and consumers will spend away savings they amassed from government stimulus checks and months stuck at home. Workers will settle into jobs. When things return to normal, they reason, the tepid inflation of years past will probably return.",
      "Given that view, and the fact that the labor market is still missing so many positions, they argue that the Fed\u2019s new policy paradigm calls for patience.",
      "At the central bank\u2019s meeting in late July, minutes showed, a few officials fretted that the Fed \u201cwould need to be mindful of the risk that a tapering announcement that was perceived to be premature could bring into question the committee\u2019s commitment to its new monetary policy framework.\u201d",
      "Mr. Powell typically tries to balance both concerns in his public remarks, acknowledging that inflation could remain elevated and pledging that the Fed will react if it does. But he has also emphasized that recent price pops are more likely to fade and that the central bank would prefer to remain helpful as the labor market healed.",
      "But in the months ahead, the Fed will need to make actual decisions, putting the meaning of its new framework to a very public test. Economists generally expect the central bank to announce a plan to slow its bond purchases in November or December.",
      "Once that taper is underway, attention will turn to interest rates, most likely with inflation still above 2 percent and the labor market recovery still at risk. When the Fed lifts rates will determine just how transformative the new policy framework has been.",
      "As of the Fed\u2019s June economic forecasts, most officials did not expect to raise borrowing costs from rock bottom until 2023. If that transpires, it will be a notable shift from years past, one that allows the labor market to heal much more completely before significantly removing monetary help.",
      "In 2015, when the Fed last lifted interest rates from near zero, the joblessness rate was 5 percent and 77 percent of people between the ages of 25 and 54 worked. Already, joblessness is 5.4 percent and 78 percent of prime-age adults work.",
      "In fact, Fed officials projected that rates would remain on hold even as joblessness fell to 3.8 percent by the end of next year \u2014 below their estimate of the rate consistent with full employment in the longer run, which is about 4 percent.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the most exciting part of what\u2019s changed: They\u2019re shooting for an ambitious prepandemic labor market,\u201d said Skanda Amarnath, executive director of Employ America, a group that tries to persuade economic policymakers to focus on jobs. \u201cSome fig leaf of progress is not enough.\u201d",
      "But risks loom in both directions.",
      "If inflation remains high and an overly sanguine Fed has to rapidly reverse course to try to contain it, that could precipitate a painful recession.",
      "But if the Fed withdraws support unnecessarily, the labor market could take longer to heal, and investors might see the changes that Mr. Powell announced last year as a minor tweak rather than a meaningful commitment to raising inflation and fostering a more inclusive labor market.",
      "In that case, the economy might plunge back into a cycle of long-run stagnation, much like the one that has confronted Japan and much of Europe.",
      "\u201cThis is going to be an episode that will test the patience and credibility of the Federal Reserve,\u201d said David Wilcox, a former Fed staff official who is now director of U.S. economics research at Bloomberg Economics."

      "Massachusetts has not joined the list of states \u2014 including New Jersey, Oregon and Washington \u2014 that require teachers to get the vaccine. According to a New York Times data tracker, 75 percent of Massachusetts\u2019s population has received at least one dose, a higher rate than any state except Vermont.",
      "Under the current plan, nearly all public school students over age 5, regardless of vaccination status, will be expected to wear masks inside Massachusetts school buildings until at least October, when state officials will allow individual schools to lift the mandate as long as 80 percent of staff and students are vaccinated. Unvaccinated people would be required to continue wearing masks.",
      "Merrie Najimy, president of the Massachusetts Teachers Association, called the vote \u201ca significant advancement toward keeping our communities safe.\u201d The union, the state\u2019s largest, voted on Aug. 1 in favor of a mask mandate in schools."

      "When they might be fully approved remains unclear. Dr. Peter Marks, the F.D.A.\u2019s top vaccine regulator, declined to specify a timeline for Moderna\u2019s approval in a call with reporters on Monday.",
      "Dr. Marks did note that the approval for Pfizer\u2019s vaccine took only 97 days from the time the company submitted its data, less than half the time of a typical approval period. The exhaustive process was expedited by a \u201ctireless team\u201d that \u201cworked day and night to get this done,\u201d he said, adding that regulators were \u201chighly rigorous\u201d despite the short timeline.",
      "Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, said in a series of interviews on Tuesday that he hoped the F.D.A. would soon be able to move forward to give full approval to the next vaccine.",

      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a temporal issue,\u201d he continued. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything different necessarily about the process, it\u2019s just that they submitted or are submitting their material a bit later or after Pfizer did.\u201d",
      "Full federal approval could make vaccines more palatable to the more than 80 million people around the country who have not been vaccinated yet, Dr. Fauci said on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on MSNBC, citing a survey that found that about a third of them were waiting for the F.D.A.\u2019s imprimatur before getting a shot.",
      "Dr. Fauci also said that he thought advertising for the vaccine, which is allowed now that it has been approved, might increase uptake, and that approval would spur more vaccine mandates from businesses, colleges and local governments.",
      "President Biden encouraged such mandates in an address on Monday. The Pentagon announced that it would require all 1.4 million active duty troops to be vaccinated, New Jersey said that all teachers would need to get shots or weekly testing, and the State University of New York announced a vaccination requirement for its students.",
      "Vaccine mandates and other protective measures have taken on greater urgency as the extremely infectious Delta variant has driven a surge in cases nationwide and overwhelmed hospitals in many states. The seven-day average of known deaths connected to the coronavirus has risen above 1,000 for the first time since March 2021, according to data collected by The New York Times.",
      "Starting Sept. 20, the federal government plans to provide booster shots for people eight months after their second vaccine doses, assuming federal regulators clear extra doses.",
      "Nearly 65 million people have been vaccinated with Moderna\u2019s shot, and nearly 14 million with Johnson & Johnson\u2019s, compared with more than 92 million people who have been vaccinated with Pfizer\u2019s, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Just over 60 percent of people eligible for the vaccine in the United States have been fully vaccinated.",
      "Children ages 12 to 15 can still get Pfizer\u2019s vaccine under the emergency use authorization; none of the vaccines have been authorized for children younger than 12.",
      "In July, federal regulators pressed both Pfizer and Moderna to expand the sizes of trials in children ages 5 to 11 to detect rare side effects, including heart inflammation problems that have turned up in people younger than 30. Pfizer appeared to be on a faster track to secure an emergency use authorization for young children at the time.",
      "Dr. Fauci said that pharmaceutical companies and federal agencies were still collecting data on using the vaccines in children younger than 12, and that he hoped the F.D.A. could at least authorize the vaccines for emergency use in children by early winter.",
      "Speaking on \u201cThe Today Show\u201d on NBC, Dr. Fauci said he thought that ending the pandemic in the United States would involve convincing the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of unvaccinated people to be inoculated.",
      "\u201cI believe we can see light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d Dr. Fauci said. \u201cWhen we reach a point where there\u2019s enough of a veil of protection over the community that you see a dramatic diminution not only in cases, but in hospitalizations and, ultimately of course, in deaths.\u201d"

    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Biden, his aides and his allies in Congress face a September sprint to secure a legislative victory that could define his early presidency.",
      "Democrats are racing the clock after party leaders in the House struck a deal this week to advance the two-track approach that Mr. Biden hopes will deliver a $4 trillion overhaul of the federal government\u2019s role in the economy. That agreement sets up a potentially perilous vote on one part of the agenda by Sept. 27: a bipartisan deal on roads, broadband, water pipes and other physical infrastructure. It also spurred House and Senate leaders to intensify efforts to complete a larger, Democrats-only bill to fight climate change, expand educational access and invest heavily in workers and families, inside that same window.",
      "If the party\u2019s factions can bridge their differences in time, they could deliver a signature legislative achievement for Mr. Biden, on par with the New Deal or Great Society, and fund dozens of programs for Democratic candidates and the president to campaign on in the months to come.",
      "If they fail, Mr. Biden could find both halves of his economic agenda dashed, at a time when his popularity is slumping and few if any of his other top priorities have a chance to pass Congress.",
      "The president finds himself at a perilous moment seven months into his term. His withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan has devolved into a chaotic race to evacuate tens of thousands of people from the country by the month\u2019s end. After throwing a July 4 party at the White House to \u201cdeclare independence\u201d from the coronavirus pandemic, he has seen the Delta variant rampage through unvaccinated populations and send hospitalizations and death rates from the virus soaring in states like Florida.",
      "Mr. Biden\u2019s approval ratings have dipped in recent months, even on an issue that has been an early strength of his tenure: the economy, where some recent polls show more voters disapproving of his performance than approving it.",
      "The country is enjoying what will most likely be its strongest year of economic growth in a quarter century. But consumer confidence has slumped in the face of rapidly rising prices for food, gasoline and used cars, along with shortages of home appliances, medical devices and other products stemming from pandemic-fueled disruptions in the global supply chain.",
      "While unemployment has fallen to 5.4 percent, workers have not flocked back to open jobs as quickly as many economists had hoped, creating long waits in restaurants and elsewhere. Private forecasters have marked down their expectations for growth in the back half of the year, citing supply constraints and the threat from the Delta variant.",
      "White House economists still expect strong job gains through the rest of the year and a headline growth rate that far exceeds what any forecasters expected at the start of 2021, before Mr. Biden steered a $1.9 trillion stimulus plan through Congress. But the White House economic team has lowered informal internal forecasts for growth this year, citing supply constraints and possible consumer response to the renewed spread of the virus, a senior administration official said this week.",
      "Mindful of that markdown, and of what White House economists estimate will be a hefty drag on economic growth next year as stimulus spending dries up, administration officials have mounted a multiweek blitz to pressure congressional moderates and progressives to pass the spending bills that officials say could help reinvigorate the recovery \u2014 and possibly change the narrative of the president\u2019s difficult late summer.",
      "The importance of the package to Mr. Biden was clear on Tuesday, when he pre-empted a speech on evacuation efforts in Afghanistan to laud House passage of a measure that paves the way for a series of votes on his broader agenda.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a step closer to truly investing in the American people, positioning our economy for long-term growth, and building an America that outcompetes the rest of the world,\u201d the president said.",
      "Many steps remain before Mr. Biden can sign both bills into law \u2014 but his party has given itself only a few weeks to complete them. The infrastructure bill is written. But the House and Senate must agree on the spending programs, revenue increases and overall cost of the larger bill, balancing the desires of progressives who see a generational chance to expand government to address inequality and curb climate change and moderates who have pushed for a smaller package and resisted some of the tax proposals to pay for it.",
      "It is a timeline reminiscent of what Republicans set for themselves in the fall of 2017, when they rushed a nearly $2 trillion package of tax cuts to President Donald J. Trump\u2019s desk without a single Democratic vote.",
      "Sticking to it will require sustained support from administration officials both in and out of Washington. In the first three weeks of August, Mr. Biden dispatched cabinet members to 31 states to barnstorm for the infrastructure bill and his broader economic agenda, with events in the districts of moderate and progressive members of Congress, according to internal documents obtained by The New York Times. His secretaries of transportation, labor, interior, energy, commerce and agriculture sat for dozens of local television and radio interviews to promote the bills.",
      "Even with those efforts, the initial clash over advancing the budget this week was resolved with a flurry of calls from Mr. Biden, top White House officials and senior Democrats to the competing factions in the House.",
      "Congressional leaders say they have spent months laying the groundwork so that their party can move quickly toward consensus. Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California told colleagues in a letter on Wednesday that \u201cwe have long had an eye to having the infrastructure bill on the president\u2019s desk by the Oct. 1,\u201d the date when many provisions in the bipartisan package are slated to go into effect.",
      "Committee leaders have been instructed to finish their work by Sept. 15, and rank-and-file lawmakers have been told to make their concerns and priorities known quickly as they maneuver through substantive policy disagreements, including whether it should be as much as $3.5 trillion and the scope of Mr. Biden\u2019s proposed tax increases.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure everybody\u2019s going to try their best,\u201d said Representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky, the House Budget Committee chairman. \u201cSome committees will have it rougher than others.\u201d",
      "Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has been releasing discussion drafts of proposals to fund the $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation spending \u2014 the larger bill that Democrats plan to move without any Republican support \u2014 including raising taxes on high earners and businesses. On Wednesday, he provided granular details of a plan to increase taxes on the profits that multinational companies earn and book overseas.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m encouraged by where we are,\u201d Mr. Wyden said in an interview.",
      "Democratic leaders and the White House have pushed analyses of their proposals that speak to core liberal priorities; on Wednesday, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, released a report suggesting the two bills combined would \u201cput our country on the path to meet President Biden\u2019s climate change goals of 80 percent clean electricity and 50 percent economywide carbon emission reduction by 2030.\u201d",
      "White House economists released a detailed report this week claiming the spending Mr. Biden supports, like universal prekindergarten and subsidized child care, would expand the productive capacity of the economy and help reduce price pressures in the future.",
      "While Republicans are not expected to get on board with the larger spending bill, they are still making their concerns known, labeling the bill socialist and a spending spree and claiming it will stoke inflation and drive jobs overseas.",
      "Mr. Biden can pass the entire agenda now with only Democratic votes, but the party\u2019s thin majorities \u2014 including no room for even a single defection in the Senate \u2014 complicates the task. Ms. Pelosi said on Wednesday that the House would \u201cwrite a bill with the Senate, because there\u2019s no use our doing a bill that is not going to pass the Senate, in the interest of getting things done.\u201d",
      "As part of an agreement to secure the votes needed to approve the $3.5 trillion budget blueprint on Tuesday, Ms. Pelosi gave centrist and conservative Democrats a commitment that she would only take up a reconciliation package that had the support of all 50 Senate Democrats and cleared the strict Senate rules that govern the fast-track process.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not here to pass messaging bills \u2014 I\u2019m here to pass bills that will actually become law and help the American people,\u201d said Representative Stephanie Murphy of Florida, one of the Democrats who initially announced that she would not support advancing the budget, but ultimately joined every Democrat in advancing it.",
      "For moderates, Ms. Pelosi\u2019s commitment served to shield them from potentially tough votes on provisions that the Senate may reject. It also signaled the political realities that could shape the final legislation. No Democrat will want to vote on a large spending bill doomed for failure. It will be Mr. Biden\u2019s job to lead his coalition to a bill that can pass muster with moderates and progressives alike \u2014 and to convince every holdout that failure is not an option."

      "The House voted on Tuesday to restore federal oversight of state election laws, beginning a push by Democrats to strengthen the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 amid a national fight over access to the ballot box.",
      "The legislation, named after the late civil rights icon Representative John Lewis of Georgia, is a linchpin in Democrats\u2019 strategy to combat voting restrictions in Republican-led states. It would reverse two Supreme Court rulings that gutted the statute, reviving the power of the Justice Department to bar some discriminatory election changes from taking effect and easing the path to challenging others in court.",
      "Up against urgent deadlines ahead of next year\u2019s midterm elections, Democrats adopted the measure 219 to 212 along party lines during a rare August session, just days after the bill was introduced. But stiff Republican opposition awaits in the Senate, where a likely filibuster threatens to sink the bill before it can reach President Biden\u2019s desk.",
      "That outcome is becoming familiar this summer, as Democrats on Capitol Hill try to use their party\u2019s control of Congress and the White House to lock in watershed election changes \u2014 only to be blocked by their Republican counterparts. In the meantime, more than a dozen G.O.P.-led states have already enacted more than 30 laws making it harder to cast votes.",
      "Frustration with that dynamic has fueled increasingly desperate calls from progressives and many mainstream Democrats to invoke the so-called nuclear option and eliminate the 60-vote filibuster threshold in the Senate. Doing so would allow Democrats to move unilaterally without Republican support, but any rules change would require support from all 50 Democrats in the chamber, and key moderates oppose doing so.",
      "During the debate before Tuesday\u2019s vote, proponents of the bill, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, framed it as a vital complement to Democrats\u2019 other major elections bill, the For the People Act. Even more ambitious, that legislation would set new national standards making it easier to vote, end partisan gerrymandering and combat dark money.",
      "\u201cOld battles have indeed become new again,\u201d said Representative Terri Sewell of Alabama, the Democrat who represents Selma and wrote the bill. \u201cWhile literacy tests and poll taxes no longer exist, certain states and local jurisdictions have passed laws that are modern-day barriers to voting.\u201d",
      "",
      "Lawmakers drafted the Voting Rights Act fix to respond directly to a pair of Supreme Court rulings in which a conservative majority invalidated or weakened key portions of the statute.",
      "The first came in 2013, when the justices in the case of Shelby County v. Holder effectively struck down a provision requiring states and jurisdictions with a history of discriminatory voting practices to receive advance approval from the federal government for any changes to their election rules.",
      "The court specifically ruled that the formula used to determine which entities should be subject to such requirements was outdated, and said Congress would have to update it for it to be constitutional. The bill being debated on Tuesday proposes an updated and expanded coverage plan.",
      "The legislation also attempts to overturn a Supreme Court decision last month in Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee that took aim at a separate section of the statute and made it harder to successfully challenge voting changes as discriminatory in court.",
      "Republicans enthusiastically supported expansions of the Voting Rights Act in the past. But since the court\u2019s 2013 decision, they have shown little appetite to revive the portions of the statute that were struck down, arguing that the kind of race-based discrimination that the law was originally designed to fight no longer exists.",
      "During the debate, Representative Rodney Davis, Republican of Illinois, cited statistics showing record turnout among Black voters during the 2020 election, a far cry from the small percentages that were able to vote in many Southern states the 1960s.",
      "\u201cNot only is our country not facing a new era of Jim Crow voting laws, as many of my Democrat colleagues have claimed, it is incredibly offensive to lie to the American people to advance a political agenda,\u201d Mr. Davis said.",
      "\u201cWe should celebrate this progress, not ignore it,\u201d he added."

    "title": "F.D.A., Not F.D.R.",
    "content": [
      "The F.D.A.\u2019s full approval of Pfizer\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine is already making a difference. Within hours of the announcement yesterday, the Pentagon and several large companies and universities announced new vaccine mandates. President Biden, speaking at the White House yesterday afternoon, urged other organizations to follow: \u201cRequire your employees to get vaccinated or face strict requirements,\u201d he said.",
      "But the much-celebrated impact of the F.D.A.\u2019s decision has a flip side: The monthslong wait to reach this point has had large costs.",
      "It has delayed the hundreds of thousands of vaccinations that will now occur within the military and elsewhere. The lack of full approval has meant that some Americans who are skeptical of vaccination \u2014 but not firmly opposed to it \u2014 still have not gotten a shot, fueling the spread of the Delta variant and causing many unnecessary deaths. (These maps show that vaccination rates for people over age 65 are much lower in the U.S. than in Britain.)",
      "Over the past week, about 1,000 Americans per day have died of Covid; vaccination would probably have saved more than 95 percent of them.",
      "Why, then, has the F.D.A. been so slow to act?",
      "The short answer is bureaucratic caution. The F.D.A.\u2019s leaders wanted to hew as closely as possible to their normal process for granting full approval to a vaccine. They bestowed \u201cemergency authorization\u201d on the Covid vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson months ago, so that Americans could begin receiving shots. In the meantime, the F.D.A. spent months reviewing trial results before granting full approval to any Covid vaccine.",
      "F.D.A. officials have defended this approach by pointing out \u2014 fairly \u2014 that a careful approval process can increase people\u2019s confidence in a vaccine. But officials have also claimed that they had little choice but to follow the cautious path that they did. And that part of their defense is inconsistent with the facts.",
      "There are two basic ways to see that the F.D.A. did have a choice and could have acted more quickly than it did. The first is that the agency has acknowledged that it moved more quickly in this case than it normally does. A typical vaccine approval process takes between eight and 12 months; Pfizer\u2019s Covid vaccine received full approval three and a half months after the company filed its application.",
      "There is nothing magical about three and a half months, however. Once the F.D.A. had already departed from its usual process, it could have done so more aggressively than it did. Multiple medical experts have been urging so for months. No White House official, member of Congress or federal judge was threatening to stand in the way of an expedited process.",
      "After all, the F.D.A. leaders made clear that they had made up their minds long ago about the substantive part of the decision to grant full approval. They publicly endorsed the vaccines, urging Americans to get shots. Dr. Janet Woodcock, the acting commissioner, said three months ago that the vaccines \u201chave met our high standards for quality, safety and effectiveness.\u201d Early last month, Dr. Peter Marks, who oversees the approval process, wrote, \u201cIf we truly want our lives to return to normal, the fastest way to do so is simple \u2014 get vaccinated right now.\u201d",
      "The wait for full approval, then, was more about process than science.",
      "The second key point is that American history is rich with examples of government officials doing what the F.D.A. decided not to do in this case: overhaul their process in a time of crisis.",
      "Franklin D. Roosevelt repeatedly broke with tradition \u2014 and endured confrontation with the courts \u2014 to fight the Great Depression. His administration, working closely with business, also threw out the normal bureaucratic procedures to build World War II ships, planes, tanks, bombs and other mat\u00e9riel with stunning speed. In this century, the Federal Reserve under Ben Bernanke took creative risks that helped keep the financial crisis of 2007-9 from becoming another Great Depression. (The title of Bernanke\u2019s memoir is telling: \u201cThe Courage to Act.\u201d)",
      "In each of the instances, officials avoided taking steps that clearly violated the law. Yet they recognized that the law often includes gray areas and gives government agencies leeway to choose one of several approaches. During normal times, taking the cautious route and following procedural precedent tends to make sense. It minimizes chaos and mistakes.",
      "But a national emergency can change the equation. In an emergency \u2014 like a depression, a war or a pandemic \u2014 government leaders will sometimes decide that the abstract benefits of bureaucratic continuity are smaller than the concrete benefits of preventing a depression, winning a war or saving lives. These leaders refuse to be bound by precedent.",
      "In 1932, Roosevelt described his approach as: \u201cAbove all, try something.\u201d In 2021, the F.D.A. took a different approach.",

      "When I think about growing up in Nashville in the 1980s, three memories jump out. The first is that my father, who grew up there in the 1950s, liked to say how little had changed \u2014 the streets, the people, the way everything shut down at 6 p.m. The second is that my mother, who came from Louisville, felt constantly demeaned as an outsider, Kentucky being too far north for many people\u2019s comfort. And the third is McPizza \u2014 Nashville was considered a synecdoche of the American average, and therefore an early test market. If a McDonald\u2019s pizza could sell there, it would sell anywhere. (Spoiler: It didn\u2019t.)",

At its top sat what locals called good ol\u2019 boys and what the historian Patrick Wyman calls the \u201cAmerican gentry\u201d \u2014 millionaires but not billionaires, all of them white men, conservative but not particularly ideological, with fortunes built more on static sectors like agriculture and services than on tech or finance. Most of the elite were happy to keep the city just as it was. They looked at Atlanta\u2019s rapid postwar expansion in horror, and they militated against anything \u2014 mass transit, downtown development \u2014 that might turn us into another Southern megalopolis.",
      "Then, around the time I left in 1995, things started to change. A series of liberal, pro-growth mayors, starting with Phil Bredesen, began to draw in global business. Dell built a plant there, then Nissan brought its North American headquarters to a suburb. They built out amenities: sports arenas, a world-class symphony hall. And they added new infrastructure, such as commuter rail and better buses.",
      "The results are obvious to anyone who has hopped a flight for a weekend of Music City, U.S.A., which within the last decade has claimed the crown of America\u2019s \u201cit\u201d city. A downtown with seemingly more construction cranes than mid-\u201990s Berlin. A metropolitan area that has doubled in size, to about two million people. A tourist mecca, drawing 15.2 million visitors in 2018 \u2014 versus just two million in 1998. The No. 1 bachelorette party destination in the country.",
      "It\u2019s not just about tourism. Vanderbilt, always a good regional school, is now one of the wealthiest, most exclusive universities in the country. AllianceBernstein moved its headquarters to Nashville in 2018; both Amazon and Oracle are now building multi-billion-dollar campuses in and around downtown.",
      "You won\u2019t necessarily notice it from your pedal tavern or Salemtown Airbnb, but all of this change has done a number on the city\u2019s politics, in a way that is instructive for how once-insular cities are changing in the face of huge inflows of population from the coasts. The challenge is not so much managing growth \u2014 it\u2019s managing the political change that growth brings.",
      "Instead of one power center, the gentry, there are now three. The first newcomer is a liberal elite that, like its parallel at the national level, manages to be both left-leaning and pro-business. It embraces things like L.G.B.T.Q. awareness and smart-growth policies. It welcomes Amazon, but it also wants to see the tax revenues it will bring used for things like mass transit, affordable housing and education. It wants to be a top-tier city like Atlanta, but in the right way.",
      "In sharp contrast is a coalition of local business people, Trumpist ideologues and religious conservatives, united by an opposition to the left and the sort of activist government it espouses. These folks have been around for decades: Phil Valentine, the Nashville radio host who died last week of Covid, made his name in the 1990s opposing immigration and tax increases. But they have been emboldened by the influx of tourist dollars over the past 20 years, which has lined the pockets of developers and entertainment entrepreneurs who see any effort at regulation as a threat to their livelihood.",
      "And although the members of the gentry don\u2019t have quite the sway they once did, they still have some power. Mayor John Cooper, a developer who defeated a progressive in 2019, came into office promising little more than a return to the status quo ante. His brother, Jim Cooper, is the city\u2019s representative in the U.S. House.",
      "For over 20 years, Nashville was led by a loose alliance of pro-business liberals and the gentry, which kept the anti-tax conservative right at bay. The gentry weren\u2019t necessarily pro-growth, but as long as it was well-managed and to their benefit, they went along. That all fell apart in 2018, when Mayor Megan Barry, a liberal, resigned amid a sex scandal. She had been the driving force behind a billion-dollar plan to upgrade the city\u2019s transit infrastructure, which had the gentry\u2019s approval but faced fierce opposition from the ideological right (backed by money from the Koch brothers\u2019 Americans for Prosperity). Her fall not only doomed the plan, but also sundered public faith in the liberal-gentry alliance.",
      "Absent that leadership, Nashville, which just a few years ago felt like a promised land for folks fleeing big-city problems, faces several challenges of its own. First is affordability. Housing prices are shooting up, squeezing out the working class. Unregulated, developers are replacing entire neighborhoods with McMansions and short-term rentals. As people are pushed to the edges and beyond, commuting is becoming unbearable.",
      "Second is the culture clash between progressives and Trumpists. School board meetings over mask mandates have turned into fist fights, instigated in part by right-wing provocateurs. Nashville is the capital of Tennessee, which makes it home to battles over red-state concerns like transgender rights and Confederate monuments. These conflicts may be easy to dismiss as sideshows, but left unresolved they can poison the sort of consensus-building that long-term planning requires.",
      "Third is the city\u2019s budget, and the leadership\u2019s failure to take advantage of its good fortune. In a state with no income tax, local property taxes are vital sources of government revenue. Yet Nashville has repeatedly rejected efforts to keep them in line with rising valuations. That has meant cuts to education, public works and infrastructure, and foreclosed the possibility of big-idea plans that may carry the city forward (though the City Council did vote recently to increase teacher pay).",
      "Taken together, these problems represent a fundamental challenge to the gentry\u2019s leadership, even as they make it harder to see either of the other factions taking hold. Liberals are ascendant, with President Biden capturing the highest percentage of the city\u2019s votes since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944. But the left is unlikely to take a commanding role over a city that covers 526 square miles, much of it exurban or rural, a metropolitan structure that was, ironically, one of the great achievements of the city\u2019s last liberal-gentry alliance, in the 1960s. And there is an ascendant populist left, including a serious primary opponent for Jim Cooper next year, that is challenging the historical pro-business orientation among liberals.",
      "But there are enough people on the left, however fractious, to offset the populist right, which, despite the arrival of national mascots like Candace Owens, Ben Shapiro and Tomi Lahren \u2014 all of whom relocated to Nashville in recent years \u2014 represents a rowdy, disjointed minority. They may have allies among some of the ideologically oriented business elite, but the gentry won\u2019t touch them, and their boisterous divisiveness makes them a hard sell among Nashville\u2019s moderate middle.",
      "The result is chaos. A city that has so much going for it \u2014 tourism, tech and finance relocation, millions of young, educated migrants \u2014 is fatally hamstrung by a political leadership that has lost control but can\u2019t yet cede power to a successor. In its absence, growth will continue; Nashville is still a fun, relatively affordable place to live. But that growth will be unguided and metastatic. In other words, it will be Atlanta \u2014 the very thing that the gentry wished so hard to avoid emulating.",
      "And this isn\u2019t just about Nashville. Again, it\u2019s about McPizza. Nashville is a canary, a test case, a harbinger. A reminder that growth, without smart, unified leadership, can do much more harm than good.",
      "Eric Coomer had an election-security job at Dominion Voting Systems. He also had posted anti-Trump messages on Facebook.",
      "Then he found himself at the center of an ever-expanding conspiracy theory about the election \u2014 with no end in sight.",
      "In The New York Times Magazine this week, the writer Susan Dominus explores how Mr. Coomer inadvertently gave these pro-Trump conspiracy theorists \u201ca valuable resource, a grain of sand they could transform into something that had the feel \u2014 the false promise \u2014 of proof.\u201d",

      "The top Republican in the Pennsylvania State Senate promised this week to carry out a broad review of the 2020 election results, a move that comes as G.O.P. lawmakers continue to sow doubts about the contest\u2019s legitimacy by pushing to re-examine votes in battleground states like Arizona.",
      "State Senator Jake Corman, who serves as president pro tempore of the G.O.P.-controlled chamber, made the comments in an interview with a right-wing radio host, and they were first reported by The Philadelphia Inquirer on Tuesday. His remarks were the strongest sign yet that Pennsylvania \u2014 which President Biden won by more than 80,000 votes \u2014 may press forward with a review of 2020 results, despite no evidence of voter fraud that would have affected the outcome.",
      "In the interview, Mr. Corman said that he wanted to begin \u201calmost immediately\u201d and that hearings would begin this week. He added that he expected to use the full power of the state\u2019s General Assembly, including subpoenas, to conduct the review, which he referred to as a \u201cforensic investigation.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe can bring people in, we can put them under oath, we can subpoena records, and that\u2019s what we need to do and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d Mr. Corman said. \u201cAnd so we\u2019re going to move forward.\u201d",
      "Previously, State Senator Doug Mastriano, a Republican and vocal proponent of former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s falsehoods about the election, had called for a review of results in three counties.",
      "Until recently the chair of the Senate Intergovernmental Operations Committee, he sent letters requesting ballots, records and machines from Philadelphia County, which encompasses the state\u2019s largest city and which Mr. Biden won with over 80 percent of the vote; York County, south of Harrisburg, which Mr. Trump won handily; and Tioga County, in the northern part of the state, which Mr. Trump also carried with ease. All three counties refused to comply, and Mr. Mastriano\u2019s legal authority to enforce the requests remains unclear.",
      "Last week, Mr. Corman removed Mr. Mastriano from his position as chair of the committee and installed State Senator Cris Dush, also a Republican, to lead the panel and oversee the review.",
      "In the interview, Mr. Corman expressed his own doubts about the election.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily have faith in the results,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that there were many problems in our election that we need to get to the bottom of.\u201d",
      "Jason Thompson, a spokesman for Mr. Corman, said that they were \u201cnot setting a hard cap on how long the audit will take,\u201d but that he could not comment further because \u201cmany of the details of the audit plan are still being worked out, and Senator Dush will need a little more time to settle on the final approach.\u201d",
      "Veronica Degraffenreid, who as the acting secretary of the commonwealth oversees Pennsylvania\u2019s elections, has discouraged counties from participating in any election reviews, noting that any inspection of voting machines by uncredentialed third parties would result in their decertification, and that counties would have to bear the considerable costs of replacing the equipment.",
      "\u201cThe Department of State encourages counties to refuse to participate in any sham review of past elections that would require counties to violate the trust of their voters and ignore their statutory duty to protect the chain of custody of their ballots and voting equipment,\u201d Ms. Degraffenreid\u2019s office said in a statement last month.",
      "It remains unclear exactly how Mr. Corman and the Pennsylvania Senate will proceed with their review, including what they might seek in terms of equipment and records, and which counties they might focus on. Mr. Corman did say that, after talking with fellow legislators in Arizona, he was looking for a \u201cneutral arbiter\u201d to help carry out the review \u2014 a potential nod to how the Maricopa County review became widely ridiculed in part because the chief executive of the company carrying out the re-examination had promoted conspiracy theories about rigged voting machines costing Mr. Trump victory in the state.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s important that we get people involved that don\u2019t have ties to anybody, that are professional, that will do the job so that we can stand behind the results,\u201d Mr. Corman said."

      "\u201cThe Delta variant is much more contagious than previous variants we\u2019ve seen, and it has dramatically increased the amount of virus in our communities,\u201d Ms. Brown said in a statement. \u201cMasks have proven to be effective at bringing case counts down, and are a necessary measure right now, even in some outdoor settings, to help fight Covid and protect one another.\u201d",
      "Oregon is the first state to reintroduce an outdoor mask mandate for both vaccinated and unvaccinated people since the Delta-driven surge took hold in the early summer, and among a handful to reimpose an indoor mask requirement statewide.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The C.I.A. director, William J. Burns, traveled to Kabul for talks with the Taliban leadership, American officials familiar with his visit said on Tuesday, conducting the administration\u2019s highest-level in-person talks so far with the new de facto leaders of Afghanistan.",
      "Mr. Burns, a former longtime diplomat who is the Biden administration\u2019s most experienced back-channel negotiator, met on Monday with Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Taliban leader who had led diplomatic negotiations in Qatar with the U.S. government that began during the Trump administration.",
      "While American officials would not provide details of the brief trip, they said Mr. Burns was not there to negotiate an extension of President Biden\u2019s planned Aug. 31 troop withdrawal. Indeed, after Mr. Burns departed, the Taliban announced they would reject any postponement of the American military\u2019s departure, and Mr. Biden said he would not seek one, though he left open the possibility of shifting course.",
      "Mr. Burns\u2019s negotiations appeared to be more general, covering the evacuation operations and terrorist threats. American officials need the Taliban to tolerate the evacuation flights and to help stop the Islamic State or others from mounting attacks on Afghan civilians, including any suicide bombings outside the airport, American officials have said.",
      "The Taliban consider the Islamic State\u2019s Afghanistan branch a threat, and the two have fought long battles in recent years. Islamic State leaders have criticized the Taliban leadership as overly moderate.",
      "The Taliban have an incentive to cooperate. They want to secure international legitimacy and to try to avoid the isolation they experienced in the 1990s, when they were last in power. Taliban leaders have urged international governments to maintain their embassies in Afghanistan.",
      "The United States sent thousands of troops to secure the airport, and the pace of evacuations has stepped up in recent days. But getting Afghans from their homes to the airport in Kabul safely has become more difficult and dangerous, and the Taliban said on Tuesday that they would no longer allow Afghans to leave.",
      "Former officials have said that the United States will need more time, perhaps until late September, to try to ferry out Afghans who have applied for special visas from the United States.",
      "The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, declined to discuss Mr. Burns\u2019s visit but noted the administration had acknowledged it was \u201cin regular contact with the Taliban.\u201d The C.I.A. and the National Security Council declined to comment on Mr. Burns\u2019s trip, which was reported earlier by The Washington Post.",
      "Mr. Burns, who titled his memoir \u201cThe Back Channel,\u201d specialized in delicate, secret communications during his long State Department career. A former ambassador to Russia and Jordan who rose to the department\u2019s No. 3 post during the Obama administration, he was responsible for the initial undisclosed discussions that ultimately led to the Iran nuclear talks in the Obama administration.",
      "When Mr. Burns was chosen to run the C.I.A., officials in the incoming administration said he would act as a traditional intelligence chief assessing threats, not take on his old work as a diplomat. But the State Department tapped him as the Biden administration faces its gravest national security and foreign policy crisis.",
      "Dispatching Mr. Burns also fit because with the fall of the Afghan government and the withdrawal of American diplomats and troops, the C.I.A. will bear much of the responsibility for monitoring Afghanistan going forward.",
      "The visit was Mr. Burns\u2019s second to Kabul this year. In April, as concerns mounted about the Afghan government\u2019s ability to effectively fight the Taliban, Mr. Burns met there with Afghan intelligence officials.",
      "While ultimate power in Afghanistan most likely rests with the Taliban\u2019s supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, Mr. Baradar has led negotiations with the West.",
      "Mr. Baradar, a top Taliban leader since the group was formed, has a reputation as both a shrewd, battle-hardened military commander and a polished political operator and administrator. He has also long been seen as the Taliban leader least likely to take a hard line on either the group\u2019s harsh moral code or its relations with the rest of the world.",
      "Mr. Baradar, thought to have been born in 1968, is now the Taliban\u2019s political leader, but even that description only hints at his stature. He fought the Soviets in the 1980s alongside Mohammed Omar, they were co-founders of the Taliban in 1994, and for 15 years he served as chief deputy to Mullah Omar, the Taliban leader.",
      "While the Taliban were in power from 1996 to 2001, Mr. Baradar served as a provincial governor and deputy military chief. After they were ousted by the U.S.-led invasion in 2001 and the Taliban leadership took refuge in Pakistan, Western officials say, it was Mr. Baradar, rather than the reclusive Mullah Omar, who mostly ran day-to-day operations, convening leadership and military councils, meeting with the Taliban\u2019s shadow governors, overseeing finances and often directing ruthless insurgent operations in Afghanistan.",
      "In 2009, Mr. Baradar reached out to the Afghan government to explore peace talks, but the Pakistani authorities arrested him in early 2010 and held him for more than eight years.",
      "Pakistan was the Taliban\u2019s chief sponsor and the Americans had long accused Pakistan of sheltering them, so the arrests of Mr. Baradar and other Taliban leaders came as a surprise. But it soon emerged that the Pakistanis, fearing a loss of influence in Afghanistan, wanted to sabotage prospects for a brokered end to the war.",
      "With Mr. Baradar out of the picture, the nascent talks collapsed. Kai Eide, a former United Nations envoy to Afghanistan, later said, \u201cI believe that he was already, before his arrest, the most prominent Taliban leader in favor of finding a political settlement.\u201d",
      "In his absence, other Taliban leaders rose to prominence and Mr. Baradar\u2019s longtime ally and mentor, Mullah Omar, died.",
      "In 2018, under pressure from the United States, Pakistan released Mr. Baradar and he quickly became the Taliban\u2019s chief negotiator in talks with the United States held in Doha, Qatar.",
      "When those talks produced the February 2020 agreement for American troops to withdraw, Mr. Baradar signed on behalf of the Taliban. A few days later, he spoke with Donald J. Trump \u2014 the first conversation between a U.S. president and a Taliban leader."

      "As she flew about 1,500 feet above the Denmark Strait, staying low to dodge clouds, she listened to a podcast in which a YouTube celebrity argued that the only certainty in life is death.",
      "\u201cI was like, well, that\u2019s kind of what I\u2019m anxious about,\u201d Ms. Rutherford said. \u201cThat was quite funny and it made me laugh. If only she knew!\u201d",
      "Ms. Rutherford, who is Belgian and British, began her journey in Europe last week and entered United States airspace on Thursday morning. She plans to return to Belgium on Nov. 3 after soaring over 52 countries on five continents.",
      "If she does, she would overtake Shaesta Waiz to become the youngest woman to circumnavigate the globe solo in a single-engine aircraft. (Travis Ludlow, an aviator from Britain, did so in July at the age of 18.)",
      "Two months ago, Ms. Rutherford emailed Ms. Waiz, 34, who completed the journey in 2017, to ask if it was OK to challenge her record. The answer was an enthusiastic yes.",
      "\u201cI told her that I\u2019m so proud of her for being so brave \u2014 and so young \u2014 to do this,\u201d Ms. Waiz said. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing with records: They\u2019re meant to be broken.\u201d",
      "Ms. Rutherford said that she saw her own journey not only as a personal challenge, but also as a means of raising awareness about the gender gap in fields like aviation, science, technology, engineering and mathematics.",
      "During the trip, she has been using social media to highlight the stories of notable women in aviation and other fields. Her list includes Bessie Coleman, the first African American woman in the United States to earn a pilot\u2019s license, and Lilian Bland, a British aviation pioneer who is thought to be the first woman to design, build and fly her own plane.",
      "After Ms. Rutherford arrived in Iceland last week, she met the country\u2019s 30-year-old justice minister, Aslaug Arna Sigurbjornsdottir, in an airport hangar. \u201cSuch a great example for women, to see that we are capable of so much more than we sometimes think, believe or dream!\u201d Ms. Rutherford wrote on Facebook.",
      "As a child, Ms. Rutherford said, she did not have many female role models. People would tell her about Amelia Earhart, the American aviator who vanished in 1937 during a voyage around the world. \u201cBut as an 8- or 9-year-old,\u201d Ms. Rutherford added, \u201cit\u2019s not someone you really know or look up to.\u201d",
      "She found other role models closer to home. Her mother, Beatrice De Smet, is a recreational pilot, and her father, Sam Rutherford, is a professional one who transports aircraft around the world for clients. She has been accompanying him for years, sometimes flying part of the way herself.",
      "Her longest journey until now was from Texas to Jordan. \u201cWell, it was meant to be from Texas to India, but I had to go back to school,\u201d she said with a laugh in a telephone interview from Greenland.",
      "This time crossing the Atlantic is only the start. She landed in New York City on Thursday afternoon. After she takes off again on Sunday, she will hug the east coast of the United States before dipping down to Colombia via the British Virgin Islands. Then she will head across Mexico, up the west coast of California and north to Alaska, after a detour to Montana.",
      "After crossing into Russia over the Bering Strait, she will fly over China, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia, before looping back to Europe. She said the only country that she intentionally avoided was North Korea.",
      "The route is almost comically squiggly, in part, she said, because her two-seater plane is unable to fly long distances over oceans, but also because she likes the idea of a grand adventure.",
      "\u201cI could have shortened it, but I feel like that would have been quite boring,\u201d she said.",
      "Sponsors and airports are picking up the cost of the trip, and a company in Slovakia, Shark Aero, is providing her with the aircraft. She also has a support staff to arrange landing rights and other logistics, and her father has been advising her from the ground on technical specifics.",
      "After her radio cut out during the journey to Greenland, for example, he asked in a text message if she was able to climb through holes in the clouds to an altitude where the visibility would be better.",
      "Michael Fabry, a ferry pilot who lives in Belgium and happened to fly about 10,500 feet above Ms. Rutherford during part of her Iceland-to-Greenland leg, said that she would benefit enormously from having a support crew to help with logistics, particularly in Asia and the Middle East.",
      "But she will inevitably encounter stiff winds, he added, as well as clouds that she cannot fly through because her plane is not certified to fly on instruments alone.",
      "\u201cThat means she has to fly very low, and very low is not a safe condition to be in if you\u2019re over water,\u201d Mr. Fabry, a former commercial pilot, said by telephone.",
      "\u201cShe does have a bit of experience, but what she\u2019s doing is really, really, really brave, I have to say,\u201d he added. \u201cI am a little bit worried. I\u2019m sure the rest of the world is also worried.\u201d",
      "Ms. Rutherford said that she was under pressure to reach Russia by late September to avoid the onset of bad weather, and that safety was her priority. Before she left, she practiced escaping from a plane in an underwater simulator.",
      "She finds flying over water stressful, she said, and listens to podcasts to calm her nerves. When she made a windy landing in Greenland last week after going without radio contact for most of the three-hour flight from Iceland, she sent her parents a two-word text message: \u201cI\u2019m alive.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was a really long flight. I\u2019m really happy to be on the ground, to be honest,\u201d she said in an Instagram video, adding that at one point the low cloud cover had forced her to fly at just 600 feet above the ocean.",
      "She was delayed for two days in Greenland \u2014 where she hung out with some NASA scientists \u2014 because of bad weather. But on Monday she completed her trans-Atlantic crossing by landing in Goose Bay, Canada. Fire trucks on the tarmac welcomed her with a water cannon salute.",
      "On Thursday, Ms. Rutherford took off in Montreal and landed at New York\u2019s Kennedy International Airport, a rare destination for a plane that is only about 22 feet long. (That was her dad\u2019s idea; he thought it would be cool.)",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to be the biggest airfield I will ever land at in my life,\u201d she said ahead of the flight. \u201cSo I\u2019m pretty excited.\u201d"

      "Mr. Rumsfeld died on June 29, at 88, of complications related to multiple myeloma. The date for his interment and an earlier private funeral service on Monday at Fort Myer, Va., had been set long before, but the timing meant that Mr. Rumsfeld was laid to rest during the same kind of shell shock as on Oct. 7, 2001, when the United States launched its first airstrikes in Afghanistan.",
      "And yet, the ceremonies seemed to take place in a contained, parallel universe, sealed off from the strife of Washington. \u201cThis was very much about the man and his times, and not any particular issue of the day,\u201d said Larry Di Rita, a top deputy to Mr. Rumsfeld at the Pentagon during the George W. Bush administration.",
      "Say what you will about the man known as \u201cRummy,\u201d and many have, harshly, for turning away from Afghanistan and waging a war in Iraq that left thousands of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis dead and ultimately wrecked the end of Mr. Rumsfeld\u2019s political life. But at Memorial Chapel at Fort Myer, the eulogists recalled a different man.",
      "\u201cOur capital city has many familiar types,\u201d former Vice President Dick Cheney, Mr. Rumsfeld\u2019s longtime ally, recalled of his closest friend, according to his prepared remarks and confirmed by guests at the funeral. \u201cYet in all my years around this company town, I have never heard anyone described as \u2018the Rumsfeld type.\u2019 There is no such thing because nothing about Don was typical or derivative or standard-issue.\u201d",
      "Mr. Cheney also brought up some of Mr. Rumsfeld\u2019s signature maxims, which Mr. Rumsfeld would sometimes adapt from familiar Washington sayings. \u201cHarry Truman supposedly said, \u2018If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog,\u2019\u201d Mr. Cheney said. \u201cTo this, Don added the Rumsfeld corollary: Get a small dog \u2014 he might turn on you.\u201d",
      "The words \u201cAfghanistan\u201d or \u201cIraq\u201d were barely spoken by Mr. Cheney and a procession of other eulogists, among them Richard B. Myers, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the outset of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Victoria Clarke, Mr. Rumsfeld\u2019s longtime communications aide at the Pentagon.",
      "Ms. Clarke invoked one of Mr. Rumsfeld\u2019s favorite sayings, or so-called Rumsfeld Rules. \u201cCemeteries are filled with irreplaceable people,\u201d Ms. Clarke said before the burial, quoting her former boss, but amending the rule in his honor. \u201cArlington National Cemetery will soon have someone who is truly irreplaceable.\u201d",
      "Details of the funeral and burial were closely held by the Rumsfeld family and none were released publicly after it was over. Guests included Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who knelt before Mr. Rumsfeld\u2019s widow, Joyce, who was in a wheelchair, and presented her with the flag from her husband\u2019s coffin.",
      "Others there were Representative Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, and Paul D. Wolfowitz, Mr. Rumsfeld\u2019s No. 2 at the Pentagon who pushed hard for the war in Iraq.",
      "\u201cMostly, it was just a lot of people who hadn\u2019t seen each other in a long time, in some cases since Rumsfeld left the Pentagon,\u2019\u2019 said David Hume Kennerly, the presidential photographer of President Gerald R. Ford\u2019s White House when Mr. Rumsfeld was Mr. Ford\u2019s chief of staff. \u201cAnd there were a lot of stories being shared.\u201d",
      "The stories surfaced in the eulogies, which were often drawn from the inside of the Pentagon, where Mr. Rumsfeld served as defense secretary to Ford in the 1970s and a quarter century later to President George W. Bush.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s 9/11, of course,\u201d Ms. Clarke recalled, when Mr. Rumsfeld left his office to assist rescue crews after a hijacked American Airlines plane crashed into the western side of the Pentagon, killing all 64 people aboard the jet and another 125 inside. \u201cMany of us were in the building trying to figure out what had happened,\u201d Ms. Clarke said. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who went and found out.\u201d",
      "A former Navy pilot, Princeton-educated wrestler and competitive squash player into his 80s, Mr. Rumsfeld\u2019s aggressive style was well established. \u201cHe gave no quarter, and there was often blood at the end of the match,\u201d said Mr. Di Rita, a frequent squash opponent of his boss. \u201cWhen you played with him, it was basically just Don Rumsfeld being Don Rumsfeld.\u201d",
      "Ms. Clarke also told the story of seeing Mr. Rumsfeld walk down to the Pentagon briefing room and pick up a misshapen paper clip he spotted in the hallway. He spent the meeting twisting and reworking the lonely paper clip back into fighting shape.",
      "\u201cGood as new,\u201d he told Ms. Clarke, holding up the paper clip as he left the briefing room.",
      "A few hours later, a document was sent down to Ms. Clarke\u2019s office, held together with that same paper clip. \u201cSaving the taxpayers\u2019 money,\u201d Mr. Rumsfeld scrawled on a yellow Post-it note affixed to the restored object.",
      "Mr. Cheney described the tumultuous period after Richard M. Nixon resigned the presidency in 1974, and Mr. Ford was about to name his own vice president. Mr. Rumsfeld was a finalist for the job, and happened to be at Mr. Cheney\u2019s home in Bethesda, Md., listening on a kitchen radio as the process culminated.",
      "\u201cWe heard news reports describing the scene at the Rockefeller estate,\u201d Mr. Cheney recalled, referring to Mr. Ford\u2019s eventual choice, former New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller. There was a fleet of sedans outside the mansion, Mr. Cheney noted, with family jets primed to fly the Rockefeller entourage to Washington.",
      "\u201cDon laughed at the superior resources Rockefeller brought to the competition,\u201d Cheney remembered. \u201cHe said to me, \u2018Here\u2019s Nelson Rockefeller with planeloads of people flying down from New York, and all I\u2019ve got is you, Cheney.\u2019\u201d",
      "Participants said the assembly erupted into laughter, led by the chuckling Mr. Cheney himself. It took a few seconds for solemnity to be restored. \u201cUntil we meet again, goodbye old friend,\u201d Mr. Cheney said at the close of his remarks, his voice catching, according to a guest, in a rare hint of public emotion.",
      "\u201cI had responsibilities and experiences far beyond anything I could have ever known,\u201d Mr. Cheney said, crediting Mr. Rumsfeld for all of them. \u201cHe decided he could trust me and it changed my life.\u201d",
      "Left unsaid, for better or for worse: It changed history, too."

    "title": "Eager to Shift Narrative, Biden Team Puts Airlift in Historical Context",
    "content": [
      "When President Biden briefly referred to the Berlin airlift \u2014 the operation 73 years ago to feed a city whose access had been choked off by the Soviet Union \u2014 in describing the United States\u2019 evacuation efforts in Afghanistan, he was revealing the inspiration for a broader plan to redeem his messy exit.",
      "After 10 days of missed signals, desperate crowds and violence around Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Mr. Biden and his team are eager to shift the narrative about the chaotic end of America\u2019s longest war.",
      "They have seized on the evacuation of tens of thousands of Americans and Afghans from Kabul as the public relations answer. Jake Sullivan, the president\u2019s national security adviser, said Monday that the scores of rescue flights the United States was initiating each day was likely to be regarded as \u201cone of the largest airlifts in history.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is an enormous, logistical, diplomatic, security, humanitarian undertaking,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no other country in the world who could pull something like this off \u2014 bar none.\u201d",
      "As of Tuesday evening, Mr. Biden said that 12,000 people were evacuated from Kabul during the previous 12 hours, the result of 19 military flights and 31 coalition flights. That brings the total number evacuated since the end of July to 75,900 people, the president said \u2014 well beyond the upper limits of what the Pentagon said was possible only days earlier.",
      "Whether that pace can keep up is unclear \u2014 much depends on getting those with the right passports or visas to Kabul and through the airport gates, amid reports of beatings and long waits in the city\u2019s brutal sun. But in interviews, senior aides indicated that they saw a chance of bringing some order to the chaos \u2014 and with it, a sense that they were regaining some modest control over a government collapse in Kabul they did not see coming until it was already underway.",
      "In the past several days, top administration officials have seized on the airlift as the heart of what they hope is a better story to tell: tens of thousands of people evacuated from Kabul safely, with no fatalities among American troops. They are sending multiple updates to reporters each day showing that the pace of people being flown to safety is accelerating.",
      "In private conversations and in public statements, officials \u2014 including the president himself \u2014 have suggested that the evacuation of American citizens and Afghan allies is likely to rank among the most ambitious such efforts ever. Their hope is that if the history books mark this moment, it will be as evidence of order and operational competence.",
      "On Friday, Mr. Biden described the evacuation as \u201cone of the largest, most difficult airlifts in history,\u201d saying the United States is \u201cthe only country in the world capable of projecting this much power on the far side of the world with this degree of precision.\u201d",
      "By comparison, the undertaking in Kabul does not exactly resemble the Berlin airlift, in which food was flown into West Berlin, rather than people being flown out.",
      "But as a model for humanitarian and political recovery, the rescue operation \u2014 which happened when Mr. Biden was just a child \u2014 is not a bad one. The city of Berlin had been divided between the West and the East since the end of World War II and tensions were growing. When the Soviet Union blocked food, electricity and other resources from reaching West Berlin by land, the United States and Britain took to the skies to carry in material by plane.",
      "The two countries managed to get just shy of 300,000 flights into Berlin over 11 months, from June 24, 1948 to May 11, 1949, and the State Department\u2019s record notes that \u201cat the height of the campaign, one plane landed every 45 seconds at Tempelhof Airport,\u201d until recently Berlin\u2019s main air hub.",
      "Harry S. Truman, the president who directed the now-famous airlift, was re-elected in its midst, though not by much \u2014 something that Mr. Biden must have noticed. But history has been kind, describing the Cold War-era airlift as one of the greatest emergency humanitarian efforts. It helps that the Soviet Union ultimately collapsed, 40 years after the airlift ended, and Germany became both unified and free.",
      "Mr. Biden mentioned the Berlin airlift on Sunday to explain his decision to make use of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, which was created after the Berlin crisis to make sure that commercial planes could be used in times of emergency. It has been invoked only rarely, mostly to move troops to the Persian Gulf. But this is a very different kind of mission.",
      "\u201cThe comparison is largely right,\u201d said Michael Beschloss, the presidential historian, who wrote about the 20th-century effort in his book \u201cThe Conquerors.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn both the Berlin airlift and the effort to bring refugees out of Afghanistan, American humanitarian values and impulses are on big display for the rest of the world,\u201d Mr. Beschloss said. \u201cThe difference between the two is that in 1948, we were flying food and other supplies to Berliners who were endangered by the Soviets to show that America would keep its promise to guarantee freedom in Berlin.\u201d",
      "The Berlin airlift is not the only historical analogy possible. In terms of the number of people evacuated, the bid by Mr. Biden\u2019s administration is likely to exceed many other efforts throughout the 20th century.",
      "In the 1960s, after chaos erupted in Congo after it won its independence from Belgium, the United States Air Force helped move 63,899 passengers and 18,806 tons of cargo to deploy United Nation forces, shuttling troops, refugees and other resources to and from scores of nations.",
      "After the government of the Dominican Republic was overthrown by the military in 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson later ordered an evacuation of Americans and other foreign citizens from the capital. Operation Power Pack moved 12,000 passengers and 17,250 tons of cargo within five days.",
      "When the South Vietnamese government in Saigon fell in 1975, the American military used Operation Frequent Wind to evacuate the Americans and at-risk Vietnamese, flying more than 7,000 people by helicopter from the United States Embassy and other locations. The searing images of the rapid departure in the face of danger would prove to be some of the most memorable of the long war."

      "TAYLORSVILLE, Calif. \u2014 Summers in the tiny towns of Indian Valley did not use to bring megafires. The hottest weeks of the year were for checking cattle, searching for newborn calves, herding the mamas and babies across the fields on horseback. They were for swimming in the creeks of the Feather River amid the cottonwood trees. They were for counting down the days until the Fourth of July rodeo and the Plumas County Fair.",
      "But this summer, the rodeo campgrounds have been covered with the tents of National Guard troops, and the fairgrounds have become the base camp for hundreds of firefighters.",
      "For those residents who have stayed as the Dixie fire has swept across the mountain forests of Northern California for six weeks, hoping to protect their homes and herds and way of life, it is hard to avoid a sense of despair.",
      "\u201cThey just want to let us burn,\u201d said Butch Forcino, repeating a common refrain heard among the valley\u2019s weary residents, who have watched fire crews appear and disappear. He lost his home in Indian Falls to the fire and, like many of those displaced, has been living in a trailer in a friend\u2019s field.",
      "Many of the people who are still hanging on I have known since childhood. This valley has been my family\u2019s home since about 1950, when my grandparents settled near the tiny enclave of Genesee, a former stagecoach stop about five miles from Taylorsville. My grandfather built a racehorse ranch that doubled as a summer camp for children from Hollywood. My mother moved away but returned with me after her divorce, when I was 4.",
      "My aunt, uncle and cousins are now among the dozen or so ranchers who call the valley home. Most have stayed despite evacuation orders, tending to their hundreds of head of cattle even as the largest wildfire burning in the United States bears down.",
      "Some officials have tried to encourage them to leave, saying they put themselves and firefighting crews at risk. But at a time when about 100 large blazes are burning across the West, stretching federal and state resources to the limit, they fear that if they do not protect their homes, no one will.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so daunting when you look at that huge, monster fire,\u201d my aunt, Heather Kingdon, 70, told me when I visited Indian Valley last week to report on the blaze. \u201cBut people don\u2019t understand. This is our livelihood.\u201d",
      "The Dixie fire wiped out the valley\u2019s largest town, Greenville \u2014 whose main street dated back to the California gold rush \u2014 on Aug. 4 after flames jumped a containment line and flew down from the mountainside. Homes in other, smaller communities succumbed in the following weeks.",
      "Now Taylorsville is the largest town left standing here, about 150 miles north of Sacramento, the state\u2019s capital. Its few hundred residents have been winnowed down to a few dozen, as the fire has reduced nearby forests to blackened trunks, and authorities have issued mandatory evacuation orders and set up checkpoints on the roads.",
      "On the covered porch of the town\u2019s only store last week, the few remaining residents stopped to peer at a map showing the fire\u2019s progress, as emergency alerts bleated from their phones, signaling the latest evacuation orders.",
      "Wildfires flared up from time to time during my childhood here, but they were nothing like the enormous Dixie fire, now the second-largest on record in California. The summer skies were reliably clear back then, and we could lie on cots under the Ponderosa pines and watch as the night sky \u2014 now as blank as the light-polluted expanse above New York City \u2014 filled with stars.",
      "My grandfather\u2019s summer camp, the Walking G Ranch, closed years ago, but the lilac bushes I remember smelling after evening chores are still there, though parched. So are the mossy ponds that fill the air with the scent of watercress and mint.",
      "My aunt and uncle\u2019s house stands on a nearby wooded hill. It had already been a bad year, my aunt told me last week. There was the drought, which meant they could not harvest their own hay and had to buy bales to feed the cattle all winter. Then there was a plague of grasshoppers, which swarmed so thick they covered the cows.",
      "Like many in the valley, my relatives have packed their most important belongings into horse trailers, then parked the trailers in the middle of irrigated fields \u2014 where they too plan to go, they told me, as a last resort.",
      "To protect their homes, Indian Valley\u2019s residents have cleared brush and chopped down beloved trees as fire breaks. They have repurposed irrigation equipment to beat back the flames and rigged pumps to draft water from ponds. They have watched fire engines arrive and depart, moving in and out of the valley as the blaze advances or retreats.",
      "Even before the recent threat, the valley had seen its population decline sharply over the last several decades, as its mines and lumber mills shut down. Many of those who remain are older, some from families going back generations.",
      "Monroe White, a veteran and a onetime gold miner and logger, is 85. He would only leave, he said while sitting on the porch of the Taylorsville store, \u201cwhen I can read by the firelight and see it come over that hill.\u201d",
      "Last week, flames shot up over the ridges near Genesee and my family\u2019s old ranch. Police officers patrolled through the night, blasting sirens and commanding, \u201cPlease evacuate the area!\u201d My aunt texted her son, asking \u2014 as she finished packing \u2014 if he wanted a framed print hanging in his childhood bedroom.",
      "People in Taylorsville stalked back and forth to the firehouse, eager for updates. By the next day, the familiar yellow fire engines began to reappear, speeding in from another front on the enormous blaze. Then came the bulldozers and helicopters.",
      "As crews spread out over the forest, digging trenches, the blaze reached the Walking G. My family rushed the animals \u2014 the horses and sheep, the chickens and dogs \u2014 into stalls and pens in the barn it planned to defend alongside a local firefighter.",
      "As ash rained from the sky, they shot down embers with fire hoses. Then the engines came, too, spilling dozens of firefighters from all over the state.",
      "Finally, the fire moved on, racing over a hillock and down into the valley, where it jumped a creek and started burning in another forest. But the flames have returned in the days since. My relatives remain as planned, beating them back, as water-dumping helicopters thump through the once tranquil air.",
      "In the ridges all around, the Dixie fire continues to burn."

    "content": [
      "In the 16th hour of a Senate debate earlier this month, Cory Booker rose to speak around 1 a.m. \u201cI am so excited!\u201d he roared, bunching his shoulders and smacking a fist into his hand, like a pitcher trotting to the mound. Booker, who represents New Jersey, leaned back and put a hand into his pocket. He smiled and raised one eyebrow mischievously. \u201cThis is a gift,\u201d he declared. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t complete abdication of Senate procedures and esteem, I would walk over there and hug my colleague from Alabama.\u201d",
      "Booker was referring to an amendment to the 2022 budget \u2014 which was the subject of the Senate\u2019s marathon session \u2014 and to Tommy Tuberville, Alabama\u2019s newly elected senator, who proposed it moments earlier. \u201cMy amendment is pretty simple,\u201d Tuberville said. \u201cIf your City Council wants to defund their police, don\u2019t expect the federal government to make up the difference.\u201d Local leaders across the country, he went on, \u201chave decided the woke thing to do is cancel their city\u2019s police force,\u201d but Alabamians would not \u201cpick up the tab\u201d for the \u201cwoke defund-the-police movement.\u201d",
      "Woke, cancel, defund \u2014 Tuberville was practically auditioning for a spot on Tucker Carlson\u2019s show the next day. But in his turn at the lectern, Booker out-Foxed him. Tuberville\u2019s amendment was a gift, he said, because it would \u201cput to bed the scurrilous accusation that somebody in this great esteemed body would want to\u201d \u2014 he paused for faux-shocked effect \u2014 \u201cdefund the police.\u201d Booker urged every senator to \u201cnot walk, but sashay down\u201d to vote for Tuberville\u2019s amendment. He ended by calling on the Senate to add language expressing its unanimous support for \u201cGod, country and\u201d \u2014 knuckle rap of the lectern \u2014 \u201capple pie.\u201d",
      "Booker was, in other words, laying it on thick. The tone was a departure from his typical register, which calls to mind a preacher-turned-therapist. If Tuberville hoped to pin Democratic senators as all-cops-are-bastards radicals \u2014 or as beholden to Twitter activists of that ilk \u2014 Booker saw an opportunity to set the record straight. His clip drew chuckles from commentators on CNN and MSNBC, effectively foiling Tuberville\u2019s plans. And substantively, Booker got his wish. Tuberville\u2019s amendment passed by a vote of 99 to 0, thus completing a canny political turn for Democrats on the tricky matter of policing.",
      "A summer ago, in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s murder at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer and the racial-justice protests that followed, the party seemed genuinely split over whether to back growing calls on the left to defund the police. House members from swing districts, like Abigail Spanberger in Virginia, said that the defund movement played into the hands of Republicans by alienating moderate voters. House members from safe districts, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York City, advocated cutting police budgets and redirecting the money toward other public-safety measures.",
      "A core aspiration of the defund movement is to reduce violent encounters between officers and the public by deploying mental-health professionals to respond to some 911 calls. Some cities have started adding such services. Denver, for example, set up an alternative 911 response, with social workers answering some calls; similar pilot projects are in the works in Oakland and Portland, Ore. But however promising, these local experiments aren\u2019t what many of the loudest advocates for defunding the police had in mind \u2014 and it\u2019s not what their slogan, fairly or not, has come to stand for. Defunding the police has become associated with calls to take officers off the streets or even disband departments entirely \u2014 which can be hard to imagine in real-world terms. What would a city look like if unarmed public-safety officers replaced all the cops with guns? How do you take firearms away from the law enforcers in a country that has tens of millions more guns than citizens?",
      "Most Americans, across all demographics, share these concerns. In March 2021, a USA Today/Ipsos poll showed that just 18 percent support \u201cdefund.\u201d For Black Americans, the figure was a bit higher: 28 percent. But 43 percent of all respondents backed redirecting some police funds to social services. In New Haven, the majority-Black-and-Latino city where I live, the mayor\u2019s office is working on a new Department of Community Resilience to address violence prevention and crisis response, as well as homelessness, mental health, drug use and prison re-entry. But with homicides and shootings on the rise, the city is also putting more money into the police. Defunding is a nonstarter.",
      "Democrats can come across as craven when they disavow the passionate stance of the left wing of their party. Bill Clinton brought this criticism on himself when he singled out the activist Sister Souljah for her burst of anger toward white people in the midst of the Los Angeles riots in 1992. The \u201cSister Souljah moment\u201d has since become shorthand for any strategic break between Democratic politicians and the activist base. Booker\u2019s bit of theater in the Senate not only punched left but also aligned Democrats in the chamber with President Biden, who has been in favor of more money for cops for decades.",
      "If Booker successfully distanced his party from the defund movement, the question is what Democrats in Congress will have to show for it. The point of getting the politics right on an issue, after all, is to create a space to make policy. Booker, who has been one of the Senate\u2019s most engaged members on criminal-justice reform, has worked for months on the Senate\u2019s version of a police-reform bill named for George Floyd. \u201cI\u2019ve been bending and contorting myself in every way to try to make a bill that can attract people on both sides of the aisle,\u201d Booker told ABC News last month.",
      "But it has been a thankless task. Booker negotiated with two major police unions seeking a broad agreement that would pass muster with Republicans, but when he thought he had the basis for a deal, other law-enforcement unions objected. This led Senator Lindsey Graham to publicly denounce the proposal. Booker\u2019s talks with Senator Tim Scott, the negotiator for the Republicans, continue, but it\u2019s not clear where they\u2019re going.",
      "If Congress does nothing, despite all the promises and the heartbreak of police killings, it will shoulder responsibility for a half-measure the country has seen many times before: more money for the police but no new checks on their power. Democrats who have found their way to safe ground on the politics of defunding now have to keep making the case for what they want to do about policing. Solutions, though, don\u2019t often produce punchy TV clips."

    "content": [
      "It was in the middle of summer in 1980 when developers raising a pair of luxury condominium towers in Surfside, Fla., went to town officials with an unusual request: They wanted to add an extra floor to each building.",
      "The application to go higher was almost unheard-of for an ambitious development whose construction was already well underway. The builders had not mentioned the added stories in their original plans. It was not clear how much consideration they had given to how the extra floors would affect the structures overall. And, most galling for town officials, the added penthouses would violate height limits designed to prevent laid-back Surfside from becoming another Miami Beach.",
      "At one point, the town building department issued a terse stop-work order. But records show that in the face of an intense campaign that saw lawyers for the developers threaten lawsuits and argue with officials deep into the night, the opposition folded \u2014 and the developers got their way.",
      "Frank Filiberto, who was on the Town Commission at the time, recalled feeling as if the developers regarded him and the other officials as \u201clocal yokels.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey were bullies,\u201d Mr. Filiberto said. \u201cThere was a lot of anger.\u201d",
      "Although there is no indication that the catastrophic collapse of the Champlain Towers South building in June was related to the tacked-on penthouse, the alteration was just one of many contentious parts of a project that was pushed through by aggressive developers at a time when the local government seemed wholly unprepared for a new era of soaring condo projects.",
      "Surfside had only a part-time building inspector, George Desharnais, who worked at the same time for Bal Harbour, Bay Harbor Islands and North Bay Village. Records show that the Surfside building department delegated inspections of the towers back to the Champlain Towers builders, who tapped their own engineer to sign off on construction work. The town manager was unable to resolve the penthouse issue because, just as the issue came before the city, he was arrested on charges \u2014 later dismissed \u2014 of peeping into the window of a 13-year-old girl and abruptly resigned.",
      "The development team itself had a dubious record. The architect had been disciplined previously for designing a building with a sign structure that later collapsed in a hurricane. The structural engineer had run into trouble on an earlier project, too, when he signed off on a parking garage with steel reinforcement that was later found to be dangerously insufficient.",
      "The early 1980s was a freewheeling period for construction in the Miami area, known at the time for its uneven enforcement of regulations, but the Champlain Towers project stood apart \u2014 both for the tumult that occurred on the job site and the brazenness of the developers behind the project.",
      "Investigators with the National Institute of Standards and Technology are still in the early days of examining the building\u2019s collapse, with ongoing examinations of the integrity of the foundations and the strength of the materials used to support the building. The investigation will include a review of how the building was designed and constructed, including the building\u2019s modifications, the agency said on Wednesday.",
      "By the late 1970s, Surfside was still a humble corner of South Florida, so popular with Canadian snowbirds looking for a discounted slice of paradise that the town dedicated a week to celebrating the connection. Winners of the festival\u2019s beauty pageant could receive a trip to Canada.",
      "One of the Canadians with an eye on the town was the lead developer of Champlain Towers, Nathan Reiber, who brought a grand vision to reshape Surfside\u2019s waterfront at a time when the town was eager to find new sources of tax revenue to keep taxes low for full-time residents. As Mr. Reiber\u2019s team filed for the first Champlain Towers permits in August 1979 \u2014 with no 13th-story penthouses \u2014 city officials were struggling with serious inadequacies in the water and sewer systems that had led to a moratorium on new development.",
      "The Champlain Towers developers came up with a plan: They would provide $200,000 toward the needed upgrades \u2014 covering half the cost \u2014 if they could get to work on construction. The town agreed.",
      "\u201cIt was exciting,\u201d said Mitchell Kinzer, who was the mayor at the time. \u201cHere we are, little Surfside, a tiny town getting first-class luxury buildings.\u201d",
      "Mr. Reiber pursued the project even as he was dealing with legal troubles in Canada. A lawyer from Ontario who had ventured into real estate, Mr. Reiber and two partners were accused by Canadian prosecutors of dodging taxes in the 1970s by plundering the proceeds of coin-operated laundry machines in their buildings in a scheme to lessen their taxable income. The prosecutor also accused the group of using the expenses of a fake building project to avoid taxes on some $120,000 in rent payments.",
      "After court proceedings that dragged on for years, Mr. Reiber pleaded guilty to one count of tax evasion in 1996. Family members of Mr. Reiber, who died in 2014, did not respond to messages seeking comment.",
      "Mr. Reiber\u2019s lawyer, Stanley J. Levine, also figured prominently in the development of Champlain Towers, handling corporate work for some of the companies involved.",
      "About a decade earlier, Mr. Levine and a member of the Miami Beach City Council had been charged with soliciting an $8,000 bribe from a woman who wanted a zoning variance to build a 47-unit apartment building, according to news coverage from the time. The charge was later dropped. Mr. Levine died in 1999, and a member of his family could not be reached for comment.",
      "Allegations of influence-peddling also dogged the Champlain Towers project. In early 1980, the developers had made campaign contributions that were significant at the time \u2014 $100 to one commissioner, $200 to another. Mayor Kinzer objected, and the developers tried to take the money back.",
      "Rick Aiken, the town manager who later had to step down, said the Champlain Towers builders were constantly pressing the town to move faster on permits.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019d call me on the phone, want to take me to lunch so that I would push the commission toward giving them a permit,\u201d Mr. Aiken said. He told them that they needed to follow the rules, he said, adding that he could not recall any instances of the developers engaging in improper activity.",
      "On Nov. 13, 1979, the town approved the overall plans for the project.",
      "As the construction got underway at the Champlain Towers sites, both at their North and South properties, turmoil was emerging and plans were changing.",
      "By May, the project\u2019s lead contractor, Jorge Batievsky, had resigned. He soon filed a lawsuit, though records from the case have since been destroyed and Mr. Batievsky has died.",
      "The developers brought in a new contractor, Alfred Weisbrod, but problems continued.",
      "As the first levels of the South building were rising above the ground, a crane on site collapsed so violently that its steel was contorted, according to archived video. A week later, crews discovered that more than $10,000 in wood had been stolen from the site.",
      "But public anticipation was building. A newspaper ad for the unfinished buildings claimed that only 27 residences remained available. \u201cGet the best \u2014 while they last,\u201d it advised.",
      "By the end of the summer, the developers hired a new permanent contractor, Arnold Neckman, and in August they applied to add the new \u201cpenthouse\u201d floor to each property, raising the buildings from 12 stories to 13.",
      "The added weight brought by the penthouse had the potential to exacerbate a failure and contribute to the progressive collapse that killed 98 people this year, said Mehrdad Sasani, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Northeastern University who reviewed the building\u2019s design plans. He also said the decision to add a new floor to the top of a previous design was not an accepted practice.",
      "But the penthouse addition would not explain the cause of the collapse, Dr. Sasani said, since buildings are designed with large safety margins. \u201cThe relative weight of the penthouse compared to the weight of the structure is not so significant that it could have been an initial cause,\u201d Dr. Sasani said.",
      "There is no record of an objection from the architect on the project, William Friedman, or the structural engineer, Sergio Breiterman.",
      "Both had come to the project after some criticism of their past work. State regulators suspended Mr. Friedman\u2019s license for six months in 1967 after an investigation determined that he had designed a \u201cgrossly inadequate\u201d sign structure that fell over during Hurricane Betsy two years prior, damaging the structure of a Miami commercial building, according to records from the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation.",
      "About five years before the Champlain Towers project, Mr. Breiterman had been responsible for inspections on a $5 million parking garage in Coral Gables, where officials later found that the walls in the building lacked steel reinforcing rods that would prevent cars from crashing through, according to a 1976 article in The Miami Herald.",
      "Mr. Breiterman also got the job of inspecting work at Champlain Towers. He gave his seal of approval to the work in October 1980, before the penthouse dispute began.",
      "A month later, in November, the town appeared to approve the added-on penthouse permit, although it is unclear who signed off on the idea. Two weeks later, the police chief, serving as the interim town manager, sent a curt memo ordering the contractors to halt work, revoking their penthouse permits.",
      "The memo, sternly warning that the penthouses were in fact a violation of Surfside\u2019s codes, came on town letterhead, with the name of Mr. Aiken, the town manager who by that time had been arrested on the peeping charge, crossed off with a series of X\u2019s. (The case against him was later dismissed, with Mr. Aiken saying he had been looking for his dog behind people\u2019s homes.)",
      "Then, a week later, the Town Commission voted to allow the penthouses after all.",
      "Mr. Filiberto, the former commissioner, said he believed that some of the penthouse construction was already completed by then. He said the town was left with a tough choice: Grant a variance or order the builder to demolish the penthouse work \u2014 and face a lawsuit.",
      "Years later, Mr. Filiberto wondered whether the developers played equally loose with other aspects of the building project. \u201cIf they are that overt in violating the height orders,\u201d he said, \u201cthink about all the little intricacies that go into building the building.\u201d"

      "Had she heard, the women wondered, about the election coming up on Sept. 14?",
      "\u201cNo,\u201d Reyes replied, a look of puzzled curiosity crossing her face. What election?",
      "I saw this scene and many similar ones play out this month when I tagged along with Karen Diaz, 27, and Tanairy Guzman Reyes, 22, as they knocked on doors in Palmdale, a city north of Los Angeles. They were hoping to bolster support for Gov. Gavin Newsom as he faces an attempt to recall him from office.",
      "Voters, who by now should have gotten their ballots by mail, will be asked two questions: Should Newsom be recalled from office? And if so, who should replace him?",
      "The recall was once a long shot initiated by Republicans who disliked the governor\u2019s positions on issues like the death penalty and immigration. But the effort gained steam during the coronavirus pandemic, as conservative Californians bridled at business restrictions and mask mandates.",
      "As my colleague Shawn Hubler and I recently wrote, Democratic voters vastly outnumber Republicans in California, but experts say Newsom could be stymied by ambivalence and a lack of awareness about the election, particularly among those most likely to support him.",
      "That has progressive groups, including the state and national Democratic parties, working to sound the alarm: Newsom could be replaced by a Republican if Democrats don\u2019t cast their ballots.",
      "For many of the state\u2019s Latino voters, the fear is acute that Newsom\u2019s successor might roll back rights for undocumented immigrants or remove restrictions that protect essential workers, experts told me.",
      "\u201cThis election is too important to sit out,\u201d said Diaz, who is the electoral field manager for the immigrant advocacy group CHIRLA Action Fund, based in Los Angeles.",
      "We trudged up and down the sun-bleached streets of the neighborhood where Diaz grew up \u2014 her \u201chome turf,\u201d she said. She knew that many of the voters would be hearing from a political campaign for the first time.",
      "Her colleague, Guzman Reyes, who grew up in neighboring Lancaster, said she wasn\u2019t initially aware of the recall election, but when she found out that Newsom could be removed, she wanted to alert community members.",
      "\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t vote in special elections,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s coming out of nowhere, really.\u201d",
      "While experts initially predicted that the election would be in November, Newsom\u2019s allies moved to hold the vote earlier, allowing the governor to capitalize on optimism that we were finally leaving the pandemic behind. But as the Delta variant rages, that plan could backfire, experts say.",
      "So, Diaz and Guzman Reyes knocked on door after door, approaching people who were washing their cars or tidying their garages.",
      "Some of the residents, like Reyes, pledged to cast their votes for Newsom after speaking with the canvassers. One woman said her voice didn\u2019t matter.",
      "A few, though, had already heard about the election.",
      "Javier Rivera, 49, said he would vote to keep Newsom, who he said had handled a difficult situation well. He sees the governor as a staunch opponent of the former president.",

    "title": "House Passes a Voting Rights Bill, but a G.O.P. Blockade Awaits in the Senate",
    "content": [
      "The House voted on Tuesday to restore federal oversight of state election laws under the 1965 Voting Rights Act and expand its reach, as Democrats moved to strengthen a crowning legislative achievement of the civil rights era amid a renewed national fight over access to the ballot box.",
      "The legislation, named after Representative John Lewis of Georgia, the civil rights icon who died last year, is a linchpin of the party\u2019s strategy to combat voting restrictions in Republican-led states. It would reverse two Supreme Court rulings that gutted the statute, reviving the power of the Justice Department to bar some discriminatory election changes from taking effect and easing the path to challenge others in court.",
      "Up against urgent deadlines before next year\u2019s midterm elections, Democrats voted along party lines to adopt the bill 219 to 212 in a rare August session, just days after it was introduced. But stiff Republican opposition awaits in the Senate, where a likely filibuster threatens to sink it before it can reach President Biden\u2019s desk.",
      "That outcome is becoming familiar this summer, as Democrats on Capitol Hill try to use their party\u2019s control of Congress and the White House to lock in watershed election changes \u2014 only to be blocked by their Republican counterparts. In the meantime, more than a dozen G.O.P.-led states have already enacted more than 30 laws this year making it harder to vote.",
      "Frustration with that dynamic has fueled increasingly desperate calls from progressives and many mainstream Democrats to invoke the so-called nuclear option and eliminate the 60-vote filibuster threshold in the Senate. Doing so would allow Democrats to move unilaterally without Republican support, but any rules change would require support from all 50 Democrats in the chamber, and key moderates are opposed.",
      "Brimming with urgency and symbolism, the debate leading up to Tuesday\u2019s vote only served to deepen a divide between the parties over voting issues that has rapidly widened in the past year.",
      "Democrat after Democrat showed images of Mr. Lewis and warned that the victories for Black voting rights he won after being beaten bloody on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma half a century earlier were once again on the line. They pointed to new rules in Georgia, Ohio, Florida and elsewhere making it harder to vote by mail, to vote early or to register to vote close to Election Day, which they said disproportionately affected voters of color and young people.",
      "\u201cOld battles have indeed become new again,\u201d said Representative Terri A. Sewell, the Alabama Democrat who represents Selma and wrote the bill in Mr. Lewis\u2019s name. \u201cWhile literacy tests and poll taxes no longer exist, certain states and local jurisdictions have passed laws that are modern-day barriers to voting.\u201d",
      "Proponents of the bill framed it as a vital complement to Democrats\u2019 other major elections bill, the For the People Act, to halt and reverse that retrenchment, which has stalled in the Senate amid a Republican filibuster. Even more ambitious, that legislation would set new national standards making it easier to vote, end partisan gerrymandering and combat dark money.",
      "Republicans, who once enthusiastically supported expansions of the Voting Rights Act, dismissed that concern as hyperbolic and self-serving. Democrats, they argued, were ignoring the nation\u2019s racial progress as justification to allow the federal government to run roughshod over the states and rewrite election rules in a way that would benefit their political candidates.",
      "\u201cNot only is our country not facing a new era of Jim Crow voting laws, as many of my Democrat colleagues have claimed, it is incredibly offensive to lie to the American people to advance a political agenda,\u201d said Representative Rodney Davis, Republican of Illinois.",
      "He cited statistics showing record turnout among Black voters during the 2020 election, a far cry from the small percentages that were able to vote in many Southern states the 1960s.",
      "\u201cWe should celebrate this progress, not ignore it,\u201d Mr. Davis said.",
      "Much of the present conflict can be traced to 2013, when a conservative majority of the Supreme Court effectively struck down a crucial provision of the Voting Rights Act in the case of Shelby County v. Holder. The provision required states and jurisdictions with a history of discriminatory voting practices \u2014 mostly in the South \u2014 to clear any changes to their election rules with the federal government before carrying them out.",
      "It had been highly effective, blocking more than 3,000 proposed electoral changes found to be discriminatory during the half century it was in effect and contributing to the statute\u2019s reputation as one of the clearest legislative successes of the civil rights movement. But the justices ruled that the formula used to determine which entities should be subject to such requirements was outdated given the country\u2019s progress, and said Congress would have to update it for it to be constitutional.",
      "In the absence of any so-called federal pre-clearance requirement, more than half of states have enacted laws making it harder to vote over the last eight years. Voting advocates have been just as concerned that in its absence, state lawmakers will be able to use the once-in-a-decade redistricting process that is underway to marginalize voters of color.",
      "Then, last month, the Supreme Court in Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee took aim at a separate section of the statute and made it harder to win court challenges against election rules on the grounds that they are discriminatory.",
      "Lawmakers drafted the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to reverse both rulings and spent months collecting a careful legislative record in anticipation that any changes that became law would be scrutinized by the justices.",
      "At its core is a new formula for determining which states and local entities should be subject to pre-clearance by looking at voting rights violations over the last 25 years. At least one analysis suggests eight states \u2014 Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas \u2014 and a handful of counties would be subject to such oversight.",
      "But it would also require most jurisdictions in the country \u2014 not just those with a history of discrimination \u2014 to get federal approval before adopting certain sensitive electoral changes, like stringent new voter identification requirements, removing polling places, completing the lines of electoral districts or putting in place new policies to cull voter rolls en masse.",
      "Other provisions tucked in the bill could have a meaningful impact on voting disputes. For example, the legislation would lower the bar for plaintiffs suing to stop elections changes under the Voting Rights Act to win preliminary injunctions to keep them from taking effect until a court can review them. Currently, elections changes that are later struck down can often take effect for months or even years because the lawsuits take so long to resolve.",
      "Elsewhere, the legislation appears to take direct aim at many of the Republican state officials who have used unsubstantiated and often vague concerns about voter fraud \u2014 particularly the false claims promulgated by former President Donald J. Trump \u2014 to justify locking in new restrictions on mail-in ballots and the use of drop boxes, or to cut back on early voting. Merely invoking concerns of \u201cvoter fraud\u201d is not enough, the bill says, implying that states would have to provide evidence to back up their claims.",
      "Senators are still negotiating their own version of the legislation and have yet to settle on a date to reintroduce it or call a vote. Unlike the For the People Act, it is likely to attract some bipartisan support \u2014 but not nearly enough to pass it.",
      "Only one Republican, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, has been willing to attach her name to similar bills in recent years. A spokeswoman for Ms. Murkowski declined to comment on the House version of the bill, but the senator told The New York Times earlier this year that she did not believe she could find nine other Republicans to join her in breaking the filibuster to pass the bill."

      "\u201cIt should be six, seven, eight foot tall,\u201d he said, looking down at the stunted plants at his feet, their normally floppy leaves rolled tight against their stalks to conserve water in the summer heat.",
      "Like ranchers across the state, Mr. Rice is suffering through an epic drought as bad or worse than anywhere else in this season of extreme weather in the Western half of the country.",
      "A lack of snow last winter and almost no spring rain have created the driest conditions in generations. Ranchers are being forced to sell off portions of herds they have built up for years, often at fire-sale prices, to stay in business.",
      "Some won\u2019t make it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a really bad situation,\u201d said Randy Weigel, a cattle buyer, who said this drought may force some older ranchers to retire. \u201cThey\u2019ve worked all their lives to get their cow herd to where they want, and now they don\u2019t have enough feed to feed them.\u201d",
      "Since December, in the weekly maps produced by the United States Drought Monitor, all of North Dakota has been colored in shades of yellow, orange and red, symbolizing various degrees of drought. And since mid-May, McHenry County, where Mr. Rice ranches and farms, has been squarely in the middle of a swath of the darkest red, denoting the most extreme conditions.",
      "The period from January 2020 to this June has been the driest 18 months in McHenry and 11 other counties in the state since modern record keeping began 126 years ago, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been ranching for 47 years and then this year had to come along,\u201d said John Marshall, who ranches with his son, Lane, not far from Mr. Rice in this sprawling county where the county seat, Towner, bills itself as the cattle capital of North Dakota. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst thing I can ever remember.\u201d",
      "Drought conditions that are affecting nearly half the land area of the lower 48 states are helping send beef prices higher in America\u2019s grocery stores. But ranchers here say they aren\u2019t seeing that money \u2014 slaughterhouses and other middlemen are. If anything, the ranchers said, they are losing money because they are getting less from the forced sale of their animals.",
      "The Marshalls have already sold about 100 cows and plan to sell at least another 120, which would leave them with about two-thirds of their usual herd. \u201cNever had to do it before,\u201d Mr. Marshall said.",
      "Mr. Rice\u2019s corn, which is stored as silage to feed his animals later in the year, is so short that if he tried to harvest now it he couldn\u2019t. \u201cIt\u2019s unchoppable,\u201d he said.",
      "If he gets some rain \u2014 a big if, as the forecast into the fall is for continued heat and dryness \u2014 the corn may reach six feet, or half its usual height. Even then he would be looking at a shortage of feed, and would very likely have to have his cows weighed at the communal ranchers\u2019 scale off Main Street in Towner and then sold to a buyer elsewhere.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t get silage,\u201d he said, \u201cthe cows are going to town.\u201d",
      "Rachel Wald, who works for North Dakota State University advising and supporting ranchers, said that livestock auction houses, called sale barns, had been very busy this spring and summer. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 2,000 critters heading down the road each week\u201d in the county, she said. By some estimates, half the cattle in the state may be gone by fall.",
      "For ranchers who have spent years building up the genetics of their herd, that can mean a giant step backward. \u201cEvery year we try to better our breed,\u201d said Shelby Wallman, who with her husband, Daryl, has been ranching for decades in Rhame, in the southwestern corner of the state.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a calling,\u201d she said. \u201cYou spend your entire life with these cattle. I can tell you, there\u2019s going to be tears.\u201d",
      "North Dakotans have seen drought many times before. One in 1988 was particularly bad, although John Marshall and others who made it through that year said the current drought is worse.",
      "Ranchers point to the variable nature of the climate here \u2014 where a dry year or two may easily be followed by a wet period \u2014 instead of talking about climate change. Yet climate change is occurring in North Dakota, as it is everywhere else.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re at the epicenter of a changing climate,\u201d said Adnan Akyuz, the state\u2019s climatologist and a professor at North Dakota State University. The state has warmed by 2.4 degrees Fahrenheit (about 1.3 degrees Celsius) over the past century, he said. That\u2019s one of the largest increases in the United States.",
      "North Dakota\u2019s climate is expected to become even more variable, with more extreme rainfall and heat. And as elsewhere, droughts are expected to grow in intensity and frequency.",
      "Conditions are highly variable in large part because North Dakota is so far from the oceans, which have a moderating effect on climate. When the state doesn\u2019t get moisture from them, it relies on local sources, including lakes, rivers and reservoirs, along with moist air that funnels into the region in late spring and summer from the Gulf of Mexico.",
      "But that Gulf moisture did not arrive this year. And heat has dried up many of the local water sources. The result is air that sucks all the moisture it can from the soil and from plants.",
      "Signs of drought-stressed vegetation can be seen across McHenry County. Stunted silage corn like Mr. Rice\u2019s is called pineapple corn, because the tight leaves make it look more like a pineapple plant. Elsewhere, soybean plants have flipped their leaves over to reduce photosynthesis and thus the need for water, giving them a paler green appearance.",
      "And in the Marshalls\u2019 pastures, grass that would normally be green and reach the knee is brown and stubby.",
      "The Marshalls rely on clean well water pumped into troughs for most of their cattle. But they and other ranchers also use watering holes, which collect snow runoff and rain. And as watering holes dry up, nutrients and other compounds in the water become more concentrated, which can sicken animals.",
      "In one of the Marshalls\u2019 watering holes, the level had dropped by several feet. Ms. Wald, from the university, tested for sulfates and dissolved solids and told the Marshalls that the water was still good. But she noticed something else.",
      "\u201cLane, one of the things I\u2019d watch out for here is actually blue-green algae,\u201d she said. Amid the heat the organisms were flourishing and could eventually release toxins that could harm cattle. \u201cIf a bloom occurs you have to move the animals out of here and find them a new water source,\u201d Ms. Wald said.",
      "Like other ranchers, the Marshalls have bought supplemental feed. But with the drought sending feed prices higher, at some point it makes more financial sense to sell animals.",
      "That has kept auctioneers busy. At a recent sale at Kist Livestock Auction in Mandan, just across the Missouri River from Bismarck, ranchers in pickup trucks, trailers in tow, lined up to unload cattle they couldn\u2019t afford to keep.",
      "Tom Fettig and his wife, Kim, were there with 60 yearlings, about half of a herd they were helping their son raise on the outskirts of Bismarck. The animals had been bought in February with the goal of fattening them until October, when they would be sold to a feedlot.",
      "The drought ruined those plans. \u201cWe\u2019ve only had them out on pasture since June 1,\u201d Mr. Fettig said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing left.\u201d",
      "Their hay crop has been abysmal as well. In a normal year they\u2019d end up with 800 to 900 bales. So far this year they have only 21.",
      "Inside the semicircular auction ring, the Fettigs sat on a bench and waited for their yearlings to come up for sale. They watched as a parade of other animals entered and the auctioneer, Darin Horner, rattled off prices in a droning hum. Weights and prices flashed on screens above the auctioneer\u2019s head.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a nice set of steers right off the prairie,\u201d Mr. Horner announced as the Fettigs\u2019 animals crowded the ring in two groups of 30. They sold for about $1,250 apiece \u2014 perhaps $150 a head less, Mr. Fettig said, than if they\u2019d been able to feed them all summer.",
      "The Fettigs and John Marshall are fortunate in that their sons have followed them in the ranching business. But Jerry Kist, a co-owner of the auction barn, noted that older ranchers whose children have left the land were the most vulnerable in this drought, as were younger ranchers who don\u2019t have ranching parents they can rely on to help them become established.",
      "\u201cYou just don\u2019t want to see these guys folding and selling their whole cow herd,\u201d Mr. Kist said."

    "title": "House Passes $3.5 Trillion Budget Plan for Vast Expansion of Safety Net",
    "content": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A divided House on Tuesday approved a $3.5 trillion budget blueprint that would pave the way for a vast expansion of social safety net and climate programs, as Democrats overcame sharp internal rifts to advance a critical piece of President Biden\u2019s ambitious domestic agenda.",
      "Approving the budget was a major step in Democrats\u2019 drive to enact their top priorities \u2014 including huge investments in education, child care, health care, paid leave, and tax increases on wealthy people and corporations \u2014 over united Republican opposition. With a single vote on Tuesday, they laid the groundwork to move quickly on legislation that would accomplish those goals, setting a late September deadline for action on a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package.",
      "But it came only after leaders stamped out a revolt among conservative-leaning Democrats, who withheld their votes until they extracted a promise to vote on the infrastructure bill by Sept. 27. The breakthrough came after a pressure campaign by the White House, outside progressive groups and Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, who haggled and cajoled her way to unanimous Democratic support for a measure that had been stalled mere hours before.",
      "The vote was 220 to 212 on party lines to approve the budget plan and allow future votes on both the infrastructure bill and a voting rights measure that the House passed soon after.",
      "While the budget plan, which passed the Senate this month, does not have the force of law, it allows Democrats to move forward with a fast-track process known as reconciliation. That would enshrine the details of the blueprint in legislation that is shielded from a filibuster, allowing it to pass over the objections of Republicans.",
      "It is expected to include universal preschool, paid family leave, federal support for child care and elder care, an expansion of Medicare and a broad effort to tackle climate change \u2014 all paid for through tax increases on high earners and companies.",
      "\u201cToday is a great day of pride for our country and for Democrats,\u201d Ms. Pelosi declared on the House floor, after days of intensive talks with rank-and-file lawmakers. \u201cNot only are we building the physical infrastructure of America, we are building the human infrastructure of America to enable many more people to participate in the success of our economy and the growth of our society.\u201d",
      "Speaking at the White House shortly after, Mr. Biden called Ms. Pelosi \u201cmasterful,\u201d and lavished praise on the party\u2019s leadership team and every congressional Democrat who ultimately supported the legislation.",
      "\u201cThere were differences, strong points of view \u2014 they\u2019re always welcome,\u201d the president said. \u201cWhat is important is that we came together to advance our agenda.\u201d",
      "But the herculean effort it took to do so only served to illustrate the difficult road ahead for Mr. Biden\u2019s agenda on Capitol Hill, where Democrats\u2019 small majorities and ideological divisions \u2014 as well as Republican opposition \u2014 have left the party with little room to maneuver.",
      "The same differences between moderates and progressives that nearly derailed the plan this week promise to resurface in the weeks to come, as progressives push to make the reconciliation bill as far-reaching as possible and conservative-leaning Democrats work to limit its scope.",
      "In a joint statement, Representative Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey and eight other moderates who had conditioned their votes for the budget on a deadline for action on infrastructure boasted that their group had succeeded in making sure that the bipartisan bill would \u201creceive stand-alone consideration, fully de-linked, and on its own merits.\u201d",
      "But moments after the budget plan passed, a large group of liberal Democrats signaled that they still regarded the two measures as linked, raising the prospect of another standoff next month.",
      "\u201cAs our members have made clear for three months, the two are integrally tied together, and we will only vote for the infrastructure bill after passing the reconciliation bill,\u201d Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington, the leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said in a statement.",
      "In the evenly divided Senate, leaders need the votes of every Democrat and independent \u2014 plus Vice President Kamala Harris, who can break ties \u2014 to win passage of the reconciliation bill. In the House, the margin is only slightly more forgiving, allowing as few as three Democrats to defect if all Republicans are opposed, as expected.",
      "The commitment to a Sept. 27 vote on the bipartisan infrastructure package added to a chaotic series of deadlines next month, when lawmakers will have only a few days in Washington to consider the infrastructure bill, prevent a lapse in government funding on Oct. 1, and steer the government away from the brink of a catastrophic debt default by raising the statutory limit on the nation\u2019s borrowing. Party leaders have instructed committees to finish writing pieces of the reconciliation package by Sept. 15, though it is unclear whether they will be able to do so.",
      "For now, the deal that Ms. Pelosi struck amounted to a precarious d\u00e9tente for Democrats that did nothing to resolve tensions between the moderate and liberal flanks or end the jockeying for political leverage.",
      "The divisions began to flare this month, when nine centrist Democrats publicly announced that they would not advance the budget blueprint until the House passed the Senate-passed bipartisan infrastructure agreement, which omits many of the party\u2019s highest priorities. Liberals called the compromise insufficient.",
      "Ms. Pelosi had already said she would not move the infrastructure bill, which includes $550 billion in new funding for roads, bridges, water and climate resiliency projects, until the reconciliation bill passed.",
      "That led to a stalemate this week, as Ms. Pelosi called the House back for a rare summer session.",
      "In a series of phone calls and private meetings that stretched past midnight on Monday, Democratic leaders sought to persuade their colleagues to drop their insistence on passing the infrastructure bill first. They did so after securing a hard commitment, enshrined in legislation, that a vote would come on or before Sept. 27.",
      "Ultimately, Ms. Pelosi also pledged that the House would vote only on a reconciliation package that could clear the Senate, sparing moderate lawmakers tough votes on provisions that could never become law.",
      "Representative Stephanie Murphy of Florida, who joined the Democratic holdouts on Monday, said the negotiation showed that centrists were willing to use their sway in the House.",
      "\u201cI think what it is a sign of is that moderates are serious about legislating in a responsible, transparent, inclusive way,\u201d Ms. Murphy said before the vote, adding that she had personally sent a list of proposed changes to Democratic leaders to ensure moderate support.",
      "But the episode was grueling for all involved. Asked early Tuesday whether the agreement was a win for Mr. Gottheimer, Ms. Pelosi responded with an incredulous \u201ca win?\u201d",
      "A weary Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, the chairman of the Rules Committee who convened his panel three times in two days as the talks dragged on, said he had had enough.",
      "\u201cI love you all, but I\u2019m done, and we should move forward and not meet again for a while,\u201d Mr. McGovern told lawmakers on the committee.",
      "Yet despite the potentially messy path ahead, leading Democrats said they were confident that Mr. Biden\u2019s agenda would emerge from Congress intact, even as moderate senators push to rein in the overall price tag.",
      "\u201cBoth are going to pass, whatever the sequence,\u201d said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 Democrat.",
      "But progressive lawmakers remain concerned that if the reconciliation bill did not go first, provisions addressing climate change, paid family leave, health care and educational opportunity could fall by the wayside, lacking enough support to be enacted into law.",
      "Many faulted their conservative-leaning colleagues for threatening to derail the budget plan and said no deadline would be enough to separate the infrastructure bill from the budget legislation.",
      "\u201cThe whole thing was a fiasco, to be honest,\u201d said Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, the whip of the Progressive Caucus. \u201cThe commitment still is there for us to follow through the strategy of having both of these pieces of legislation simultaneously move together.\u201d",
      "While some Republicans are expected to support the bipartisan infrastructure bill, they were uniformly opposed to the budget blueprint, citing concerns about its size, proposed tax increases and the possibility that the additional spending would worsen inflation. The House Republican campaign arm began targeting the moderate lawmakers who had ultimately backed the budget, saying the vote \u201cproves they\u2019re willing to sell out their constituents.\u201d",
      "\u201cA budget is supposed to put Washington on a sustainable fiscal path and help the American people keep Congress honest about its spending,\u201d said Representative Jason Smith of Missouri, the top Republican on the Budget Committee. \u201cUnfortunately, Washington Democrats are using the budget as a political tool to unleash trillions in new spending and taxes and enact misguided policies.\u201d"

    "title": "Biden Faces a Trade-Off: Stop Corruption, or Migration?",
    "content": [
      "The testimony was explosive: In June, a witness told Guatemala\u2019s top anticorruption prosecutor that he had gone to the president\u2019s home and delivered a rolled-up carpet stuffed with cash.",
      "It brought the prosecutor, Juan Francisco Sandoval, one step closer to a head-on collision with Guatemala\u2019s president.",
      "Mr. Sandoval\u2019s anticorruption unit had already searched a home linked to the president\u2019s former secretary, looking for information about $16 million his team had found jammed into suitcases. And in May, a witness told him that the president had negotiated a $2.6 million campaign contribution in exchange for maintaining government contracts, documents show.",
      "The president attacked Mr. Sandoval publicly. Top American officials, including Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, expressed alarm over efforts to undermine the anticorruption unit \u2014 but the pressure didn\u2019t work.",
      "In July, Mr. Sandoval was abruptly fired and, fearing the investigation would be snuffed out, fled the country with the evidence he had gathered.",
      "\u201cThe Guatemalan justice system has been overtaken by the mafias in power,\u201d Mr. Sandoval said in an interview from the United States. \u201cI was the last visible holdout in the fight against corruption.\u201d",
      "This is the stark reality facing the Biden administration as it grapples with the migration crisis on its southern border. Most of the families and children caught crossing the border in recent years have come from Central America, and the surge is accelerating. Border crossings in July, when officials expected a lull because of the deadly summer heat, reached their highest levels in more than two decades.",
      "President Biden arrived in office promising to attack corruption in the region head on, arguing that the only way to deter migrants is to fix the deep-seated problems that force people to leave home in the first place.",
      "He tapped Vice President Kamala Harris to oversee a proposed $4 billion effort to tackle those \u201croot causes\u201d of migration, starting in Guatemala \u2014 the country where officials believed they had the best shot at success. Ms. Harris met with Guatemala\u2019s president, Alejandro Giammattei, on her first international trip, and delivered a speech vowing to \u201croot out corruption wherever it exists.\u201d",
      "But the Biden administration is also depending on the very governments it has promised to police. Ms. Harris\u2019s meeting with the president took place only days after his public attack on the prosecutor, and the corruption allegations have not deterred the Biden administration from reaching agreements with him on migration.",
      "Urged by the United States, Guatemala agreed to increase the number of troops and police officers at its borders to block people from fleeing north and stop migrant caravans before they made it to Mexico. Guatemala ended up beating migrants in a recent caravan with batons and spraying them with tear gas. The migrants didn\u2019t get past the Guatemalan border.",
      "Wary of torpedoing cooperation on migration, the Biden administration has often been slow to back up its condemnation of corruption with retribution for bad actors in high places. Now, the space between America\u2019s tough talk and its actions is being filled by Central America\u2019s strongman leaders, who have spent months tightening their hold on power and systematically targeting opponents who stand in their way.",
      "In recent months, El Salvador\u2019s governing party ousted the attorney general and five Supreme Court justices, pushed forward with plans to try to extend presidential term limits, and adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in part to lessen the nation\u2019s dependence on the U.S. dollar.",
      "Guatemala\u2019s attorney general, whom the president has called a friend, replaced Mr. Sandoval with a prosecutor under investigation for mishandling a case against a former president\u2019s campaign donors. Now, remaining members of the anticorruption unit say some of its most important cases are being undermined.",
      "In a statement, the president\u2019s office denied that Mr. Giammattei had accepted bribes or engaged in corruption, and stated his \u201cabsolute commitment\u201d to help clear up any confusion surrounding the allegations.",
      "And in Nicaragua, the government is tilting ever closer to dictatorship, as President Daniel Ortega has jailed almost every candidate who planned to run against him in elections this year.",
      "\u201cYou have to be careful about how you make good on your threats,\u201d said Tom Shannon, who was a high-level State Department official in the Obama and Trump administrations and is now lobbying on behalf of El Salvador\u2019s government.",
      "\u201cOrtega has decided that we don\u2019t have it in us to face him down,\u201d said Mr. Shannon, referring to Nicaragua\u2019s president. \u201cSo he\u2019s standing in the middle of the road with both middle fingers extended at us, and the whole region is watching.\u201d",
      "The administration admits that its anticorruption push hasn\u2019t worked well enough, thwarted by powerful forces in Central America that are resistant to change.",
      "\u201cWe have to acknowledge that what we\u2019ve done up until now has not succeeded in demonstrating the importance of dealing with this,\u201d said Ricardo Z\u00faniga, the State Department\u2019s special envoy to the region. \u201cThose who are invested in the status quo see efforts to combat impunity and corruption as threatening to their interests\u201d and \u201care very determined to preserve that status quo.\u201d",
      "Central America\u2019s antidemocratic slide accelerated under Mr. Trump, who maintained a transactional relationship with the region: As long as the region\u2019s leaders stepped up efforts to intercept migrants, he would largely stay silent on their internal affairs, former officials said. Mr. Trump also made it clear that if they refused, he was willing to mete out punishment quickly \u2014 by cutting aid or imposing tariffs, as he did with Mexico.",
      "So Central American governments beefed up enforcement on their borders but also began dismantling key anticorruption units that were investigating the powerful.",
      "Mr. Biden came to office with fewer allies than ever in the fight for accountability in the region, and while few would expect him to match Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to inflict pain on nations to get his way, current and former officials say that the administration\u2019s relative passivity in the face of corruption has cost the United States leverage in the region.",
      "Besides a handful of new sanctions and the removal of visas for corrupt actors in the region, much of the sharpest U.S. response has been confined to expressions of anger in news interviews and Twitter posts.",
      "\u201cThe tweets are assertions and warnings, which of course have to be backed up pretty quickly by concrete measures or else they will be disregarded,\u201d said Stephen McFarland, the former American ambassador to Guatemala from 2008 to 2011.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like when you tell your kid, \u2018Don\u2019t do something,\u2019 but when they do it, there\u2019s no consequences,\u201d said Damian Merlo, a lobbyist representing El Salvador\u2019s government. \u201cWith Trump,\u201d he added, \u201cthere would be consequences.\u201d",
      "After Mr. Sandoval\u2019s dismissal, the administration is trying to take a tougher line on Guatemala, saying it would stop cooperating with the attorney general\u2019s office. But the administration is still working with the president, Mr. Giammattei: In July, the United States resumed expelling migrants by putting them on flights directly back to Guatemala, a move that has earned criticism from human rights groups.",
      "\u201cTheir priority is migration, and they are sacrificing justice,\u201d said Helen Mack Chang, a Guatemalan human rights activist. \u201cThey\u2019re doing the same thing as Trump.\u201d",
      "In the weeks before he was fired, Mr. Sandoval and his team worked furiously to compile evidence corroborating testimony from the witness claiming to have dropped off a carpet full of cash at the president\u2019s house.",
      "They determined that the witness had likely stumbled upon a plan by a Russian-backed mining company to bribe Mr. Giammattei for the right to operate part of a Guatemalan port. After dropping off the carpet stuffed with money, the witness heard one of the men say they had just guaranteed \u201can open door with the port,\u201d according to his statement.",
      "Then in July, just weeks after the inquiry had begun, Mar\u00eda Consuelo Porras, the attorney general and a close ally of the president, dismissed Mr. Sandoval, claiming that he had failed to follow orders. Mr. Sandoval was certain she would kill the inquiry, so he absconded with documents from the case and delivered them to American law enforcement officials when he fled to Washington.",
      "The Department of Justice is now looking into the allegations, according to a U.S. official.",
      "Ms. Consuelo Porras vowed that the work of the anticorruption unit once led by Mr. Sandoval would not be obstructed. But two prosecutors from that unit, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said in interviews that she was already undermining their investigations.",
      "\u201cThe investigations are in the hands of the corrupt,\u201d Mr. Sandoval said. \u201cNo one is stopping them.\u201d"

    "title": "For States Dealing With the Spotted Lanternfly, the Policy Is No Mercy",
    "content": [
      "Adorned with pale, pinkish gray wings, black dots and a scarlet undercoat, the spotted lanternfly is a beautiful insect.",
      "It\u2019s also an invasive species and a rapacious consumer of plants that has a particularly strong appetite for apple trees, plum trees and grapevines.",
      "If you see one, be ruthless, federal officials and agriculture departments from states up and down the Northeast have instructed.",
      "Squash it and destroy its babies before they take over your county, they say.",
      "If that seems harsh, consider this: They lay eggs by the dozens; they leave oozing sap on trees, vines and crops; and when they feed, they excrete a sweet substance that leads to the growth of black mold.",
      "They are no murder hornets; they are harmless to animals and humans. But they can devastate valuable crops like vineyards. In 2019, researchers at the Penn State College of Agricultural Sciences warned that the spotted lanternfly had the potential to cost Pennsylvania\u2019s economy $325 million a year and 2,800 jobs.",
      "They cover trees by the hundreds and swarm in the air. The sweet substance they secrete, known as honeydew, has coated decks and playgrounds.",
      "\u201cThese are called bad bugs for a reason,\u201d said the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture, which has set up a hotline \u2014 1-888-4BADFLY \u2014 for residents to report sightings. The New Jersey Department of Agriculture named its eradication campaign Stomp It Out. In Ohio, residents have been told to scrape off any lanternfly eggs they see on trees, double-bag them, and throw them away or immerse them in hand sanitizer or alcohol.",
      "The need to stamp out the bug will grow even more urgent next month, when the adults must feed voraciously to reproduce so they can lay eggs around October and November, said Julie Urban, an evolutionary biologist in the Penn State entomology department who has studied lanternflies for two decades.",
      "She said she had heard joggers in Pennsylvania parks scream when the insects landed on them. Yoga practitioners at a vineyard were unnerved one year when swarms of lanternflies began hitting them on the head, Professor Urban said.",
      "She said she had collected pictures from homeowners who found their decks blackened by the sooty mold. They are so enraging, Professor Urban said, that about two years ago she saw a small girl take off her flip-flop and beat the insects at a pagoda that had become infested.",
      "\u201cIt was horrible,\u201d she said.",
      "Sam Landis, a partner at Vynecrest Vineyards & Winery, said he had no qualms about smashing the insects.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing cute about them,\u201d said Mr. Landis, who said he had been fighting infestations of his grapevines for four years.",
      "In that time, lanternflies have killed off an acre or two of grapevines each year, Mr. Landis said, adding that the vineyard had paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to remove dead vines, plant new ones and invest in insect repellent.",
      "But in Mr. Landis\u2019s experience, pesticides don\u2019t do much.",
      "\u201cA day or two later, they\u2019re back,\u201d he said.",
      "Lanternflies, which measure about one inch long and use their mouths to suck sap from plants and trees, are easy to kill, Professor Urban said.",
      "\u201cWe joke that harsh language will kill it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty delicate for an insect that is so large.\u201d",
      "Most pesticides will kill them, and they are easy to catch and smash. They also die easily when heat or frost arrives. The most aggressive and effective way to stop their spread is to remove one of their favorite food sources: the tree of heaven, which is also an invasive plant, Professor Urban said.",
      "The lanternflies\u2019 best defense is in their ability to reproduce. They breed in huge numbers, laying 30 to 50 eggs at a time. Their eggs, which can be laid virtually anywhere, including on trees, trucks and the tops of railroad cars, take eight months to hatch, Professor Urban said.",
      "\u201cThat gives them time to be transported via humans\u2019 travel,\u201d she said.",
      "Despite its name, the lanternfly is a plant-hopper, not a fly. It first appeared in the United States in September 2014, most likely from China, Professor Urban said.",
      "The insects were spotted on imported stone at a landscape supply center in Berks County, Pa., she added.",
      "Since then, lanternflies have spread across the northeastern United States. In Delaware, the state Department of Agriculture is monitoring and trying to eradicate five satellite populations, said Stacey Hofmann, a spokeswoman for the agency. Reports of sightings keep coming from two counties, and the state is worried that a third may have become infested.",
      "\u201cPeople may not realize that the insect has fallen into the bed of their truck, hopped into their car or is on an R.V. or boat,\u201d Ms. Hofmann said.",
      "In New Jersey, eight counties have been designated \u201cquarantine zones,\u201d which means in part that residents should inspect their vehicles before they travel. In Pennsylvania, where there have been 18,000 reported sightings of the lanternfly, 34 counties are under similar restrictions.",
      "Other states are worried about infestations. In California in 2019, dead lanternflies were found in cargo planes from Allentown, Pa. In Virginia, David Gianino, the state\u2019s plant regulatory official, said lanternflies had laid eggs on railway tracks used by local and Amtrak trains.",
      "In Delaware, residents have been urged to walk around their cars and examine grilles, wheel wells and mirrors to kill any potential stowaways, Ms. Hofmann said.",
      "\u201cThey are surprisingly strong and will hold on even at high speeds,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t be the reason that a new population gets established.\u201d"

      "Just across the state line in Nevada, some schools in the Reno-Sparks area and in Lake Tahoe were closed Monday because of wildfire smoke.",
      "While wildfires occur throughout the West every year, scientists see the influence of climate change in the extreme heat waves that have contributed to the intensity of fires this summer. Prolonged periods of abnormally high temperatures are a signal of a shifting climate, they say.",
      "Mr. Porter said that over the next week, the southern part of California would see a low-to-moderate risk for new fires, which will allow officials to shift firefighting resources to the north, where the risk for new fires will be slightly higher.",
      "There are at least 10 other fires burning throughout California, particularly in the north. The McFarland fire near Redding has burned 118,000 acres and was 66 percent contained, according to a New York Times wildfire tracker. The Monument fire, also near Redding, has burned 150,000 acres and was 20 percent contained. The Dixie fire, the second-largest on record in California, continues to spread, burning more than 720,000 acres at 38 percent containment.",
      "On Monday, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California requested a Presidential Major Disaster Declaration to assist state and local wildfire response and recovery efforts in eight counties. The request is in direct response to the Dixie, Antelope, McFarland, Monument and River fires. An additional request may be made for the Caldor fire.",
      "There are more than 90 active large fires and complexes nationwide, including in Oregon, where a firefighter was killed when a tree fell on him. So far this year, more than 41,000 fires have burned about 4.5 million acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.",
      "\u201cThese are our days,\u201d Mr. Porter said. \u201cThis is what we do. Every year we need to be ready for this type of activity.\u201d"

    "content": [
      "No statistical model could explain it, and when a Massachusetts man and his two sons cashed in more than 13,000 winning lottery tickets worth nearly $21 million over eight years, federal prosecutors and lottery officials said it was anything but luck.",
      "\u201cA statistician will say that there\u2019s some astronomical odd,\u201d Michael R. Sweeney, the executive director of the Massachusetts State Lottery, said in an interview. \u201cBut the reality is, it\u2019s zero.\u201d",
      "In a 19-page indictment that was unsealed on Monday in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts, Ali Jaafar and his sons Mohamed Jaafar and Yousef Jaafar were collectively charged with more than a dozen counts of fraud, money laundering and tax evasion for taking part in what the authorities say was a ticket-cashing scheme. A vast majority of the tickets were the scratch-off type that are typically sold at convenience stores, prosecutors said.",
      "From 2011 to 2019, according to the indictment, the Jaafars claimed the prizes on behalf of the actual winners, who potentially avoided having their winnings garnished for unpaid taxes or child support, a requirement for any prize over $600 in Massachusetts.",
      "The Jaafars then falsely reported six- and seven-figure gambling losses on their tax returns, allowing them to drastically reduce the taxes they paid on the winnings, prosecutors said.",
      "The family had previously raised the suspicions of lottery officials in Massachusetts, where prosecutors said that Ali Jaafar, 63, of Watertown, Mass., was the \u201ctop individual lottery ticket casher\u201d in 2019. Mohamed Jaafar, 31, of Watertown and Waltham, Mass., ranked third that year, and Yousef Jaafar, 28, of Watertown was fourth.",
      "The Massachusetts State Lottery Commission temporarily suspended the three men from cashing lottery tickets, a decision that the Jaafars unsuccessfully challenged in Superior Court in Boston in 2019.",
      "\u201cI think it really speaks to a level of hubris,\u201d Mr. Sweeney said of their legal challenge. \u201cThis is not the result of somebody who\u2019s lucky or somebody who is, quote-unquote, playing a lot.\u201d",
      "Ali Jaafar and Mohamed Jaafar pleaded not guilty on Monday afternoon, appearing by videoconference in federal court in Boston. They had both been arrested earlier on Monday and were later released on their own recognizance. Their lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "It was not immediately clear whether Yousef Jaafar was in custody. His lawyer also did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The lawyer who represented the Jaafars in their previous civil action against the lottery commission declined to comment on Monday.",
      "A spokeswoman for the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts did not immediately comment further on the case.",
      "In Massachusetts, before someone can cash in a winning ticket that exceeds $600 in value, lottery officials will check to see if that person owes any unpaid state and federal taxes or child support.",
      "To avoid having their prize money garnished, lottery officials said, people will sometimes sell their winning tickets to someone else to cash in with the lottery commission. The person cashing in the ticket will keep 10 percent or 20 percent of the winnings in a scheme known as 10 percenting.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re trying to beat the system,\u201d Mr. Sweeney said.",
      "In the indictment, federal prosecutors said that Ali Jaafar had paid less than $24,500 in federal taxes on $15 million in lottery winnings, and that he had received $886,261 in tax refunds for bogus gambling losses from 2011 to 2019.",
      "Prosecutors said that Mohamed Jaafar had paid less than $21,700 in federal taxes on $3.3 million in lottery winnings, and that he had received $106,032 in tax refunds for phony gambling losses from 2012 to 2019.",
      "Yousef Jaafar paid less than $10,700 on $2.4 million in lottery winnings and received $185,951 in tax refunds for fictitious gambling losses from 2013 to 2019, according to the indictment.",
      "They were charged with one count each of conspiracy to defraud the United States, and money laundering conspiracy. Ali Jaafar and Mohamed Jaafar were each charged with five counts of filing false tax returns, while Yousef Jaafar was charged with three counts of filing false tax returns.",
      "Under state lottery rules in Massachusetts, a person who claims 20 or more prizes of at least $1,000 in one year is subject to a review by the director of the lottery. If the lottery director determines that it was statistically \u201cimprobable\u201d for the person to have won so many times, officials said, the person can receive a 90-day suspension from claiming prizes that exceed $600. A second violation can result in a 180-day suspension, and a third violation can result in a one-year ban.",
      "Mr. Sweeney said that the lottery commission had taken administrative action against the Jaafars and had referred the matter to law enforcement. He said that other similar criminal cases involving lottery fraud were continuing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s safe to assume,\u201d he said, \u201cthere are more shoes to drop.\u201d"

      "A draft report on a much-ridiculed review of the 2020 election results in Arizona\u2019s largest county has been delayed by a Covid-19 outbreak on the team preparing the analysis, the Republican president of the Arizona State Senate said on Monday.",
      "The president, Senator Karen Fann, said in a statement that three people on the five-member team were \u201cquite sick,\u201d including Doug Logan, the chief executive of the Florida-based company, Cyber Ninjas, that is in charge of the review.",
      "A portion of the draft was still set to be delivered to Ms. Fann on Monday, but the remainder will await the recovery of the three team members. Lawyers for the State Senate will begin reviewing the partial draft on Wednesday, Ms. Fann said, and more meetings will be required before the findings of the review are made public.",
      "The statement offered no hint of the contents of the partial draft. Mr. Logan and others involved in the review have previously claimed to have found irregularities in the official results of the November balloting, only to see those allegations debunked by election officials.",
      "Mr. Logan\u2019s company began reviewing 2.1 million ballots and election equipment from Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, in April on orders of the Republican majority in the State Senate. Ms. Fann has said that the review was conducted to address claims of voter fraud by supporters of former President Donald J. Trump, though no evidence of widespread fraud exists. She has also said that President Biden\u2019s narrow victories in both the county and the state would remain official regardless of the findings.",
      "Ms. Fann and other supporters of the review have argued that it was thorough and nonpartisan. But a range of election experts and the Republican-led leadership of Maricopa County have denounced the exercise from the beginning, citing haphazard rules for handling and counting ballots as well as lax security.",
      "Supporters\u2019 claims of an impartial review have been broadly dismissed. Mr. Logan spread conspiracy theories of a rigged election in Arizona on Twitter last year; his firm recruited volunteer workers for the review through Republican organizations; and virtually the entire cost of the exercise has been shouldered by conservative groups supporting Mr. Trump.",
      "On Monday, Ms. Fann said the draft report had been further delayed because images of mail-ballot envelopes that had been demanded from Maricopa County election officials were delivered only on Thursday. A final report will be released, she said, only after a final meeting \u201cto continue checking for accuracy, clarity and proof of documentation of findings.\u201d"

    "content": [
      "In the early days of the pandemic, scientists reported a reassuring trait in the new coronavirus: It appeared to be very stable. The virus was not mutating very rapidly, making it an easier target for treatments and vaccines.",
      "At the time, the slow mutation rate struck one young scientist as odd. \u201cThat really made my ears perk up,\u201d said Alina Chan, a postdoctoral fellow at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass. Dr. Chan wondered whether the new virus was somehow \u201cpre-adapted\u201d to thrive in humans, before the outbreak even started.",
      "\u201cBy the time the SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected in Wuhan in late 2019, it looked like it had already picked up the mutations it needed to be very good at spreading among humans,\u201d Dr. Chan said. \u201cIt was already good to go.\u201d",
      "The hypothesis, widely disputed by other scientists, was the foundation for an explosive paper posted online in May 2020, in which Dr. Chan and her colleagues questioned the prevailing consensus that the lethal virus had naturally spilled over to humans from bats through an intermediary host animal.",
      "The question she helped put on the table has not gone away. In late May, President Biden, dissatisfied by an equivocal report he had received on the subject, asked U.S. intelligence services to dig deeper into the origins question. The new report is due any day now.",
      "In last year\u2019s paper, Dr. Chan and her colleagues speculated that perhaps the virus had crossed over into humans and been circulating undetected for months while accumulating mutations.",
      "Perhaps, they said, the virus was already well adapted to humans while in bats or some other animal. Or maybe it adapted to humans while being studied in a lab, and had accidentally leaked out.",
      "Dr. Chan soon found herself in the middle of a maelstrom. An article in The Mail On Sunday, a British tabloid, ran with the headline: \u201cCoronavirus did NOT come from animals in the Wuhan market.\u201d",
      "Many senior virologists criticized her work and dismissed it out of hand, saying she did not have the expertise to speak on the subject, that she was maligning their specialty and that her statements would alienate China, hampering any future investigations.",
      "Some called her a conspiracy theorist. Others dismissed her ideas because she is a postdoctoral fellow, a junior scientist. One virologist, Benjamin Neuman, called her hypothesis \u201cgoofy.\u201d",
      "A Chinese news outlet accused her of \u201cfilthy behavior and a lack of basic academic ethics,\u201d and readers piled on that she was a \u201crace-traitor,\u201d because of her Chinese ancestry.",
      "\u201cThere were days and weeks when I was extremely afraid, and many days I didn\u2019t sleep,\u201d Dr. Chan, 32, said in a recent interview at an outdoor cafe, not far from the Broad Institute.",
      "Dr. Chan\u2019s story is a reflection of how deeply polarizing questions about the origins of the virus have become. The vast majority of scientists think it originated in bats, and was transmitted to humans through an intermediate host animal, though none has been identified.",
      "Some of them believe that a lab accident, specifically at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China, cannot be discounted and has not been adequately investigated. And a few think that the institute\u2019s research, which involved harvesting bats and bat coronaviruses from the wild, may have played a role.",
      "It is an acrid debate. In May, 18 scientists, including Dr. Chan, published a letter calling for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus. In July, a group of 21 virologists \u2014 including one who had signed the May letter \u2014 posted a paper compiling the evidence for an animal source, saying there was \u201cno evidence\u201d of a laboratory origin.",
      "Scientists on all sides say they have been threatened with violence and have faced name-calling for their positions. The attacks were so fierce that Dr. Chan worried for her personal safety and started taking new precautions, wondering if she was being followed and varying her daily routines.",
      "The backlash made her fear that she had put her professional future in jeopardy, and she wrote a letter to her boss, in which she apologized and offered her resignation.",
      "\u201cI thought I had committed career suicide, not just for me but for the whole group that wrote the paper,\u201d Dr. Chan said. \u201cI thought I had done a huge disservice to everybody, getting us mired in this controversy.\u201d",
      "But Dr. Chan\u2019s boss, Benjamin E. Deverman, who was a co-author on the paper, refused to accept her resignation, saying only that they had been na\u00efve not to anticipate the heated reaction.",
      "Dr. Chan\u2019s role has been so contentious that many scientists declined to discuss her at all. One of the few virologists who was willing to comment flatly dismissed the possibility of a lab leak.",
      "\u201cI believe there is no way the virus was genetically modified or person-made,\u201d said Susan Weiss, co-director of the Penn Center for Research on Coronaviruses and Other Emerging Pathogens at University of Pennsylvania, who also dismissed the possibility that the virus may have accidentally escaped the lab. \u201cIt is clearly zoonotic, from bats.\u201d",
      "Others said Dr. Chan was brave to put alternative hypotheses on the table.",
      "\u201cAlina Chan deserves the credit for challenging the conventional narrative and asking this question,\u201d said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University. \u201cIt is not easy for a junior scientist to openly challenge an established narrative.\u201d",
      "(Dr. Iwasaki also credited a loose group of internet sleuths who go by the acronym DRASTIC.)",
      "\u201cThe degree to which the origin question became so inflammatory and polarized is mind-boggling,\u201d Dr. Iwasaki said. \u201cThe fact is, we don\u2019t know exactly where the virus came from, period. It was important to point that out.\u201d",
      "As she sipped unsweetened ice tea and chatted about her ideas recently, Dr. Chan seemed an unlikely provocateur. She insisted that she was still on the fence about the virus\u2019s origins, torn \u201c50-50\u201d between the natural route and lab accident hypotheses.",
      "No scientific journal ever published her paper. Determined to draw the attention to what she considered a critical question that had to be answered in order to prevent a future pandemic, Dr. Chan took to Twitter, mastering the art of tutorial threads and gathering followers.",
      "She is now in \u201cworse shape\u201d than before, Dr. Chan said: \u201cNow I\u2019m getting attacked from both sides. The scientists are still attacking me, and the lab leak proponents are attacking me, too, because I won\u2019t go all the way and say it\u2019s from a lab. I keep telling them I can\u2019t, because there is no evidence.\u201d",
      "Critics say Dr. Chan bears some responsibility for the backlash.",
      "Early last year on Twitter, she appeared to accuse scientists and editors \u201cwho are directly or indirectly covering up severe research integrity issues surrounding the key SARS-2-like viruses to stop and think,\u201d adding, \u201cIf your actions obscure SARS2 origins, you\u2019re playing a hand in the death of millions of people.\u201d (She subsequently deleted the tweet.)",
      "Lab-leak proponents \u2014 who have called her \u201can apologist\u201d for virologists \u2014 have also been irked by the fact that Dr. Chan received so much credit for putting the question on the public agenda.",
      "Scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology said in early 2020 that they had found a virus in their database whose genome sequence was 96.2 percent similar to that of SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus.",
      "But it was internet sleuths and scientists who discovered that the virus matched one harvested in a cave linked to a pneumonia outbreak in 2012 that killed three miners \u2014 and that the Wuhan lab\u2019s genomic database of bat coronaviruses was taken offline in late 2019.",
      "Dr. Chan also landed a deal with Harper Collins, for an undisclosed amount, to co-author a book with Matt Ridley, a best-selling but controversial science writer who has been criticized for downplaying the seriousness of climate change.",
      "She denies accusations that she is writing the book for financial gain, saying she simply wants a complete record of the facts that will last longer than a Twitter feed. She plans to donate the proceeds to a Covid-related charity.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t need money and frills,\u201d she said.",
      "Dr. Chan was born in Vancouver, but her parents returned to their native Singapore when she was an infant. She was a teen when the SARS epidemic hit there.",
      "\u201cPeople were dying of SARS, and it was nonstop on TV,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI was 15, and it really stuck with me. There were pictures of body bags in hospital hallways.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen Covid started, many people in Boston thought it was no big deal, that flu is worse,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018This is serious business.\u2019\u201d",
      "She returned to Canada after high school, studying biochemistry and molecular biology at University of British Columbia, and completing a Ph.D. in medical genetics. By age 25, she was a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard, and then she took a position working for Dr. Deverman, who is the director of the vector engineering research group at the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute of M.I.T. and Harvard.",
      "Dr. Chan is \u201cinsightful, incredibly determined and apparently fearless,\u201d Dr. Deverman said, and she has an uncanny ability \u201cto synthesize large amounts of complex information, distill all of the details down to the most critical points and then communicate them in easy to understand language.\u201d",
      "A self-described workaholic, Dr. Chan married a fellow scientist during a break at an academic research conference a few years ago.",
      "\u201cWe took the morning off and went to city hall and came back to the conference, and my boss asked, \u2018Where were you?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI was like, \u2018I got married.\u2019 I don\u2019t even have a ring. My mother is horrified.\u201d",
      "She remains equivocal about the origins of the virus. \u201cI\u2019m leaning toward the lab leak theory now, but there are also days when I seriously consider that it could be from nature,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cOn those days, I feel mostly really, really sorry for the scientists who are implicated as possible sources for the virus,\u201d she said.",
      "Referring to Shi Zhengli, the top Chinese virologist who leads the research on emerging infectious diseases at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Dr. Chan said, \u201cI feel really sad for her situation. The stakes could not be higher.\u201d"

      "SACRAMENTO \u2014 For a generation, Larry Elder has been an AM radio fixture for millions of Californians, the voice they could count on when they were fed up with liberal Democratic politics. Undocumented immigrants? Deport them. Affirmative action? End it. Equal pay? The glass ceiling doesn\u2019t exist.",
      "Now Mr. Elder, a Los Angeles Republican who bills himself as \u201cthe sage from South Central,\u201d could end up as the next governor of the nation\u2019s most populous state. As the campaign to recall Gov. Gavin Newsom has become a dead heat among likely voters, Mr. Elder has emerged almost overnight as the front-runner in the campaign to replace him.",
      "Fueled by a combination of arcane recall rules, name recognition and partisan desperation, his rise to the top of a pack of some four dozen challengers has stunned and unnerved many in both parties.",
      "Democrats call him the agent of a far-right power grab. Republican rivals say he is an inexperienced, debate-dodging opportunist. Orrin Heatlie, the retired sheriff\u2019s sergeant who is the recall\u2019s lead proponent, said he and his fellow activists were voting for someone else.",
      "This month, The Sacramento Bee and two Republican candidates \u2014 Kevin Faulconer, the former San Diego mayor, and Caitlyn Jenner, the television personality and former Olympian \u2014 demanded that Mr. Elder drop out of the race after an ex-girlfriend of his said he brandished a gun at her while high on marijuana during a 2015 breakup.",
      "\u201cWe were having a conversation and he walked to the drawer and took out a .45 and checked to see that it was loaded,\u201d Alexandra Datig, 51, said in an interview. Ms. Datig, who worked as an escort in the 1990s and now runs Front Page Index, a conservative website, said: \u201cHe wanted me to know he was ready to be very threatening to me. He\u2019s a talented entertainer, but he shouldn\u2019t be governor.\u201d",
      "Mr. Elder, 69, did not respond to requests for comment about Ms. Datig\u2019s claims, but he did tweet that he has \u201cnever brandished a gun at anyone,\u201d adding, \u201cI am not going to dignify this with a response.\u201d",
      "The onslaught has come as a Sept. 14 election deadline nears. Ballots have been mailed to all active registered voters, asking whether the governor should be replaced, and, if so, by whom.",
      "Constitutional scholars say Mr. Elder\u2019s sudden ascent is an example of all that is wrong with the recall process, which requires a majority to recall a governor but only a plurality of votes for the replacement candidate to win. With 46 challengers on the ballot, 49.9 percent of the electorate could vote to keep Mr. Newsom, and he could still lose to a replacement who is supported by only a tiny sliver of voters. Polls show a rout by Mr. Newsom among all Californians but a far tighter race among likely voters, 20 percent of whom favor Mr. Elder.",
      "Mr. Newsom, whose fate rides on turnout, has made a foil of Mr. Elder, a \u201csmall-l libertarian\u201d who reliably agitates the governor\u2019s base with claims, for instance, that the minimum wage should be zero, the \u201cwar on oil\u201d should be ended and racial preferences are destructive.",
      "\u201cThe leading candidate thinks climate change is a hoax, believes we need more offshore oil drilling, more fracking, does not believe a woman has the right to choose, actually came out against Roe v. Wade, does not believe in a minimum wage,\u201d Mr. Newsom has told supporters.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t paint me as some wild-eyed radical,\u201d Mr. Elder said in a recent interview. \u201cI\u2019m running because of crime, homelessness, the rising cost of living and the outrageous decisions made during Covid that shut down the state.\u201d",
      "To his loyal listeners, Mr. Elder paints himself as the native son of a California that was once simpler and safer than the teeming, disaster-prone nation-state he sees anchoring the West Coast today. Listeners know that his father, a former U.S. Marine, saved his pay as a janitor to open a restaurant in Los Angeles\u2019s Pico-Union district, and to buy a house in a neighborhood that shifted from mostly white to mostly Black residents in less than a decade.",
      "His father was also violently abusive, Mr. Elder wrote in 2018, driving him to leave home the moment he graduated from Crenshaw High School. Admitted to Brown University under an early affirmative action program, Mr. Elder, the second of three sons, stayed away from California for years, moving on to the University of Michigan Law School and becoming a lawyer and legal recruiter in Ohio.",
      "He was a guest on a Cleveland PBS show when the stand-in host, the Los Angeles-based conservative talk radio host Dennis Prager, suggested he come back.",
      "\u201cI was so impressed with his original mind and phenomenal grasp of the issues that when I returned to Los Angeles I invited him onto my show \u2014 solely in order to persuade the KABC station manager to hire him,\u201d Mr. Prager wrote in an email.",
      "It was the age of Rush Limbaugh, and Mr. Elder rose swiftly. Los Angeles progressives boycotted his advertisers, but he hung on, writing books, making Fox News appearances and expanding through syndication until 2014, when the station abruptly fired him. Another station soon picked him up; Salem Media Group has syndicated his show since 2016 and is holding his slot while he campaigns.",
      "\u201cI have never, ever, ever, ever thought I would be entering politics,\u201d Mr. Elder said. But he was persuaded, he said, by Mr. Prager, Jack Hibbs, the evangelical pastor of Calvary Chapel Chino Hills, and a host of others including radio colleagues, his barber and his dry cleaner.",
      "\u201cI kept waiting for somebody to say, \u2018Are you kidding?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut nobody said that. People said: \u2018If not you, who? If not now, when?\u2019\u201d",
      "Mr. Elder\u2019s political positions speak loudly and clearly to the state\u2019s small but vocal strain of far-right conservatism. He supports school vouchers and prioritizes jobs over environmental and climate considerations. He opposes abortion. He is vaccinated against the coronavirus because of a rare blood condition but opposes vaccine and mask \u201cmandates.\u201d",
      "And, G.O.P. consultants note, Mr. Elder is among a handful of California Republicans with enough name recognition to compete in a state of almost 40 million people.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been a listener of his for years,\u201d said Shelby Nicole Owens, 35, a Republican in the rural community of Sonora who admired Mr. Elder\u2019s consistency and \u201ccommon-sense approach\u201d long before her ballot arrived in her mailbox.",
      "\u201cDone and done!\u201d she posted on his Facebook page, adding a kiss-blowing emoji after marking her vote.",
      "But establishment Republicans such as Mr. Faulconer say he is more suited to provocation than to governing.",
      "While other candidates disclosed their income taxes, Mr. Elder supplied partial returns and then successfully challenged the state requirement, keeping his private.",
      "After incomplete conflict-of-interest disclosures \u2014 now being investigated by state campaign finance regulators \u2014 were amended, they showed that Mr. Elder is being paid by The Epoch Times, a purveyor of political misinformation and far-right conspiracy theories.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. Capitol Police announced on Monday that they had cleared a lieutenant who fatally shot a rioter inside the Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack, after an extensive investigation found that he acted lawfully and potentially saved lawmakers and aides from serious harm or death.",
      "The department\u2019s decision to formally close the case followed a determination in April by the Justice Department that charges against the officer were not warranted in the shooting death of Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran, on Jan. 6. Ms. Babbitt was among a throng of Trump supporters that began smashing its way through the entrance to the Speaker\u2019s Lobby, a hallway just off the House floor, while officers were evacuating lawmakers from the chamber.",
      "According to video of the encounter, as people in the mob shattered the lobby\u2019s glass doors, Ms. Babbitt tried to climb through a hole in the glass and a police lieutenant on the other side fired a single shot, hitting her in the left shoulder. After being taken to a hospital, she died.",
      "\u201cThe actions of the officer in this case potentially saved members and staff from serious injury and possible death from a large crowd of rioters,\u201d the Capitol Police said Monday, noting lawmakers were just \u201csteps away.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf the doors were breached, the rioters would have immediate access to the House chambers,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Ms. Babbitt was one of five people who died during the assault on the Capitol and in its immediate aftermath. She has become a martyrlike figure for some on the far right.",
      "Capitol Police investigators \u201cdetermined the officer\u2019s conduct was lawful and within department policy, which says an officer may use deadly force only when the officer reasonably believes that action is in the defense of human life, including the officer\u2019s own life, or in the defense of any person in immediate danger of serious physical injury,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The agency said it would not be identifying the lieutenant because the officer and the officer\u2019s family \u201chave been the subject of numerous credible and specific threats for actions that were taken as part of the job of all our officers: defending the Congress, members, staff and the democratic process.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers have credited the Capitol Police officer who shot Ms. Babbitt with saving their lives, but increasingly some on the far right have sought to inflame their base over the shooting.",
      "One House Republican, Representative Paul Gosar of Arizona \u2014 who has a history of associating with extremists and white nationalists \u2014 accused the officer of \u201clying in wait\u201d to carry out an \u201cexecution.\u201d",
      "Former President Donald J. Trump has questioned the shooting and why the name of the officer who shot Ms. Babbitt was not released.",
      "He released a statement this month in which he said Ms. Babbitt was \u201cmurdered at the hands of someone who should never have pulled the trigger of his gun.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe know who he is,\u201d Mr. Trump said.",
      "Ms. Babbitt\u2019s husband has sued to force the release of investigative files related to the shooting, and her family has threatened to seek damages from the Capitol Police for her killing.",
      "The Capitol Police department, like Congress, is not subject to public records requests.",
      "Mark E. Schamel, a lawyer who represents the Capitol Police lieutenant, said his client is a \u201cdecorated veteran\u201d who showed \u201ctremendous restraint in firing just one shot.\u201d He said the lieutenant was \u201cnothing short of heroic\u201d as he organized and coordinated the defense of the House on Jan. 6.",
      "\u201cHis willingness to remain steadfast in the face of hundreds of violent, extremist, would-be insurrectionists intent on thwarting Congress from performing its constitutional duty was the type of heroism and commitment that the lieutenant has demonstrated in his almost three decades of law enforcement service,\u201d Mr. Schamel said. \u201cThe lieutenant\u2019s conduct saved lives and helped to end the violent insurrection.\u201d"

      "\u2014 Katharine K. Wilkinson, a co-editor of the climate anthology \u201cAll We Can Save\u201d",
      "The world\u2019s leading climate scientists issued a landmark report this month with their clearest clarion call to date: The climate crisis is here, it\u2019s humanity\u2019s fault, and it\u2019s a catastrophic, planet-threatening problem that will only get worse before it gets better \u2014 if it gets better.",
      "The United Nations report, approved by 195 governments and based on more than 14,000 studies, determined that more than a century of extractive energy use has heated the planet by roughly 1.1 degrees Celsius, or 2 degrees Fahrenheit. Because of existing emissions, additional warming over the next three decades is inevitable. But the report stressed that the coming years offered a narrow and urgent window of opportunity: the chance to fundamentally change our consumption habits and energy usage to avoid even more disastrous warming.",
      "Katharine K. Wilkinson, a co-editor of the climate anthology \u201cAll We Can Save,\u201d argues that while climate change is a collective problem, its impacts will be disproportionate \u2014 skewed in its effects on the world\u2019s most vulnerable populations, specifically women and girls.",
      "\u201cThe climate crisis is not gender-equal or gender-neutral,\u201d she said. Men have a larger carbon footprint than women, by 16 percent, according to one study. And the top 1 percent of income earners globally, who are overwhelmingly male, are responsible for more carbon emissions than the bottom 50 percent of earners. According to the U.N., that\u2019s roughly 70 million at the top compared with 3.5 billion at the bottom. Yet it is women and girls who bear the burdens in the wake of more frequent climate disasters. Those burdens include displacement \u2014 80 percent of people displaced by climate change are women \u2014 as well as increased homelessness, poverty, sexual violence and disease.",
      "In her book, Dr. Wilkinson, who has a doctorate in geography and environment from Oxford, and her co-editor, Ayana Elizabeth Johnson, shine a spotlight on the many women researching, leading, campaigning and writing on climate solutions.",
      "In Her Words spoke with Dr. Wilkinson about why the answers are inextricable from gender equality and explained the idea of climate feminism. The conversation has been condensed and lightly edited.",
      "You say the climate crisis is having a disproportionate impact on women. What does that mean?",
      "The Pentagon coined this term of climate as a threat multiplier, which, of course, they\u2019re thinking about national security. But I think it\u2019s such a helpful framing that the climate is a multiplier of any cracks, imbalances or injustices that are present in current society. It amplifies them.",
      "The climate crisis is not gender-neutral in its root causes, which grow out of patriarchy, among other things. It is not gender-neutral in its impacts because women and girls are on the back foot, in various ways. Extreme weather events are being tied to early marriage, to sex trafficking, to domestic violence, all of these things that are already present in society that get turned up a notch or five.",
      "Say more about the connection between climate change and patriarchy.",
      "The cause of climate change is greenhouse gas emissions. But to me, the question is, well, why do we have such an abundance of these emissions, and why have they been so hard to rein in? And when we start to ask those questions, we find ourselves confronting a system that has been very focused on hierarchy, control, exploitation and, frankly, decision making that has largely sat with a relatively narrow set of folks. And, certainly, women have not been at the table anywhere near equally in shaping the status quo that we find ourselves in. And the same is true for people of color. The same is true for Indigenous peoples.",
      "How is gender connected to climate solutions?",
      "We talk so much in climate about solutions at scale, which we need. We need regenerative agriculture around the world. We need a 100 percent clean electricity system, we need means of mobility that don\u2019t rely on fossil fuels. We need all of that, of course. But I think sometimes we overlook the values. Because we\u2019re not just trying to build a zero-emissions future, right? We\u2019re trying to build a future also in which we can thrive together.",
      "And to me, patriarchy is fundamentally predicated on some people thriving at the expense of other people. And of course, the same is true of white supremacy. Addressing both of those things is at the heart of climate work.",
      "In your book, you describe the need for climate leadership that is more \u201ccharacteristically feminine.\u201d Tell me more about that.",
      "Sherri Mitchell, an Indigenous attorney, activist and author from the Penobscot Nation, talks about the feminine as heart-centered wisdom and the masculine as action in the world.",
      "When we think about the things it\u2019s going to take to address the climate crisis and build a genuinely life-giving future, that\u2019s going to take a fundamental reorientation to care. It\u2019s going to take collaboration, connection, compassion, creativity, all of these things that fall within this realm of the feminine, regardless of gender identity.",
      "Can you give an example of an area where you would like to see this reorientation manifested?",
      "When we look at climate philanthropy, there are still really significant imbalances along the lines of race and gender. Most of the money that\u2019s being invested in the climate movement is going to work that is led by white men. And we want them on the team. They just can\u2019t be the whole team.",
      "How would you respond to someone who says that bold climate action is inherently anticapitalist?",
      "If capitalism is not anticlimate, the onus for proving that is on capitalists who so far have come up beyond short in showing how it can be workable within our planetary system. We have had this very bizarre, fundamental belief in infinity at the core of this economic system, and we\u2019re living on a finite planet, so if you think that there is a way to solve for infinite growth on a finite planet, I would love to see that mapped out.",
      "How do you hope the movement for climate feminism will evolve?",
      "I think a lot about how we welcome in people who are committed feminists but have not seen themselves as climate feminists or have felt like the climate space is not super welcoming. Like, if you don\u2019t have a Ph.D. in atmospheric science, then thanks, we don\u2019t need you. And of course, that couldn\u2019t be couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. If you\u2019re going to be a feminist on a hot planet, you have to be a climate feminist.",
      "If someone came to you and asked what steps they could take now to address the climate emergency, what would you tell them?",
      "I often ask people: What are your superpowers, and how can those be contributed in some way to the work that needs doing on climate? Because we are so much more than our consumer choices, we are so much more even than our voting practices and civic participation. Many of us can find ways to weave climate into our professional lives. And that, for me, is when things start to get powerful.",

    "title": "Where Is the Anti-Biden Tea Party?",
    "content": [
      "Barack Obama had been president for only a few months when the Tea Party roared onto the American political scene. Conservative activists rallied and organized by the hundreds of thousands against his economic stimulus plan and health care reforms. Their efforts torqued the Republican Party rightward and powered its gains in the 2010 midterm election.",
      "Eight years later, Donald J. Trump faced a similar grass-roots opposition. The liberal \u201cresistance\u201d protested and organized in thousands of volunteer-led local groups, helping sink Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and helping Democrats retake the House of Representatives in 2018.",
      "Yet more than halfway through President Biden\u2019s first year in office, there is little sign of a mass movement mobilizing against him or his policies. Even as the administration calls for trillions of dollars in federal spending, no second coming of the Tea Party has taken root. And the protests by conservatives that have taken place \u2014 although sometimes aggressive in new ways \u2014 have largely targeted an array of political and cultural issues rather than Mr. Biden himself.",
      "\u201cYeah, we go out, we oppose some of Biden\u2019s policies, we disagree,\u201d said Debbie Dooley, an Atlanta-based activist who helped found the Tea Party in 2009. \u201cBut you don\u2019t see great protests out there.\u201d",
      "The number of conservative demonstrations nationwide since the Biden inauguration remains a fraction of the volume of liberal demonstrations that followed the Trump inauguration in 2017, according to data collected by the Crowd Counting Consortium, a public interest and scholarly project directed by the researchers Erica Chenoweth of Harvard and Jeremy Pressman of the University of Connecticut.",
      "Where left-of-center demonstrations made up three-quarters of all demonstrations in the United States during the six months after Mr. Trump entered office, conservative demonstrations account for just 10 percent of the total since Mr. Biden did (protests against racism and policing have accounted for the majority). And at only a few dozen of them have protesters explicitly criticized Mr. Biden, according to the crowd counts, in contrast to the hundreds of Obama-critical Tea Party events held by the summer of 2009.",
      "Why has Mr. Biden \u2014 at least so far \u2014 escaped the sort of grass-roots ferment that dogged his two immediate predecessors?",
      "One possibility is that he\u2019s simply perceived as less antagonizing. The Tea Party was driven more by anxiety and resentment over a demographically changing country that had just elected its first Black president, most political scientists agree, than by fiscal conservatism.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it was just Obama personally; it was what he represented,\u201d said Theda Skocpol, a Harvard political scientist who has studied both the Tea Party and the anti-Trump resistance. \u201cIt\u2019s the sense that people that don\u2019t seem like America to you are taking charge.\u201d",
      "As a white man, Mr. Biden attracts less of this racial backlash. And where Mr. Trump\u2019s personal behavior and pugnacious political style stoked liberal activists\u2019 outrage, Mr. Biden\u2019s lower-key, more moderate reputation may offer less of a target.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not been as easy to fuel a sort of second Tea Party with him in the White House simply because he doesn\u2019t upset people as much,\u201d said Seth Masket, who directs the University of Denver\u2019s Center on American Politics and wrote a book about why Mr. Biden won last year\u2019s Democratic primary.",
      "Mr. Biden\u2019s agenda offers another possibility. Polls consistently show that his pandemic relief package and infrastructure plans are viewed more favorably than Mr. Obama\u2019s 2009 stimulus and the Affordable Care Act ever were, and more favorably than Mr. Trump\u2019s A.C.A. repeal plans and 2017 tax law. All four of those bills sparked grass-roots opposition.",
      "But a president who dampens rather than stokes grass-roots furor is only part of the answer. The subjects conservatives have been protesting about over the past six months suggest other reasons for the missing anti-Biden Tea Party.",
      "One of them is the pandemic. Protests against public health restrictions, masks and Covid vaccines account for a large number of conservative demonstrations since Mr. Biden\u2019s inauguration, according to data collected by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, a nonprofit group that tracks demonstration events in more than 190 countries and territories. In many cases, those demonstrations have criticized governors, employers and public health officials rather than Mr. Biden.",
      "The pandemic \u2014 coupled with large deficit spending under Mr. Trump \u2014 may also have shielded Mr. Biden\u2019s ambitious agenda from the sort of conservative criticism that greeted government spending in 2009.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re still concerned about a lot of the fiscal issues,\u201d said Ms. Dooley, the Tea Party activist. \u201cBut then Covid struck, and that just turned everything upside down because you\u2019ve got people out there that are hurting and you\u2019ve got to help them.\u201d",
      "The transformation of the Republican Party since 2009 offers another possible explanation. The rise of the Tea Party \u201cmarked the beginning of a mainstreaming of right-wing resentment politics\u201d that helped pave the way for Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, said Rachel Blum, a political scientist at the University of Oklahoma.",
      "Its very success in remaking the G.O.P. might have made a new grass-roots resurgence on the right unnecessary. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t need to be another Tea Party because Trumpism is the downstream\u201d representation of it, Professor Skocpol said. \u201cTrump is leading himself, front and center, a much more personality-centered embodiment of the same urges.\u201d Where Mr. Obama commanded activist attention in 2009, the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project has documented more than four times as many pro-Trump demonstrations as anti-Biden ones through July 20.",
      "In some cases, Mr. Trump\u2019s influence has fueled opposition to fellow Republicans rather than against Democrats. \u201cA lot of the anger is focused on Republicans that betrayed Trump, that threw Trump under the bus,\u201d Ms. Dooley said, mentioning Representative Liz Cheney, Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia and the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell. \u201cThat\u2019s what a lot of people are focused on versus 2009.\u201d",
      "Trump-aligned Republicans are certainly emulating the Tea Party in some ways: transforming local party committees, taking over school boards and running for office. A recent surge of protests against critical race theory has drawn comparisons to the Tea Party, although the number of demonstrations so far has been far smaller.",
      "Not having a Biden-era version of the Tea Party may not hurt Republicans much politically. The party needs to flip only a handful of seats next year to retake Congress. Biden\u2019s approval rating has fallen in recent weeks, and the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan may depress it further. And a broad grass-roots backlash could emerge if Mr. Biden\u2019s legislative agenda becomes less popular.",
      "It\u2019s also possible that the Trump era has changed the tactics and goals of conservative organizing. Although some Tea Party events featured guns and violent language, the movement influenced the political process largely by protesting, pressuring lawmakers on legislative issues and voting. By contrast, some Trump-supporting activists have resorted to implicit threats (like armed anti-lockdown demonstrations), conspiracy theories (like QAnon and false claims about the 2020 election) or outright violence (like the Jan. 6 attack on Congress).",
      "\u201cThe messaging is very much not about\u201d using the traditional tools of grass-roots organizing, \u201clike going to town hall meetings and contacting your elected officials,\u201d said Dana Fisher, a University of Maryland sociologist. \u201cThis is more like intimidating your elected officials by packing assault rifles.\u201d",
      "Far-right militant groups whose members participated in the Capitol attack, like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, have taken part in more than 300 events (some peaceful) in the six-month period after Mr. Biden\u2019s inauguration, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project. And sizable shares of Republicans have downplayed or excused the events of Jan. 6. In a Quinnipiac poll this month, 75 percent of them said it was \u201ctime to move on.\u201d More than half of Trump voters described the riot as \u201cpatriotism\u201d and \u201cdefending freedom\u201d in a July CBS News/YouGov poll.",
      "In some cases, the Tea Party has embodied this shift. One of its founding organizers spoke at the rally that preceded the Capitol attack. Local Tea Party groups that remain active have embraced Mr. Trump\u2019s election lies, Professor Skocpol said. And groups like FreedomWorks and the political arm of the Heritage Foundation, which boosted the Tea Party movement, are now pushing restrictive voting laws.",
      "That suggests that when the next sustained conservative grass-roots movement does erupt, Mr. Biden may not be its focus \u2014 and it may not look much like the Tea Party. \u201cWe\u2019re in uncharted waters in a lot of ways,\u201d Professor Fisher said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what we\u2019re going to get.\u201d"

    "content": [
      "Charlie Watts, whose strong but unflashy drumming powered the Rolling Stones for over 50 years, died on Tuesday in London. He was 80.",
      "His death, in a hospital, was announced by his publicist, Bernard Doherty. No other details were immediately provided.",
      "The Rolling Stones announced earlier this month that Mr. Watts would not be a part of the band\u2019s forthcoming \u201cNo Filter\u201d tour of the United States after he had undergone an unspecified emergency medical procedure, which the band\u2019s representatives said had been successful.",
      "Reserved, dignified and dapper, Mr. Watts was never as flamboyant, either onstage or off, as most of his rock-star peers, let alone the Stones\u2019 lead singer, Mick Jagger. He was content to be one of the finest rock drummers of his generation, playing with a jazz-inflected swing that made the band\u2019s titanic success possible. As the Stones guitarist Keith Richards said in his 2010 autobiography, \u201cLife,\u201d \u201cCharlie Watts has always been the bed that I lie on musically.\u201d",
      "While some rock drummers chased after volume and bombast, Mr. Watts defined his playing with subtlety, swing and a solid groove.",
      "\u201cAs much as Mick\u2019s voice and Keith\u2019s guitar, Charlie Watts\u2019s snare sound is the Rolling Stones,\u201d Bruce Springsteen wrote in an introduction to the 1991 edition of the drummer Max Weinberg\u2019s book \u201cThe Big Beat.\u201d \u201cWhen Mick sings, \u2018It\u2019s only rock \u2019n\u2019 roll but I like it,\u2019 Charlie\u2019s in back showing you why!\u201d",
      "Charles Robert Watts was born in London on June 2, 1941. His mother, the former Lillian Charlotte Eaves, was a homemaker; his father, Charles Richard Watts, was in the Royal Air Force and, after World War II, became a truck driver for British Railways.",
      "Charlie\u2019s first instrument was a banjo, but, baffled by the fingerings required to play it, he removed the neck and converted its body into a snare drum. He discovered jazz when he was 12 and soon became a fan of Miles Davis, Duke Ellington and Charles Mingus.",
      "By 1960, Mr. Watts had graduated from the Harrow School of Art and found work as a graphic artist for a London advertising agency. He wrote and illustrated \u201cOde to a Highflying Bird,\u201d a children\u2019s book about the jazz saxophonist Charlie Parker (although it was not published until 1965). In the evenings, he played drums with a variety of groups.",
      "Most of them were jazz combos, but he was also invited to join Alexis Korner\u2019s raucous rhythm-and-blues collective, Blues Incorporated. Mr. Watts declined the invitation because he was leaving England to work as a graphic designer in Scandinavia, but he joined the group when he returned a few months later.",
      "The newly formed Rolling Stones (then called the Rollin\u2019 Stones) knew they needed a good drummer but could not afford Mr. Watts, who was already drawing a regular salary from his various gigs. \u201cWe starved ourselves to pay for him!\u201d Mr. Richards wrote. \u201cLiterally. We went shoplifting to get Charlie Watts.\u201d",
      "In early 1963, when they could finally guarantee five pounds a week, Mr. Watts joined the band, completing the canonical lineup of Mr. Richards, Mr. Jagger, the guitarist Brian Jones, the bassist Bill Wyman and the pianist Ian Stewart. He moved in with his bandmates and immersed himself in Chicago blues records.",
      "In the wake of the Beatles\u2019 success, the Rolling Stones quickly climbed from being an electric-blues specialty act to one of the biggest bands in the British Invasion of the 1960s. While Mr. Richards\u2019s guitar riff defined the band\u2019s most famous single, the 1965 chart-topper \u201c(I Can\u2019t Get No) Satisfaction,\u201d Mr. Watts\u2019s drum pattern was just as essential. He was relentless on \u201cPaint It Black\u201d (No. 1 in 1966), supple on \u201cRuby Tuesday\u201d (No. 1 in 1967) and the master of a funky groove on \u201cHonky Tonk Women\u201d (No. 1 in 1969).",
      "Mr. Watts was ambivalent about the fame that he achieved as a member of the group that has often been called \u201cthe world\u2019s greatest rock \u2019n\u2019 roll band.\u201d As he said in the 2003 book \u201cAccording to the Rolling Stones\u201d: \u201cI loved playing with Keith and the band \u2014 I still do \u2014 but I wasn\u2019t interested in being a pop idol sitting there with girls screaming. It\u2019s not the world I come from. It\u2019s not what I wanted to be, and I still think it\u2019s silly.\u201d",
      "As the Stones rolled through the years, Mr. Watts drew on his graphic-arts background to contribute to the design of the band\u2019s stage sets, merchandise and album covers \u2014 he even contributed a comic strip to the back cover of their 1967 album \u201cBetween the Buttons.\u201d While the Stones cultivated bad-boy images and indulged a collective appetite for debauchery, Mr. Watts mostly eschewed the sex and drugs. He clandestinely married Shirley Ann Shepherd, an art-school student and sculptor, in 1964.",
      "On tour, he would go back to his hotel room alone; every night, he sketched his lodgings. \u201cI\u2019ve drawn every bed I\u2019ve slept in on tour since 1967,\u201d he told Rolling Stone magazine in 1996. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic nonbook.\u201d",
      "Similarly, while other members of the Stones battled for control of the band, Mr. Watts largely stayed out of the internal politics. As he told The Weekend Australian in 2014, \u201cI\u2019m usually mumbling in the background.\u201d",
      "Mr. Jones, who considered himself the leader, was fired from the Stones in 1969 (and found dead in his swimming pool soon after). Mr. Jagger and Mr. Richards spent decades at loggerheads, sometimes making albums without being in the studio at the same time. Mr. Watts was happy to work with either, or both.",
      "There was one time, however, when Mr. Watts famously chafed at being treated like a hired hand rather than an equal member of the group. In 1984, Mr. Jagger and Mr. Richards went out for a night of drinking in Amsterdam. When they returned to their hotel around 5 a.m., Mr. Jagger called Mr. Watts, waking him up, and asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s my drummer?\u201d Twenty minutes later, Mr. Watts showed up at Mr. Jagger\u2019s room, coldly furious, but shaved and elegantly dressed in a Savile Row suit and tie.",
      "\u201cNever call me your drummer again,\u201d he told Mr. Jagger, before grabbing him by the lapel and delivering a right hook. Mr. Richards said he narrowly saved Mr. Jagger from falling out a window into an Amsterdam canal.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not something I\u2019m proud of doing, and if I hadn\u2019t been drinking I would never have done it,\u201d Mr. Watts said in 2003. \u201cThe bottom line is, don\u2019t annoy me.\u201d",
      "At the time, Mr. Watts was in the early stages of a midlife crisis that manifested itself as a two-year bender. Just as the other Stones were settling into moderation in their 40s, he got hooked on amphetamines and heroin, nearly destroying his marriage. After passing out in a recording studio and breaking his ankle when he fell down a staircase, he quit, cold turkey.",
      "Mr. Watts and his wife had a daughter, Seraphina, in 1968 and, after spending some time in France as tax exiles, relocated to a farm in southwestern England. There they bred prizewinning Arabian horses, gradually expanding their stud farm to over 250 horses on 700 acres of land. Information on his survivors was not immediately available.  Mr. Doherty, the publicist, said Mr. Watts had \u201cpassed away peacefully\u201d in the hospital \u201csurrounded by his family.\u201d",
      "The Rolling Stones made 30 studio albums, nine of them topping the American charts and 10 topping the British charts. The band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 \u2014 a ceremony Mr. Watts skipped.",
      "Eventually the Stones settled into a cycle of releasing an album every four years, followed by an extremely lucrative world tour. (They grossed over a half-billion dollars between 2005 and 2007 on their \u201cBigger Bang\u201d tour.)",
      "But Mr. Watts\u2019s true love remained jazz, and he would fill the time between those tours with jazz groups of various sizes \u2014 the Charlie Watts Quintet, the Charlie Watts Tentet, the Charlie Watts Orchestra. Soon enough, though, he would be back on the road with the Stones, playing in sold-out arenas and sketching beds in empty hotel rooms.",
      "He was not slowed down by old age, or by a bout with throat cancer in 2004. In 2016, the drummer Lars Ulrich of Metallica told Billboard that since he wanted to keep playing into his 70s, he looked to Mr. Watts as his role model. \u201cThe only road map is Charlie Watts,\u201d he said.",
      "Through it all, Mr. Watts kept on keeping time on a simple four-piece drum kit, anchoring the spectacle of the Rolling Stones.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be a drummer,\u201d he told Rolling Stone in 1996, adding that during arena rock shows, he imagined a more intimate setting. \u201cI\u2019ve always had this illusion of being in the Blue Note or Birdland with Charlie Parker in front of me. It didn\u2019t sound like that, but that was the illusion I had.\u201d"

      "On Monday morning, the F.D.A. granted full approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for people 16 and up.",
      "It is the first vaccine to move beyond emergency-use status in the U.S., and officials hope it will persuade some of the 85 million unvaccinated Americans who are eligible for shots but have not received them.",
      "Data from 44,000 clinical trial participants in the United States, the European Union, Turkey, South Africa and South America showed the vaccine was 91 percent effective in preventing infection. So far, more than 92 million Americans \u2014 54 percent of those fully inoculated \u2014 have gotten Pfizer shots; most of the rest received Moderna\u2019s vaccine.",
      "The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will continue to be authorized for emergency use for children ages 12 to 15 while Pfizer collects the data required for full approval. Authorizing the vaccine for children younger than 12 could be at least several months away.",
      "The decision is expected to accelerate the pace of vaccine mandates from government agencies, universities, corporations and other organizations.",
      "President Biden, who has required all federal employees and on-site contractors to be immunized or submit to regular testing, urged corporate, state and local leaders to follow his lead. \u201cDo what I did last month. Require your employees to get vaccinated or face strict requirements,\u201d he said in a national address.",
      "Some experts also hope that the approval may convince people who are on the fence. A recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that three of every 10 unvaccinated people said that they would be more likely to get a shot that had been fully approved.",
      "Dr. Thomas Dobbs, the chief health officer for Mississippi, said the F.D.A. move would help \u201cshake loose this false assertion that the vaccines are an \u2018experimental\u2019 thing.\u201d",
      "Others were less optimistic. \u201cI think that is a vanishingly small number of people in real life,\u201d said Alison Buttenheim, an associate professor of nursing at the University of Pennsylvania and expert on vaccine hesitancy.",
      "More important, she said, would be the effect of requirements: \u201cMandates simplify things for people.\u201d",
      "As the Delta variant pushes cases skyward, hospitals are filling up: About one in four I.C.U.s across the country has at least 95 percent of beds occupied, according to a Times analysis.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a war zone. We are just barraged with patients and have nowhere to put them,\u201d said Cyndy O\u2019Brien, an emergency room nurse and patient care coordinator at Singing River, a small health system on the Gulf Coast of Mississippi.",
      "She arrived for work one day to find people sprawled out in their cars gasping for air as three ambulances with gravely ill patients idled in the parking lot.",
      "The problem is not just physical capacity. More than a year into the pandemic, hospitals are facing a critical nursing shortage, with potentially fatal consequences. Nearly 30 percent of Singing River\u2019s 500 beds are empty because of 169 unfilled nursing positions.",
      "Mississippi, which has the most new cases per capita in the U.S., has 2,000 fewer registered nurses than it did at the beginning of the year, according to the state\u2019s hospital association.",
      "Across the country, more than 1,200 nurses died from the virus during the pandemic. Now, the United States is enduring a fourth wave of infections, many nurses are angry, depleted and traumatized.",
      "Thousands have taken early retirement, left the profession or opted for less stressful nursing jobs at schools, summer camps and private doctor\u2019s offices.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re exhausted, both physically and emotionally,\u201d O\u2019Brien said, choking back tears.",
      "Last year, my son was safely tucked in at home learning online. This year he\u2019ll be in the classroom five days a week, even though cases are rising in our community. He\u2019s vaccinated and good about wearing the mask, but still we worry. And we\u2019re angry that schools aren\u2019t doing more to keep kids safe. Our strategy is to get through it and have as much fun as possible outside of school. It\u2019s going to be stressful. \u2014 Chrissy Gilbert, 50, Columbus, Ohio",
      "On Friday, for the next edition of \u201cOur Changing Lives,\u201d we plan to focus on the school year. We\u2019d love to hear from you. We may feature your response in an upcoming newsletter.",

      "VAN HORN, Texas \u2014 Like many other West Texas sheriffs, Oscar E. Carrillo packs a gun, drives a truck and wears a cowboy hat.",
      "But it is his newest piece of gear, a corpse trolley, that has him questioning whether to remain a lawman.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so we don\u2019t have to hand carry the remains anymore,\u201d Sheriff Carrillo, 56, explained as he described the list of dead migrants turning up on his watch. \u201cI used to request regular stuff like bulletproof vests,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I\u2019m asking for more body bags.\u201d",
      "As the number of migrants crossing the border with Mexico has surged this year, with encounters reaching levels not seen in more than two decades, so, too, has the number of bodies found by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Through July, Border Patrol officials found 383 dead migrants, the highest toll in nearly a decade, and one already far surpassing the 253 recovered in the previous fiscal year.",
      "There is no single system for tracking migrant deaths, some of which are not discovered for years, and the Border Patrol figure does not include the dozens of bodies found by other law enforcement agencies, such as local sheriff\u2019s offices.",
      "Sheriff Carrillo, for example, has found the bodies of 19 migrants this year, many who died because of the sweltering summer heat, up from two last year. He handles the cases, in addition to fighting day-to-day crimes like break-ins and cattle thefts, with just 10 deputies in Culberson County, a sparsely populated expanse of mountainous terrain, scrublands and sand dunes that is about three and a half times the size of Rhode Island.",
      "Some political leaders, like Gov. Greg Abbott, argue that more border-crossers are making the perilous journey after President Biden toned down the hostility his predecessor showed toward migrants from Latin America.",
      "Others lay blame on drug gangs and hunger in Central America, or the extreme weather fueled by climate change. While such factors are interrelated, for Culbertson County there is another element: the border wall.",
      "The signature project of the Trump administration has pushed some migrants to cross in exceptionally forbidding areas where no wall exists, like remote stretches around Culberson County.",
      "Sheriff Carrillo, who has held his job for 21 years, said he tried to avoid all the political skirmishing around immigration.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve got a job to do,\u201d the sheriff, who grew up in El Paso, said in an interview conducted entirely in Spanglish, the hybrid language prevailing along much of the border. He roughnecked in the Texas oil fields before the crash in oil prices in the 1980s.",
      "\u201cI told myself I need something that\u2019s going to be around,\u201d he said, \u201clike law enforcement or funeral work.\u201d",
      "Now, as the death toll surges, Sheriff Carrillo finds he is doing some of both.",
      "Most of the migrants come from three Central American countries, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, though the sheriff has also recently found the bodies of Ecuadoreans and Mexicans.",
      "In contrast to those requesting asylum at other locations, those making the furtive journey in this part of West Texas are what law enforcement officials along the border call \u201cTitle 42s,\u201d referring to a Trump-era policy that allows authorities for quick deportations during the coronavirus pandemic. While President Biden promised for months to lift Title 42, he recently announced he was preserving it as the contagious Delta variant sends cases soaring nationwide.",
      "After being sent to Mexico, many of the migrants simply try their luck again, sometimes in exceptionally remote locations in the Chihuahuan Desert. More than 200,000 migrants were detained along the border in July, a 13 percent jump from the previous month and the second-highest number on record, according to Border Patrol figures. Of those taken into custody last month, 27 percent had been previously detained.",
      "Migrant deaths, a grisly reality for decades, are spiking in one stretch of the border after another.",
      "In Arizona, the remains of 127 migrants were found in the first half of this year, up from 96 in the same period of 2020, according to Humane Borders, a human rights group that documents such deaths using data from the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner in Tucson.",
      "In the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas, 69 bodies of migrants were found from October through July, compared with 57 over the same period a year earlier, according to Border Patrol figures. The agency\u2019s Del Rio sector in Texas had an even larger jump, to 71 bodies from 34.",
      "In Sheriff Carrillo\u2019s part of the border, some die from heatstroke or dehydration, left behind by smugglers guiding groups of border-crossers.",
      "But as the sheriff explained, there are many ways to die in the desert.",
      "In one case in late July, he got a call around 3 in the morning. A migrant from Ecuador had been killed by an 18-wheeler when she tried to cross Interstate 10 near the county seat of Van Horn.",
      "Only teeth and a few body parts were recovered, he said, reviewing photos of the gruesome crash. \u201cNo qued\u00f3 mas nada,\u201d he added. Nothing else was left.",
      "In another grim case, Sheriff Carrillo was called to the site of an empty water tank on a cattle ranch, where he found a migrant who had hanged himself on a mesquite tree.",
      "\u201cHe made it all this way only to find the tank empty,\u201d the sheriff said. \u201cWhat would have been going on in his mind at that point?\u201d",
      "Such questions seemed to haunt Sheriff Carrillo as he stared at the pile of manila envelopes on his desk. Each envelope, he said, included details about a migrant who had died in his county this year.",
      "Culberson County, like other hinterland Texas counties, cannot afford its own medical examiner. So the Sheriff\u2019s Department takes the bodies to El Paso, about 160 miles west, where officials charge about $3,500 for each autopsy.",
      "At the same time, Sheriff Carrillo\u2019s jail is so full of smugglers that he has had to start turning away those handed over to him by state troopers or National Guard personnel who are part of Mr. Abbott\u2019s immigration crackdown.",
      "\u201cWhen someone shows up with a criminal, I\u2019m not taking them,\u201d Sheriff Carrillo said. \u201cThere\u2019s no bed space anymore.\u201d",
      "Turning away criminals is not what Sheriff Carrillo had in mind when he got into police work. He projects a law-and-order image, bolstered by photos on his shelf of him with Texas Republicans like Mr. Abbott and Rick Perry, the former energy secretary and former governor.",
      "But Sheriff Carrillo, a Democrat in a predominantly Hispanic county carried by President Biden in the 2020 election, is also known for hewing to positions that can make him something of an outlier.",
      "In 2017, Sheriff Carrillo came under fire from conservatives when President Donald J. Trump jumped to the conclusion that a Border Patrol agent had been murdered after being found with head injuries along a stretch of Interstate 10.",
      "\u201cThey had this narrative that \u2018bad hombres\u2019 came across the border and attacked our law enforcement, and that is not what happened,\u201d the sheriff said, citing evidence that the agent had fallen to the bottom of a culvert.",
      "After F.B.I. agents interviewed more than 650 people and found no evidence of a homicide, pressure on the sheriff eased. He was appointed this year to the board of the Sheriffs\u2019 Association of Texas, a distinction in an organization where Hispanics, on the cusp of emerging as the state\u2019s largest ethnic group, remain severely underrepresented.",
      "Sheriff Carrillo said many of his counterparts, especially those in counties deep in the Texas interior, were curious what it was like on the border these days. He said he tried not to sugarcoat his responses.",
      "\u201cAll these bodies are deserving of an investigation,\u201d the sheriff said, calling the dead migrants \u201cesta pobre gente inocente\u201d \u2014 poor innocent people.",
      "Still, Sheriff Carrillo acknowledged that the climbing death toll was overwhelming small departments like his own, and that dealing with so much death had him contemplating retirement.",
      "His phone keeps ringing with calls about bodies. One week, it is a rancher checking his water lines, the next it is bighorn sheep hunters who spot a corpse.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a young man anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cI had no idea we were going to get bombarded with this crisis.\u201d",
      "The sheriff said he knew his aim of making smugglers accountable remained out of reach. In the meantime, he is hoping to provide the families of dead migrants with some form of closure.",
      "Many of the remains lack identification, so he posts details about some cases on his personal Facebook page. People from across Latin America reach out to him, desperate for information on loved ones.",
      "In one case, a woman in California asked if he had come across the body of her brother, who had an owl tattoo on his leg and often wore a Chicago White Sox cap. Using that information, the sheriff was able to confirm that the remains of a migrant found in June were those of a 28-year-old man from the Mexican state of Veracruz \u2014 the woman\u2019s brother.",
      "\u201cWe were able to get the body back to the familia,\u201d the sheriff said. \u201cAt least we could do that for them.\u201d",
      "On Sheriff Carrillo\u2019s desk, near the manila envelopes that hold information about the bodies he hauls out on the department\u2019s new stretcher, sits another pile of documents: pleas for help from the consulates of Central American countries to find migrants who went missing while crossing the border.",
      "\u201cThese people are out there somewhere,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that someday we\u2019ll find them.\u201d"

    "title": "A Shifting Climate Gave Humans Many Opportunities to Leave Africa",
    "content": [
      "Until recently, scientists believed modern humans left Africa in one enormous exodus around 65,000 years ago. But a new climate model suggests that modern humans had several windows of opportunity to leave the continent far earlier.",
      "The research, published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications, reconstructed the climate of northeastern Africa over the last 300,000 years. The scientists identified when there would have been enough rainfall to allow a group of hunter-gatherers to survive the journey to the Arabian Peninsula.",
      "Archaeological and genetic data still support the idea that all non-African people descended from a single migration that left the continent between 50,000 and 80,000 years ago. But the new paper bolsters the theory that Homo sapiens had multiple migrations out of Africa.",
      "Even if various groups succeeded in leaving the continent, they may not each have played a large role in populating the world. An earlier constellation of fossils, some with contested dating, highlights some of Homo sapiens\u2019s false starts: part of a middle finger from 85,000 years ago, found in Arabia; a human jawbone from at least 177,000 years ago, found in Israel; a skull from possibly 210,000 years ago, found in Greece.",
      "It is inviting to extrapolate the timing and paths of these early journeys from these archaeological records. But the fossils offer \u201climited, rather gappy lines of evidence\u201d of possible migrations, said Andrea Manica, an evolutionary ecologist at the University of Cambridge and an author on the new paper. Dr. Manica believes an ecological model could tackle the question from a new angle: first predict what would have been possible, then see if the fossils line up.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an intriguing question to ask whether there were environmental thresholds for those earlier dispersals, even though those dispersals may have been limited or short-lived,\u201d said Rick Potts, a paleoanthropologist who directs the Human Origins Program at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History.",
      "\u201cThe new paper grasps the important thing,\u201d said Dr. Potts, who was not involved with the research. \u201cThere were multiple instances of our species\u2019 dispersal beyond Africa prior to the main one.\u201d",
      "Jessica Tierney, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Arizona who also was not involved with the research, said she found the approach interesting but inconclusive. \u201cUltimately this is a model, not geology or archaeology,\u201d Dr. Tierney said. \u201cThe mystery remains until you have better and more paleoenvironmental records.\u201d",
      "Dr. Manica and Robert Beyer, a researcher at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, first devised their ecological approach in 2018. Scientists had already modeled the climate as far back as 125,000 years, but Dr. Manica and Dr. Beyer wanted to go back to the date of the earliest anatomically modern human fossils, which were found in Morocco and are estimated to be at least 300,000 years old.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the moment when you see our species actually existed,\u201d Dr. Manica said. Mario Krapp, a research fellow at Antarctica New Zealand and an author on the paper, developed an emulator for the existing climate model to go back deeper into time.",
      "To predict when Homo sapiens feasibly could have moved through northeastern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, the researchers needed to find out the absolute minimal conditions in which humans could survive. \u201cWe wanted to build up this catalog of the good times and bad times,\u201d Dr. Manica said.",
      "They looked at distribution maps of present-day hunter-gatherers and found that human populations are generally not recorded in areas where precipitation falls below 3.5 inches of rain per year. Rainfall this trifling is not enough to sustain green patches of reeds, grasses and shrubs that feed the grazing animals that early humans may have depended on.",
      "Once the researchers set the threshold of survivability at 3.5 inches, they overlaid their climate reconstructions to see when conditions might have been sweet enough to travel through two possible routes into Eurasia: the Sinai Peninsula up north and, further south, the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb , which separates the Horn of Africa from contemporary Yemen.",
      "Their model revealed a handful of historical windows during which there was enough rainfall and relatively low sea levels to sustain a human migration out of Africa. The Sinai land bridge was crossable several times, as early as 246,000 years ago, and the southern strait had even more favorable windows, including the period 65,000 years ago.",
      "The sheer number of crossing opportunities surprised Dr. Manica, given the robust evidence suggesting that only the recent mass exodus had peopled the world with Homo sapiens. \u201cI was hoping, maybe na\u00efvely, that period would just be perfect, where everything was right,\u201d Dr. Manica said. \u201cBut everything was right before as well. Several times, for a matter of fact.\u201d",
      "So the question still stands: If some Homo sapiens were able to colonize Eurasia far earlier, why were they not successful?",
      "The researchers have some theories. If early humans could have moved out of Africa much earlier, they would have faced stiff competition from other early human species; the north was a Neanderthal stronghold, and much of East Asia was likely populated by another extinct human lineage, the Denisovans. The models also suggest that dry periods often followed the favorable windows, which could have isolated any populations undertaking an exodus. But the authors also note that even if times were good and wet, humans may not have taken advantage of these periods to migrate out.",
      "The model had to make several assumptions, including that the southern strait would always have been crossable by humans and that those people might have had the boat technology to make the crossing. The model breaks down the geography of the region to a grid with a resolution with half a degree latitude and longitude, or around 30 miles. This approach inevitably ignores the mosaic of vegetation and topography that exists on the ground.",
      "Dr. Tierney, the paleoclimatologist, said the new paper\u2019s climate models were too simple to predict what climate change was like hundreds of thousands of years ago. She also questioned some of the rules of the model, such as humans only being able to migrate alongside a minimum level of rainfall. \u201cI guess it makes sense to make that assumption,\u201d Dr. Tierney said. \u201cOn the other hand, the Nile River is always there. They could move out that way almost any time.\u201d",
      "Similarly, Emily Beverly, an earth scientist at the University of Houston who was not involved with the research, said the authors did not consider the existence of freshwater springs that could have served as a source of potable water for migrating humans during dry periods.",
      "On the other hand, Dr. Potts, the paleoanthropologist, noted that the minimum level of rainfall in the model would have been \u201cfar too low\u201d to allow hunter-gatherers to successfully disperse out of Africa. Dr. Potts pointed to previous research suggesting that early humans could only have dispersed in the continent when the mean average rainfall was more than 3.9 inches per year, and typically dispersed when there was at least 10 inches of rain. The more interesting research question, in Dr. Potts\u2019 eyes, is what dispersal paths would have been available in these windows of more abundant rainfall.",
      "Perhaps the largest question still remains unanswered. \u201cMore and more evidence suggests we did this multiple times,\u201d Dr. Beverly said. \u201cThe question I\u2019m always left with is, Why?\u201d",
      "Abdullah Alsharekh, an archaeologist at King Saud University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, who was not involved with the research, said he appreciated the paper\u2019s examination of the prehistoric Arabian climate. \u201cThe last couple of decades have shown that many of our questions about out-of-Africa models can be greatly enhanced by more on-the-ground research in Arabia,\u201d Dr. Alsharekh wrote in an email. \u201cWhat lies beneath those sandy deserts?\u201d",
      "Dr. Manica has a similar hope, that future archaeological excavations and genetic investigations will shed more light on Homo sapiens\u2019s staggered foray out of Africa: both the earlier, seemingly unsuccessful waves and the main migration that unleashed Homo sapiens to irrevocably alter the rest of the world."

      "PORTLAND, Ore. \u2014 In the months since the siege at the U.S. Capitol in January, federal investigators have looked closely at the Proud Boys, a far-right nationalist group at the forefront of the riot. Agents have pried into the group\u2019s encrypted messages, pored over video footage of their exploits and built criminal cases against at least two dozen members.",
      "The authorities in Canada have joined in the crackdown, designating the group as a terrorist organization, a move that allows the government to seize assets in that country.",
      "The group\u2019s leader, Enrique Tarrio, was sentenced by the local district court in Washington on Monday to five months in jail for possessing high-capacity rifle magazines a few days before the siege and for burning a stolen Black Lives Matter banner after a separate pro-Trump rally descended into violence in December.",
      "But despite the intensifying scrutiny, an organization that built itself as a band of brothers ready for violent confrontation over what its members see as an assault on Western culture shows no sign of going away. Members have begun regrouping online and joining rallies.",
      "On Saturday, several Proud Boys participated in a demonstration against measures to control the coronavirus in South Carolina \u2014 one of many forays the group is making into local politics. Then on Sunday, dozens of activists wearing the group\u2019s yellow-and-black colors rallied in Portland, Ore., where they fought in the streets with antifascist counterprotesters, shooting paintball guns and smashing windows. One arrest was made after gunfire broke out.",
      "The event had been billed as a rally to unite right-wing groups, but it prominently featured the Proud Boys, a group whose members have espoused misogynistic, Islamophobic, antisemitic and anti-immigrant views. The rally on Sunday developed into a protest over the incarceration of the rioters who set siege to the Capitol on Jan. 6.",
      "With supporters coming from California, Washington State and as far away as New York, the event showed that the Proud Boys were prepared to continue engaging in the kind of public violence that first attracted a law enforcement crackdown.",
      "The Proud Boys were established during the 2016 presidential election and gained substantial momentum through the tenure of President Donald J. Trump, who famously called upon them to \u201cstand back and stand by\u201d; their members were afforded a certain degree of leniency by law enforcement agents who at times favored the group in its conflicts with antifa and other leftist protesters.",
      "That changed after Jan. 6, when a mob of about 100 Proud Boys and their supporters pushed past security barriers at the Capitol and, prosecutors say, took a leading role in helping the larger throng of pro-Trump protesters violently breach the building. Members of the group were at \u201cthe tip of the spear,\u201d court papers say, among the first rioters to shatter windows, break down doors and confront the police inside. The F.B.I. has further learned that both before and after the Capitol attack, two Proud Boy leaders spoke of riling up the \u201cnormies\u201d \u2014 the ordinary people in the crowd.",
      "In the wake of the riot, the federal authorities brought the full weight of their powers to bear on investigating the organization. F.B.I. agents have executed search warrants in New York, California, Florida, Missouri and Washington State. Prosecutors culled through hundreds of private messages on apps like Telegram and social media platforms like Parler. Investigators have targeted leaders of the Proud Boys in particular, arresting chapter presidents from Honolulu, Seattle, Philadelphia and the Winston-Salem area in North Carolina.",
      "Among the targets of the federal crackdown have been Proud Boys from the Pacific Northwest, which has a long history as a base for right-wing extremist groups. One of them, Ethan Nordean of Auburn, Wash., has been labeled by federal authorities as one of the leaders of the Capitol attack. Federal agents also arrested two brothers \u2014 Matthew Klein and Jonathanpeter Klein \u2014 for their roles at the Capitol.",
      "Both Mr. Nordean and the Klein brothers were entrenched in the Proud Boys\u2019 world of conflict long before Jan. 6. Mr. Nordean became one of the group\u2019s most prominent figures after he knocked out an antifa activist in Portland during a protest in 2018. The Kleins appeared at other events in Oregon, according to prosecutors, including one last year in which the police stopped a truck because it appeared that the men in the vehicle might have been preparing for violent conflict. Matthew Klein, one of the people in the vehicle, was cited for unlawful possession of firearms.",
      "During an event last summer in Salem, the state capital, a group of right-wing demonstrators \u2014 including several wearing Proud Boys apparel \u2014 chased a smaller group of counterdemonstrators, hitting them and firing paintballs. The Proud Boys later celebrated one of the attacks in video posted online.",
      "Although the Proud Boys have long been among Mr. Trump\u2019s most ardent backers, the events of Jan. 6 caused some in the group to reassess their support for the former president. Mr. Nordean later told his colleagues, in a group chat obtained by the F.B.I., that he felt betrayed by Mr. Trump for having encouraged the Proud Boys to believe that \u201cgreat justice\u201d was on the horizon but never following through on the promise.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve followed this guy for 4 years and given everything and lost it all,\u201d Mr. Nordean wrote in the chat. \u201cTrump, you left us on the battlefield bloody and alone.\u201d",
      "Since the Jan. 6 riot, the Proud Boys Pacific Northwest chapter, which includes groups in Oregon and Washington, elected to break from the national organization and its national chairman, Mr. Tarrio, according to a court declaration filed by Daniel Arellano, the president of the group\u2019s Seattle chapter. That move came even as Mr. Tarrio\u2019s history as a federal informant was suddenly exposed, damaging his standing among many of his peers.",
      "But throughout the turmoil, Mr. Tarrio, who lives in Miami, has managed to maintain his grip on power despite a handful of competitors challenging his authority.",
      "Mr. Tarrio\u2019s personal troubles deepened on Monday with the news that he would be spending a little more than five months in jail.",
      "The sentence was handed down a day after the Proud Boys\u2019 latest violent foray in Portland. They gathered on Sunday in a retail parking lot, raising an American flag and hoisting a banner referring to people arrested because of the Jan. 6 riot as \u201cpolitical prisoners.\u201d",
      "After antifascist demonstrators arrived on scene, the Proud Boys pursued them with batons, Mace, improvised fireworks and paintball guns. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d shouted one of the Proud Boys leaders as the group went off in pursuit of the antifascist activists, who also used violent tactics during the confrontation and at one point attacked a journalist documenting the scene.",
      "At a nearby middle school, several Proud Boys surrounded a counterdemonstrator seated in a truck. One of them entered the truck and began beating the man.",
      "Later, about 10 miles away in the city\u2019s downtown, a man was arrested after he exchanged gunfire with antifascist demonstrators, according to a police report and a review of video footage from the scene. No one appears to have been struck.",
      "The man who was arrested, Dennis G. Anderson, a 65-year-old Gresham resident, was charged with unlawful use of a weapon and unlawful possession of a firearm, and the Portland Police Bureau said it was looking for one or more additional people who may have fired a weapon.",
      "Mr. Tarrio has claimed that support for the group has only grown since Jan. 6 and said he expects the Proud Boys will probably focus less on large public events for the foreseeable future. Instead, he said, along with supporting those being charged with crimes in the Capitol siege, he is exploring a run for office and wants to help Proud Boys get elected around the country.",
      "\u201cPeople think we are just going to go away,\u201d Mr. Tarrio said in an interview on Monday. \u201cWe are not. Like it or not, we are here to stay.\u201d",
      "Stephen Piggott, a researcher who monitors right-wing extremism for the left-leaning nonprofit Western States Center, fears that to be true. \u201cThey haven\u2019t waned in their commitment to commit acts of violence,\u201d he said."

      "The Food and Drug Administration granted full approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine on Monday, paving the way for more employers, schools and other organizations to mandate the shots.",
      "\u201cIf you are not vaccinated, let this be the milestone that gets you there,\u201d California\u2019s public health officer, Dr. Tom\u00e1s Arag\u00f3n, said after the announcement.",
      "Experts say that the highly contagious Delta variant not only presents an unprecedented threat to those who are not vaccinated, but has also provided ample evidence of the effectiveness of the vaccines.",
      "In California, unvaccinated people are more than six times as likely to contract the coronavirus than those who have their shots, according to state data released on Monday.",
      "And in Los Angeles County, the state\u2019s most populous, an unvaccinated person is as much as 25 times more likely to be hospitalized with the disease.",
      "\u201cThat, in a sense, is our proof that vaccines work,\u201d said Dr. Robert Kim-Farley, an infectious-disease expert at the University of California, Los Angeles\u2019s Fielding School of Public Health.",
      "Similar to how states with low vaccination rates have been hard hit by the latest surge of the coronavirus, so have California counties where large swaths of the population remain unvaccinated.",
      "Of the 20 California counties with the highest proportion of residents currently hospitalized with the coronavirus, 19 have a vaccination rate below the statewide average of 55 percent, according to The New York Times\u2019s coronavirus tracker. (The percentages include children under 12 who are not yet eligible for the vaccines.)",
      "Some of the most heavily affected counties in California are Yuba (36 percent vaccinated), San Bernardino and Butte (both 42 percent).",
      "By contrast, the counties with some of the lowest hospitalization rates include Marin (75 percent vaccinated), Santa Clara (71 percent) and Santa Cruz (64 percent).",
      "The proliferation of the Delta variant has revealed a pattern that was less clear when the virus wasn\u2019t circulating as widely, Kim-Farley told me.",
      "\u201cIn a situation like this where we\u2019re seeing basically Covid everywhere,\u201d he said, it is easier to see the strong correlation between higher vaccination rates and lower rates of disease.",
      "Still, additional factors may be at play, experts say.",
      "A recent survey by the University of Southern California found that people who were unvaccinated were more likely than the vaccinated to go to a bar or a friend\u2019s house and less likely to wear a mask or avoid large gatherings.",
      "In other words, people who choose not to get vaccinated are also probably less worried about Covid-19 and take fewer safety precautions, contributing to their risk of falling ill, said Kevin Malotte, a professor emeritus of epidemiology at Cal State Long Beach.",
      "\u201cLack of mask measures, lack of worry about it, lack of vaccination are all kind of the syndrome, and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing correlate with the high rates,\u201d Malotte told me.",

    "title": "",
    "content": [
      "North Carolina must immediately allow felons who are on parole, probation or supervised release to register to vote, a three-judge panel in a state court said Monday.",
      "The 2-1 ruling, in a state Superior Court in Raleigh, restores voting rights to a disproportionately Black group of roughly 56,000 people who are out of prison but are under some sort of supervision. Black North Carolinians make up 21 percent of the state\u2019s population, but 42 percent of those on parole or supervised release.",
      "The judges said they would issue a formal ruling explaining their decision later. Both the Republican-controlled State General Assembly and the State Board of Elections, which had defended the law in court, said they would await the court\u2019s written opinion before deciding whether to appeal the decision.",
      "The North Carolina State Conference of the N.A.A.C.P., the Protect Democracy Project and Forward Justice, a group pressing for equal treatment of minorities in Southern justice systems, had sued to overturn the law with three local groups that work with former felons.",
      "The ruling \u201cdelivers on a promise of justice by the North Carolina N.A.A.C.P. a half century ago, that all people living in communities across the state deserve to have their voices heard in elections,\u201d said Stanton Jones of the law firm Arnold & Porter, the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs. \u201cAnd now, 50 years later, the voices of those 56,000 people will finally be heard.\u201d",
      "But State Senator Warren Daniel, the Republican chairman of the Senate\u2019s elections committee, said the judges were ignoring a clause in the State Constitution that bars convicted felons from voting unless their rights are restored according to state law. \u201cThese judges may think they\u2019re doing the right thing by rewriting laws as they see fit (without bothering to even explain their ruling),\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cBut each one of these power grabs chips away at the notion that the people, through their legislature, make laws.\u201d",
      "The decision followed a trial that bared the history of the state\u2019s disenfranchisement of Black people in sometimes shocking detail.",
      "The law struck down on Monday, which was enacted in 1877, extended disenfranchisement to people convicted of felonies in response to the 15th Amendment, which enshrined Black voting rights in the Constitution. But in the decade before that, local judges had reacted to the Civil War\u2019s freeing of Black people by convicting them en masse and delivering public whippings, bringing them under a law denying the vote to anyone convicted of a crime for which whipping was a penalty.",
      "A handful of Black legislators in the General Assembly tried to rescind the 1877 law in the early 1970s, but secured only procedural changes, such as a limit on the discretion of judges to prolong probation or court supervision.",
      "In court arguments, neither side disputed the racist origins of the law. But lawyers for the General Assembly and the elections board argued that changes in the early 1970s removed that racist taint, even if the consequences \u2014 depriving former felons of voting rights \u2014 had not changed.",
      "Mr. Daniel also argued on Monday that the procedural changes approved in the 1970s laid down the legal route for former felons \u2014 who had completed their prison sentence and were no longer under any form of supervision \u2014 to regain voting rights, and that the court had no power to change it.",
      "The plaintiffs said the law violated parts of the State Constitution guaranteeing the state\u2019s citizens substantially equal voting power and declaring that \u201call elections shall be free.\u201d Both clauses should apply to all felons who had completed their sentences regardless of their race, they argued. But the law\u2019s obvious discriminatory impact on Black people, they said, was reason enough for it to be struck down.",
      "The ruling on Monday was not entirely unexpected. The same three-judge panel had temporarily blocked enforcement of part of the law before the November general election, stating that most people who had completed their prison sentences could not be barred from voting if their only reason for their continued supervision was that they owed fines or court fees. The judges said that was an unconstitutional poll tax."

      "\u201cWe are, of course, hopeful,\u201d Grant Gillespie, the police chief in Waverly, Tenn., the center of the destruction, told reporters during a briefing on Tuesday. \u201cBut we are still looking.\u201d",
      "Nineteen people were confirmed dead and one remained missing on Wednesday after the catastrophic flash floods triggered by heavy rainfall, which caught many by surprise on Saturday, hitting a stretch of rural communities west of Nashville like a tidal wave.",
      "The number of fatalities and missing people has fluctuated since Saturday. The authorities had previously reported a higher death toll, but officials explained that some of those people had died of causes unconnected to the flooding.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t realize they were not flood victims,\u201d Chief Gillespie said of the individuals removed from the death toll. \u201cThey came through the emergency room or were already in the emergency room and their name got put on the list.\u201d",
      "The updated figures came as officials and residents were emerging from a cloud of shock and confusion. Many were beginning to take stock of the devastation and the daunting recovery ahead of them.",
      "\u201cWe have an extremely long road to go,\u201d said Sheriff Chris Davis of Humphreys County, which includes Waverly and the other hardest-hit communities. He estimated that 125 homes were completely destroyed and hundreds more damaged.",
      "He ticked off a swirl of ingredients that contributed to the catastrophe: the amount of rainfall, which forecasters said would set a statewide record for the most in a 24-hour span; the speed of the downpour; and the loss of the region\u2019s phone and 911 systems. The town of McEwen recorded 17 inches of rainfall on Saturday, breaking the record of 13.6 inches that was set in 1982.",
      "\u201cThe perfect storm happened here,\u201d Sheriff Davis said. \u201cAre we going to definitely look at it and learn from it? Absolutely. We\u2019d be crazy not to.\u201d But, he added, \u201cwe made the best decisions we could when we had to make them.\u201d",
      "President Biden on Tuesday approved a major disaster declaration for Tennessee, making federal assistance available to supplement recovery efforts.",
      "In Waverly, a city of roughly 4,100 people, residents and crews of volunteers worked in blistering heat, gutting flooded homes and businesses and piling the contents outside.",
      "But some also conveyed a sense of not knowing where to begin, with so much work to be done. Some homes had been tossed far from their foundations, and streets were littered with mangled cars and debris.",
      "The National Guard closed a main thoroughfare to all traffic except for residents and those providing assistance. Officials have pleaded with sightseers to stop passing through just to gawk at the devastation.",
      "Many residents were still living in church halls that had been converted into shelters or with relatives whose homes had been spared. The process of rebuilding their lives was starting with baby steps: replacing the clothing, medication and paperwork that had been lost.",
      "Carlos and Brittany McDaniels, along with their two children, have been staying on air mattresses and cots at Waverly First Baptist Church since Saturday, along with dozens of others who were displaced by the floods. Mr. McDaniels said that he and his son received disability checks, but that this month, he did not know where they would be mailed.",
      "Mr. and Ms. McDaniels woke up to a phone call from a friend on Saturday morning warning them about the flooding. They looked out the window and could already see rising water.",
      "Ms. McDaniels woke their two children, and they all raced into the car. As they drove away, they had no destination in mind. They just wanted to get away from the water. \u201cThat phone call saved us by minutes or even seconds,\u201d Mr. McDaniels said.",
      "The family returned home to find a brownish-yellow stain line about five feet off the floor, marking how high the water had climbed. Everything was filthy. \u201cLike someone threw a mud party,\u201d Ms. McDaniels said. The house would almost certainly have to be torn down.",
      "In the nearby city of McEwen, the high school gymnasium had become a relief center. Inside, tables were piled with cleaning supplies, blankets and stacks of clothes. The bleachers were lined with pairs of donated shoes, ranging from slippers for infants to flip-flops in a men\u2019s size 14. Outside, state officials had parked a trailer to print new driver\u2019s licenses for flood victims who had lost their identification.",
      "Officials on Tuesday urged county residents to consider getting vaccines: tetanus if they had been in floodwater, and hepatitis A if they were feeling gastrointestinal symptoms. Both were available at local churches.",
      "But the practical work of recovery was overshadowed by the anguish and horror unleashed by the floods. Even those who did not lose relatives were within a few degrees of separation of someone who died: friends, neighbors, high school classmates, fellow worshipers at their church.",
      "\u201cThese are people we know,\u201d Sheriff Davis said. \u201cThese are people we grew up with.\u201d",

    "content": [
      "A group of the most influential American business groups is urging the Biden administration to restart trade talks with China and cut tariffs on Chinese-made goods that had remained in place after the start of the bruising trade war between the two countries.",
      "The groups, which represented interests as diverse as potato farmers, microchip companies and the pharmaceutical industry, said in a letter dated Thursday that the Biden administration should take \u201cswift action\u201d to address \u201cburdensome\u201d tariffs. They also called on the White House to work with the Chinese government to ensure that it carries out commitments made in its trade truce with the Trump administration, sealed in early 2020.",
      "The letter, addressed to the Treasury Department and the United States trade representative, comes as the relationship between the world\u2019s two largest economies remains fractious. A high-profile visit to China last month by Wendy R. Sherman, the deputy secretary of state, began with acerbic opening remarks from the Chinese side and ended with little sign of progress. The two have squabbled over human rights, cyberattacks and China\u2019s military operations in the South China Sea.",
      "While the Biden administration has mapped out a strategy of confrontation with China on a range of issues, it has said less about the countries\u2019 economic relationship.",
      "It is more than seven months into a review of the trade deal that former President Donald J. Trump signed with China in January 2020, along with other national security measures from the previous administration. Officials have not yet announced the results of that review.",
      "The January 2020 trade truce essentially froze into place U.S. tariffs on $360 billion in Chinese imports. That deal also did nothing to stop the Chinese government\u2019s subsidies of strategic industries like computer chips and electric cars, which have worried American competitors. While some of the provisions of the trade deal are set to expire at the end of the year, much of the agreement will remain in place.",
      "The industry group letter appeared to be an attempt to prod the Biden administration into action.",
      "\u201cDue to the tariffs, U.S. industries face increased costs to manufacture products and provide services domestically, making their exports of these products and services less competitive abroad,\u201d read the letter, which was reviewed by The New York Times.",
      "Adam Hodge, a spokesman for the Office of the United States Trade Representative, said, \u201cIn the first half of this year, the U.S. economy grew at the fastest rate in nearly 40 years, and more jobs have been created in our first six months than under any other administration in history.\u201d He added that the administration was \u201cconducting a robust, strategic review of our economic relationship with China to create effective policy.\u201d",
      "The existence of the letter was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.",
      "The letter said that China had met some of its commitments as part of the trade deal, including new measures to open up its market to U.S. financial institutions. It added that further talks would be the only way to ensure that China would carry out remaining commitments in other sectors, like intellectual property protection.",
      "Though China has made large-scale purchases of U.S. goods since the trade war, the amount and composition have fallen short of its commitments to buy $200 billion worth of American goods and services in 2020 and 2021. According to analysis by the Peterson Institute for International Economics, China fell short of those purchases by 40 percent last year and is off by 30 percent this year.",
      "\u201cWe strongly urge the administration to work with the Chinese government to increase purchases of U.S. goods through the remainder of 2021 and implement all structural commitments of the agreement before its two-year anniversary on Feb. 15, 2022,\u201d the letter added.",
      "While the Biden administration has questioned whether the trade deal with China was well designed, it has also signaled that it will continue to push China on what it perceives as unfair trade practices.",
      "In June, President Biden expanded a Trump administration blacklist that blocked Americans from investing in Chinese companies that aid the country\u2019s military or repression of religious minorities. Mr. Biden included Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications giant, on the list of banned firms. The White House also announced the formation of a trade and technology council with American and European officials, an effort to counter China\u2019s influence by coordinating digital policies between Brussels and Washington.",
      "\u201cWe will not hesitate to call out China\u2019s coercive and unfair trade practices that harm American workers, undermine the multilateral system or violate basic human rights,\u201d Katherine Tai, the United States trade representative, said in prepared testimony for a Senate hearing in May. \u201cWe are working toward a strong, strategic approach to our trade and economic relationship with China.\u201d"

      "Officials initially said the shots could be required by the end of August to help stop the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant. But they decided to wait, bowing to concerns expressed by White House officials about putting a mandate in place for troops before the Food and Drug Administration granted full approval for the vaccine.",
      "The secretary of defense, Lloyd J. Austin III, said in a memo to the staff on Monday that he would seek to speed up a mandate if the F.D.A. approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine before the middle of September, which the agency aims to do. In the meantime, he told the services to begin preparing the force for mandatory vaccinations.",
      "But the middle of September is more than five weeks away, and even then, the administration has not put a deadline in place for when troops must be fully vaccinated.",
      "The decision to delay is the latest shift in the Biden administration\u2019s response to the surging Delta variant. President Biden has expressed frustration with the vaccination rate around the nation and urged the private sector and state and local governments to step up pressure on the unvaccinated. But he has repeatedly passed on ordering troops as their commander in chief to be injected with vaccines that have not been fully approved by the F.D.A.",
      "About 64 percent of the 1.3 million active-duty service members are fully vaccinated. That rate is unacceptably low to the military because it is difficult to deploy troops who have not been inoculated to countries with stringent local restrictions and because a surge of the virus among troops can cripple readiness.",
      "\u201cI want you to know that I will seek the president\u2019s approval to make the vaccines mandatory no later than mid-September, or immediately upon\u201d F.D.A. approval, Mr. Austin said in his memo, adding \u201cwhichever comes first.\u201d He said that the department would keep a close eye on the rate of new virus cases and added that \u201cI will not hesitate to act sooner or recommend a different course to the president if I feel the need to do so.\u201d",
      "But Mr. Austin already recommended a different course to his boss, and the president balked. Last week, the defense secretary advised Mr. Biden that a vaccine mandate was one of the few measures available to protect troops from the virus.",
      "The Pentagon recommended going ahead with the mandate and not waiting for F.D.A. approval, according to three administration officials with knowledge of the internal deliberations. White House and Defense Department legal staff members said the president also had the authority to mandate vaccines for members of the National Guard and the Reserves.",
      "During a meeting at the White House on Friday, defense officials presented a plan to immediately mandate vaccinations for all active-duty service members, the officials said. But White House officials urged caution, the officials said.",
      "In a statement on Monday, Mr. Biden said his administration was \u201con a wartime footing, and every American who is eligible should take immediate steps to get vaccinated right away.\u201d",
      "The president said that \u201cwe cannot let up in the fight against Covid-19, especially with the Delta variant spreading rapidly through unvaccinated populations.\u201d",
      "Health and other officials have said that vaccinating troops could help slow the spread of the virus in communities near military bases and in areas where hesitancy has been strong.",
      "\u201cMilitary settings, including bases with many civilian employees, can be very vulnerable from an infectious disease perspective,\u201d said Lindsey Leininger, a health policy researcher and a clinical professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth. \u201cBetter late than never for the mandate.\u201d",
      "Mr. Biden\u2019s caution came as a surprise to some administration officials because the president announced last month that all federal employees and on-site contractors must be vaccinated against the coronavirus or submit to regular testing and other measures. That requirement affected the 766,372 civilians working for the Defense Department, not active-duty service members.",
      "The Department of Veterans Affairs recently required 115,000 of its frontline health care workers to be vaccinated against the coronavirus in the next two months. The department is looking at ways to expand that mandate to other workers in the system and possibly those who visit department facilities.",
      "Because American military members are governed by different health and justice authorities than other federal workers, the decision is ultimately made by the president, who must grant a waiver to the Defense Department to make vaccinations mandatory for a vaccine not yet approved by the F.D.A. and authorized only on an emergency basis.",
      "The F.D.A. plans to fully approve Pfizer\u2019s coronavirus vaccine, one of the most widely used vaccinations, by early next month, people familiar with the effort have said. But as the Delta variant spreads, some officials and businesses have decided to move more quickly.",
      "Though coronavirus vaccines have become a political flash point in the civilian population, several military leaders said they did not expect much resistance from troops, who are accustomed to getting mandatory shots.",
      "Within minutes of Mr. Austin\u2019s memo, national figures from both parties voiced their support for a vaccine mandate for troops.",
      "\u201cSecretary Austin is protecting our troops with his announcement today that all service members must be vaccinated against Covid,\u201d Leon E. Panetta, who was defense secretary during the Obama administration, said in a statement.",
      "Representative Mike D. Rogers of Alabama, the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, said in a statement that \u201cvaccines protect our men and women, many of whom live in cramped and crowded conditions, from the spread of disease.\u201d",
      "But some Republicans have signaled opposition to the move, especially without F.D.A. approval. Representative Mark E. Green, Republican of Tennessee, warned in a letter to Mr. Austin last week that \u201cmandatory vaccination is illegal for military personnel prior to complete approval.\u201d"

      "The wildfires in the American West are burning vast expanses of specially protected forests \u2014 those that are part of carbon-offset projects meant to counterbalance the carbon dioxide pollution being pumped into the atmosphere by human activity.",
      "Carbon-offset programs, which are designed to fight climate change, typically pay landowners to manage their land in ways that store carbon. Usually, that means paying landowners to not chop down trees.",
      "Wildfires, however, don\u2019t respect those agreements.",
      "An estimated 153,000 acres of forests that are part of California\u2019s carbon-offset project have burned so far this summer, according to CarbonPlan, a nonprofit climate-research organization. Three projects have been affected. In Oregon, a quarter of the Klamath East project, or close to 100,000 acres, has burned in the Bootleg Fire since early July.",
      "\u201cThe worst fire season in Western U.S. history is going on,\u201d said Danny Cullenward, the policy director of CarbonPlan. \u201cThat story is just crashing headfirst into some of the big bets that policymakers and private companies have made about the role of forest carbon as a climate solution. What we are seeing is, a bunch of projects are on fire.\u201d",
      "Forests store carbon by pulling carbon dioxide out of the air and locking it away in tree trunks and other growth. When a tree burns, though, that carbon is released back into the atmosphere.",
      "California\u2019s carbon offset program works by paying landowners if they commit to managing their land for 100 years in ways that will store more carbon than they would have otherwise.",
      "Companies that want to offset their own emissions of greenhouse gases can then buy credits that represent the additional carbon being stored in forests like these.",
      "An official with the California Air Resources Board, which oversees the state\u2019s carbon-offset program, declined to comment on CarbonPlan\u2019s findings.",
      "The program has stirred up controversy, including criticism that credits have been overvalued and that some landowners have taken advantage of the system by accepting payments in return for protecting forests that wouldn\u2019t have been cut down. But experts say the wildfires have highlighted one of the main weaknesses in the program: the small size of the so-called buffer pool.",
      "Buffer pool is a bureaucratic term for a simple idea: It\u2019s an insurance policy against disasters like fires. In effect, carbon-offset projects also protect a small percentage of extra land so that if disaster strikes one project, that extra pool of land \u2014 with contributions from many different projects \u2014 can make up for losses.",
      "But too many fires mean that the insurance policy might not be enough.",
      "\u201cIf the current rate of fire loss continues, the buffer pool will not be sufficient \u2014 and that loss will get greater with climate change,\u201d said Barbara Haya, director of the Berkeley Carbon Trading Program at the University of California, Berkeley.",
      "This month, Microsoft said offsets that the company had purchased were burning. BP also purchased offsets in a large project that is now burning, according to a report by the Washington Department of Natural Resources. (In an email, a BP official said the company doesn\u2019t rely on carbon offsets to meet its emissions reduction targets.)",
      "CarbonPlan\u2019s estimates are based on maps of the projects enrolled in California\u2019s cap-and-trade program overlaid with the active fire perimeters tracked by the federal government. Three additional carbon-offset projects are near large wildfires, according to CarbonPlan."

      "Within hours of the announcement, the Pentagon, CVS, the State University of New York system and the New York City school system, among others, announced that they would enforce mandates they had prepared to carry out but had made contingent on the F.D.A.\u2019s action.",
      "One of the first and largest to move ahead was the Pentagon. Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III had already received authorization from President Biden to mandate vaccines for all active-duty troops once the vaccine was fully approved, and he was moving swiftly to put the plans into action, said John F. Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman. The secretary will soon send specific vaccination guidelines to 1.4 million service members.",
      "\u201cThese efforts ensure the safety of our service members,\u201d Mr. Kirby said during a news briefing on Monday. He said the deadline date for getting vaccinated was still being determined.",
      "Last month, Mr. Biden ordered that all federal employees and on-site contractors must be vaccinated against the coronavirus, or else submit to regular testing and other measures. The requirement applied to the 766,372 civilians working for the Defense Department, but not active-duty service members.",
      "The Defense Department\u2019s website said that as of Aug. 18, more than one million service members have been vaccinated, along with more than 300,000 civilian employees.",
      "Vaccine mandates for college students were also gathering pace after the F.D.A.\u2019s decision.",
      "The F.D.A.\u2019s approval brought into force a requirement in New York, announced in May, that all in-person students at State University of New York and City University of New York schools be vaccinated. CUNY\u2019s website said that after federal approval students \u201chave 45 days to get fully vaccinated or will be subject to potential academic withdrawal.\u201d",
      "The University of Minnesota system, with five campuses and 60,000 students, said on Monday that the coronavirus vaccine would be added to the university\u2019s list of mandatory immunizations for students. And the president of Louisiana State University told reporters that his school would also require vaccination. Each institution had previously said it would do so once the F.D.A. gave a coronavirus vaccine final approval.",
      "The drugstore chain CVS said on Monday that its pharmacists would have to be fully vaccinated by Nov. 30 and that all corporate employees and other workers who interact with patients had until Oct. 31 to comply. The requirement affects about 100,000 employees, the company said. Workers may request exemptions for medical or religious reasons.",
      "And Disney World said unions representing more than 30,000 employees had agreed to a mandate, citing the F.D.A.\u2019s full approval, that would require workers to be vaccinated by Oct. 22.",
      "New York City announced on Monday that every employee of the city\u2019s Department of Education, from principals to janitors, would have to receive at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine by Sept. 27.",
      "Hours later, New Jersey\u2019s governor, Philip D. Murphy, said that all state employees and employees of public, private and parochial schools in his state must be fully inoculated by Oct. 18 or be tested once or twice a week for the virus. And Chevron became the first major American oil producer to require its field workers to get vaccinated.",
      "Before the F.D.A.\u2019s announcement, the three coronavirus vaccines available in the United States, made by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson, were all being administered in the United States under an emergency use authorization. (The Pfizer vaccine remains available on that basis for youths 12 to 15 and for extra doses for some immunocompromised people.)",
      "U.S. officials hope that full federal approval will quiet some of the vaccine misinformation online and induce more hesitant people to get vaccinated. A recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that three out of every 10 unvaccinated people said that they would be more likely to get a shot once it was fully approved.",
      "But whether the announcement will help convince the roughly 85 million unvaccinated Americans to get inoculated without the added pressure of new requirements remains to be seen"

      "The governor\u2019s remarks came at a news conference on Monday after the island of Oahu said it was imposing tighter restrictions on gatherings.",
      "Starting Aug. 25, indoor gatherings of more than 10 people and outdoor gatherings of more than 25 will be prohibited in Oahu, Mayor Rick Blangiardi said.  The new rule will apply for at least 28 days and will affect all events, including those that are professionally organized, a change from previous restrictions.",
      "\u201cWe really thought we saw the light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d Mr. Blangiardi said at a news conference. \u201cBut over the last several weeks, cases have surged and the Delta variant has proved to be more than formidable.\u201d",
      "The governor said he fully supported the actions that Oahu had taken.",
      "Since July 1, Hawaii has experienced a sharp rise in new cases. The state\u2019s seven-day average of new case reports peaked at 729 a day on Aug. 19, more than double the state\u2019s  previous high last fall, according to a New York Times database. In the past two weeks, new cases increased by 37 percent in Honolulu County, and hospitalizations more than doubled.",
      "Mr. Blangiardi said that after extensive conversations with state health officials and health care providers, it was determined that large gatherings were the main cause of the rapid communal spread recently.",
      "The restrictions mean that athletic events at the University of Hawaii will proceed without spectators, and that large concerts at the Waikiki Shell will be canceled. The mayor said that people would still be able to hold weddings, funerals and luaus, as long as they adhered to crowd limits. Restaurants will continue to operate at 50 percent of capacity, and youth sports can finish their seasons as long as parents spread themselves out as spectators.",
      "Hawaii was the last state to expand vaccine eligibility to all adults. About 55 percent of the state population has been fully vaccinated so far.",
      "At the news conference on Monday, officials said they were concerned about low vaccination rates in Oahu and the large number of young men and women with Covid-19 who were being treated in the island\u2019s intensive care units.",
      "Dr. James Ireland, the chief of the Honolulu Emergency Medical Services, said that over the past couple of weeks, island hospitals had seen a net increase of 10 to 14 patients a day. He warned that \u201cvery, very soon,\u201d hospitals would not have the capacity to care for any more patients and that emergency services were close to \u201cmaxed out.\u201d",
      "Although Oahu was acting to curb large gatherings, which appear to be fueling the current spread, officials emphasized that the best way to fight the virus was to get vaccinated. According to the Hawaii Department of Health, the highly contagious Delta variant, which is more dangerous for those who are not vaccinated, now accounts for 93 percent of the state\u2019s Covid-19 infections.",

Known for its award-winning food, Maine\u2019s most populous city expanded its outdoor dining policies during the pandemic, transforming streets, parking lots, sidewalks and squares into culinary hot spots. In the Old Port, brick buildings and stone lanes add a touch of romance to al fresco meals.

    "content": [
      "Follow our live news coverage on the government shutdown and infrastructure bill.",
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Democratic leaders worked feverishly on Monday to cobble together the votes needed to push their $3.5 trillion budget blueprint through the House, facing an internal revolt from moderates who have vowed to block the measure until a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure plan is passed.",
      "But after a day of frenetic negotiations, Democrats ultimately scrapped tentative plans for a vote on Monday. Lawmakers went home shortly after midnight without a clear agreement on how to pave the way for Congress to move quickly to enact an ambitious expansion of the nation\u2019s social safety net over Republican opposition.",
      "While approval of the budget proposal would be a critical step for President Biden\u2019s agenda, its fate was in doubt as divisions in the party flared, pitting a faction of conservative-leaning Democrats against the progressive majority. The House is set to reconvene at noon on Tuesday, and lawmakers are expected to begin debate on the measure.",
      "Several centrist Democrats have refused to move forward with the budget before the infrastructure package \u2014 the product of a bipartisan compromise that passed the Senate this month \u2014 clears Congress and becomes law.",
      "Many progressive Democrats, for their part, have said they will not support the infrastructure measure until the broader budget plan \u2014 expected to include universal preschool, paid family leave, federal support for child care and elder care, expansion of Medicare, a broad effort to tackle climate change, and tax increases for wealthy people and corporations \u2014 is passed.",
      "Speaker Nancy Pelosi was weighing a plan to tie both items together, coupling the budget blueprint with a vote that would allow the House to take up the infrastructure bill in the future, as well as move forward on a voting rights measure that has broad support among Democrats.",
      "\u201cWe must not squander our congressional Democratic majorities and jeopardize the once-in-a-generation opportunity to create historic change to meet the needs of working families,\u201d Ms. Pelosi wrote in a letter to her colleagues on Monday. \u201cThe success of each bill contributes to the success of the other.\u201d",
      "On a day full of closed-door negotiations and frenzied phone calls, it was unclear whether the maneuver would win over the moderate holdouts and allow the budget to advance. In the narrowly divided House with all lawmakers present, Democrats can afford to lose only three votes if Republicans unanimously oppose a bill, as expected.",
      "When asked after midnight whether she would commit to a date to take up the bipartisan infrastructure bill, Ms. Pelosi said, \u201cWe\u2019ll see tomorrow, won\u2019t we now?\u201d",
      "She appealed to Democrats on Monday to back the budget, saying that voters who put Mr. Biden in the White House and their party in control of Congress were watching to see whether they would squander the opportunity to put in place a \u201ctransformative\u201d measure, according to a person familiar with her comments.",
      "Cabinet secretaries and some high-ranking White House officials have called wayward Democrats in recent days, urging them to support the budget and stressing that Mr. Biden backed Ms. Pelosi\u2019s insistence on moving it in tandem with the bipartisan infrastructure bill.",
      "Democratic leaders have repeatedly said that the House would take up the infrastructure bill before Oct. 1, when several of its provisions are set to take effect.",
      "By that time, they hope to have made progress on a huge social policy bill they plan to advance in Congress through the fast-track reconciliation process, in which the details of the budget blueprint are laid out in a package that is shielded from a filibuster, allowing it to pass over the objections of Republicans. That process, too, promises to be plagued by divisions among Democrats who disagree on how expansive their legislation should be and how much it should cost.",
      "Nine moderate or conservative Democrats have said they will not back down from their insistence that the bipartisan infrastructure bill move before the budget plan, even as some of them say they plan to ultimately support the blueprint and the reconciliation bill that springs from it.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t hold up a major priority of the country, and millions of jobs, as some form of leverage,\u201d the Democrats wrote in a Washington Post opinion piece published on Sunday evening. \u201cThe infrastructure bill is not a political football.\u201d",
      "The group includes Representatives Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey; Carolyn Bourdeaux of Georgia; Ed Case of Hawaii; Jared Golden of Maine; Kurt Schrader of Oregon; Jim Costa of California; and Henry Cuellar, Vicente Gonzalez and Filemon Vela of Texas.",
      "Representative Stephanie Murphy, Democrat of Florida, added to the dissent on Monday in an opinion piece in The Orlando Sentinel in which she declared herself as \u201cbewildered by my party\u2019s misguided strategy to make passage of the popular, already written, bipartisan infrastructure bill contingent upon passage of the contentious, yet-to-be-written, partisan reconciliation bill.\u201d",
      "\u201cI cannot in good conscience vote to start the reconciliation process unless we also finish our work on the infrastructure bill,\u201d she wrote.",
      "After tense talks on the House floor, Mr. Gottheimer huddled with Ms. Pelosi and her top deputies as leaders tried to advance the budget blueprint.",
      "The group\u2019s members have said they believe they are doing what Mr. Biden wants, citing comments he made this year calling on Congress to pass the infrastructure bill as quickly as possible. That view has irked many administration officials, who say the president never endorsed moving either the infrastructure deal or the budget blueprint before the other.",
      "Mr. Biden \u201chas been clear that he wants both bills on his desk and that he looks forward to signing each,\u201d Andrew Bates, a White House spokesman, said in an emailed statement. \u201cHe support\u2019s Speaker Pelosi\u2019s approach to the rule because it provides for consideration of the Build Back Better agenda, the historic bipartisan infrastructure bill and critical voting rights legislation.\u201d",
      "Administration officials who have made calls to the nine Democrats in recent days include Martin J. Walsh, the labor secretary; Jennifer M. Granholm, the energy secretary; Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary; Shalanda Young, the acting head of the White House Office of Management and Budget; Louisa Terrell, the director of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs; and Brian Deese, the director of the National Economic Council.",
      "The officials sought to allay the moderates\u2019 fears that Mr. Biden would sign the larger spending bill without the infrastructure bill, according to a person familiar with the calls; they also voiced support for Ms. Pelosi\u2019s push to pass both bills by Oct. 1. Some officials have stressed benefits of the larger bill, including proposals to reduce the cost of prescription drugs.",
      "Ms. Pelosi and her top deputies, backed by dozens of progressive lawmakers, remain equally adamant that the infrastructure vote will happen only after the Senate approves the budget package. In a series of open letters to members over the past week, senior Democrats framed a vote in support of the budget blueprint as a chance to shape key legislation and ensure passage of party priorities.",
      "\u201cEnsuring a bicameral reconciliation process, with true input from the House prior to the passage of the bipartisan infrastructure legislation, is essential to advancing critical Democratic priorities on infrastructure and so much more,\u201d wrote Representative Peter A. DeFazio of Oregon, the chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and a scathing critic of the bipartisan deal.",
      "Progressive groups have also pushed ads targeting the nine Democrats as obstructing the Biden administration\u2019s agenda. No Labels, a centrist political organization, called the group \u201cthe unbreakable nine\u201d in a dramatic montage comparing them to figures like Abraham Lincoln and a fictional senator from the film \u201cBulworth,\u201d in which a suicidal politician decides to tell the truth.",
      "While some Republicans are expected to support the bipartisan infrastructure bill, they are adamantly opposed to the budget blueprint, citing concerns about its size, proposed tax increases and the possibility that increased spending will worsen inflation.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t be surprised, when you write a bill that you know no Republican will vote for it, that none do,\u201d Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, said at a hearing on Monday. \u201cFrankly, that\u2019s why you\u2019ve linked the infrastructure bill and this bill together, because you\u2019re beating your own members into submission.\u201d",
      "Referring to the $1 trillion infrastructure bill, he added: \u201cIf you put it on the floor, it would pass immediately, but you\u2019ve chosen to use it as a weapon against your own members.\u201d",
      "Also on Monday, White House economists sought to push back against Republican warnings about inflation, writing in a blog post that Mr. Biden\u2019s plans to spend trillions on roads, child care, a transition to low-carbon energy and a variety of other economic initiatives would have \u201clittle, if any, effect\u201d on inflation in the months to come."

      "Those results, the university now says, were badly distorted by a testing glitch.",
      "Of 4,500 tests administered on the Rice campus, 81 had returned positive results, mostly in vaccinated members of Rice\u2019s community. Even in Houston, where the Delta variant was surging, the results were a surprise. Rice had taken tough efforts to control coronavirus in its community, practically demanding that students, faculty and staff be vaccinated, even as the state of Texas prohibited vaccination mandates. The university also required masks.",
      "Further examination revealed that most of the people who appeared to have tested positive were actually negative for the virus, the university now says.",
      "When Rice began to examine the cases, it found that the results didn\u2019t make sense, according to a note to the university community on Sunday from Kevin E. Kirby, vice president for administration at Rice. Most of the people who tested positive did not have any symptoms. And the cases were scattered, with no clusters.",
      "Rice discovered that the testing provider that reported so many positive results had just switched to using a new test. When 50 of the people who tested positive were retested using different types of tests, all but one of the results came back negative.",
      "All the same, Rice says that it plans to stick with its decision to move to remote learning until Sept. 3. According to a university Covid dashboard, Rice now considers only 27 of the 4,500 tests administered on campus since Aug. 13 to have yielded true positive results, not 81."

      "Over the weekend, parts of Tennessee were swept by record-breaking rainfall and unexpected flash flooding that killed at least 21 people.",
      "\u201cThis is exactly the type of event we expect to see with increasing frequency in a warming climate,\u201d said Gary Lackmann, a professor of atmospheric science at North Carolina State University.",
      "The Tennessee disaster comes just weeks after extraordinary floods struck Germany, sending water crashing through the streets and causing widespread devastation. In the aftermath, the president of the European Commission called those floods a clear indication of climate change. \u201cIt shows the urgency to act,\u201d she said.",
      "However, flooding is complicated. It can be tricky to determine whether climate change is the driving force behind any individual flood or making it more catastrophic. Here\u2019s why.",
      "A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, which can mean heavier rainfall. Tennessee saw immense amounts of rain over the weekend, including nine inches in three hours.",
      "But flooding is a result both of heavy rainfall and of the way water is managed \u2014 through dams, levees or retention ponds \u2014 as well as a landscape\u2019s hydrology, which refers to the way that water flows, collects and runs off the land. Transforming forests or open land into more impermeable areas, whether parking lots or housing developments, can reduce the amount of land available to absorb runoff.",
      "One reason the Tennessee flood was so deadly is that it was the type of small-scale storm that can challenge forecasting tools.",
      "Smaller-scale storms can be trickier to forecast than large-scale weather systems like hurricanes, which rely in part on radar and satellite data. Any heavy rainfall, which produces heat, can cause the forecasting models to perform poorly.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s sort of a worst-case scenario because it\u2019s a small weather system that happens and develops quickly,\u201d Dr. Lackmann said. \u201cFor these kinds of events, it\u2019s going to be really difficult to get much lead time or forecast warning.\u201d",
      "And attribution studies \u2014 a type of research that aims to establish links between climate change and specific extreme weather events \u2014 can take some time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to attribute a single weather event to climate change,\u201d Dr. Lackmann said. But, he added, \u201cwhen you start seeing these events happening more frequently, it becomes more unambiguous.\u201d"

    "content": [
      "Eighteen midshipmen resigned or were expelled from the United States Naval Academy after an investigation found that students there had cheated on a physics final exam last year, the academy said.",
      "Of the more than 650 midshipmen who took the online exam for a general physics course on Dec. 20, 105 were investigated because they appeared to have used \u201cunauthorized resources,\u201d the Naval Academy said in a statement on Friday.",
      "As of last week, 18 of those midshipmen had either been expelled or resigned, and 82 had been placed in a \u201cfive-month honor remediation program.\u201d Four were found not to have violated the academy\u2019s honor principles, and one was still awaiting adjudication.",
      "\u201cCharacter development is an ongoing process, and midshipmen must make the choice to live honorably each day and earn the trust that comes with a commission in the Navy or Marine Corps,\u201d Vice Adm. Sean Buck, superintendent of the academy, said in the statement. \u201cThis incident demonstrates that we must place an increased focus on character and integrity within the entire brigade.\u201d",
      "Naval Academy students attend the institution, in Annapolis, Md., on full scholarships and are expected to serve five years of active duty after they graduate. The physics test administered in December was taken mostly by sophomores. Those who were found to have cheated were mostly men, and a majority were varsity athletes.",
      "The academy had to be flexible about how the exam was administered because of Covid-19 restrictions, the academy said.",
      "Measures had been in place to prevent cheating on the test: Students were asked to turn in scrap paper showing their work and had been \u201cgiven written and verbal instructions stating they could not use outside sources to complete the exam, including other websites,\u201d according to the statement, which did not name the students who were found to have cheated.",
      "The superintendent called for an investigation after the administration was alerted to possible violations, in part through \u201cpost-exam midshipman discussions on an anonymous chat platform,\u201d the statement said.",
      "\u201cThe investigation team reviewed website browsing history during the exam time frame for all midshipmen who took the exam,\u201d it added. \u201cThe investigative team determined that violation of the exam rules was primarily carried out by individuals visiting websites independently and without any coordinated effort.\u201d",
      "In an email on Monday, Cmdr. Alana Garas, a spokeswoman for the academy, wrote: \u201cPrior to Covid, a majority of the examinations administered were paper, with the professor proctoring the entire section in one room. Social distancing measures during Covid during the 2020-2021 academic year required six-foot distance between students and limited the number of students in one room, so classes were spread out over multiple rooms.\u201d",
      "The academy said in its statement that it \u201cnow strongly advises instructors to use paper-based, in-person exams.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn addition,\u201d the statement continued, \u201cwhen an electronic device is required for an exam, either a browser security program must be activated for all online examinations or a proctor must be able to view each midshipman\u2019s screen throughout the exam.\u201d",
      "The physics test at the Naval Academy was administered around the same time that the United States Military Academy in West Point, N.Y., was confronting its worst academic scandal in decades, after dozens of cadets there admitted to cheating on a May 2020 calculus exam, which they had taken remotely because of the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "In 1994, an investigation at the Naval Academy implicated about 125 midshipmen in a scheme that involved having advance knowledge of answers to an engineering exam. John H. Dalton, who was then the secretary of the Navy, ordered the expulsion of 24 of them.",

    "content": [
      "The violent and deadly flooding in Germany and Belgium last month was an extremely rare event, scientists said Monday, but one that was made more likely by climate change.",
      "The scientists found that the record rainfall that led to the flooding, including a 24-hour total of 3.5 inches in the Ahr and Erft river valleys in western Germany, was a 400-year event, meaning in any given year there was a 1-in-400 chance of such a downpour occurring in the region.",
      "But the analysis showed that while rare, such an event was 1.2 to 9 times more likely now than it would have been more than a century ago, before emissions of heat-trapping gases warmed the world by more than 1 degree Celsius (about 2 degrees Fahrenheit).",
      "And if the world warms to 2 degrees Celsius, as is likely without drastic cuts in emissions, the probability of such an event would increase even more, becoming 1.2 to 1.4 times likely as currently.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still a rare event,\u201d said Maarten van Aalst, director of the International Red Cross/Red Crescent Climate Center, who contributed to the research. \u201cBut it is an event we should be increasingly prepared for.\u201d",
      "The researchers also found that warming had increased the intensity, or amount of precipitation, of such a heavy rainfall by 3 percent to 19 percent. And at 2 degrees Celsius, the intensity would increase another 0.8 percent to 6 percent. Both findings are in keeping with a basic fact of climate change, that warmer air holds more moisture.",
      "The heavy rains in mid-July caused floodwaters to surge through river valleys in north-central Europe, carving up villages and leaving destruction and death behind. More than 220 people were killed, most of them in Germany.",
      "During the flooding, the peak flow of the relatively small Ahr River was closer to that of the Rhine, one of Europe\u2019s largest. \u201cYou had a huge river for a short amount of time rushing through the valley of the Ahr,\u201d said Enno Nilson, of the German Federal Institute of Hydrology, who was also part of the research team.",
      "The study is the latest in the growing field of rapid attribution science, which examines extreme weather events like downpours and heat waves to see whether they were influenced by climate change, and if so, to what extent. It was conducted by World Weather Attribution, a collaboration among climate scientists and others.",
      "The studies are performed quickly, while the event is still in the public\u2019s mind. The speed usually means that the studies are not peer-reviewed until later, but they use peer-reviewed techniques of analysis, incorporating models and observational data.",
      "The flooding study comes with some caveats, the researchers said. By itself, rainfall doesn\u2019t tell the whole story of a flood; river flow rates and water levels are better indicators of a storm\u2019s eventual impact. But the flooding destroyed many instruments that would have provided that data, \u201cso we focused our assessment on heavy rainfall as the main driver,\u201d said Sarah Kew, a climate scientist with the Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute.",
      "The rainstorms occurred over two relatively small areas, too small to be represented in many climate models. So the researchers used a \u201cpooled regions\u201d approach, including other areas from north of the Alps to the Netherlands.",
      "Despite these limitations, \u201cwe still are quite confident that the results we provide are quite useful,\u201d said Frank Kreienkamp, a climate scientist with the German Meteorological Service.",
      "The low end of the range of outcomes \u2014 that warming made such a rain event 1.2 times more likely \u2014 suggests that climate change had less of an influence and that the event was more a result of natural climate variability. But even that figure represents an increase in likelihood of 20 percent attributable to climate change, which is significant, Dr. Kew said.",
      "The research was made public two weeks after the publication of a major United Nations report on climate change, which found, among other things, that extreme weather events will continue to increase in frequency and magnitude as warming continues.",
      "\u201cIf you look at the results we found, they reinforce the conclusions\u201d of the U.N. report, Dr. Kreienkamp said."

      "It was already late on Nov. 9 when Eric Coomer, then the director of product strategy and security for Dominion Voting Systems, left his temporary office on Daley Plaza in Chicago and headed back to the hotel where he\u2019d been staying for the previous few weeks. Both the plaza and the hotel had the eerie post-apocalyptic feel of urban life during the pandemic, compounding the sense of disorientation and apprehension he felt as he made his way up to his room.",
      "Earlier that evening, a colleague sent him a link to a video of Coomer speaking at a conference with a menacing comment below it. \u201cHi Eric! We know what you did,\u201d the commenter wrote. That link eventually led Coomer to a second video, which he watched in his hotel room. What he saw, he quickly realized, was something that was likely to wreck his life, hurt his employer and possibly erode trust in the electoral process.",
      "Over the past decade, Coomer, 51, has helped make Dominion one of the largest providers of voting machines and software in the United States. He was a gifted programmer, known to be serious about his work but informal about almost everything else \u2014 prone to profanities, with a sense of humor that could have blunt force. Coomer, who traveled around the world for competitive endurance bike races, would have blended in on the campus of Google, just one in a crowd of nonconformist tech types. In the more corporate business of elections, he stood out for the full-sleeve tattoos on his arms (one of Francis Bacon\u2019s \u201cScreaming Popes,\u201d some Picasso bulls) and the half-inch holes in his ears where he once wore what are known as plugs.",
      "Coomer was accustomed to working long days during the postelection certification process, but the stress that November was building quickly. Donald Trump was demanding recounts. The president\u2019s allies in the Stop the Steal movement had spent months stoking fears of election fraud. And then on Sunday, Nov. 8, Sidney Powell, a lawyer representing the Trump campaign, appeared on Fox News and claimed, without evidence, that Dominion had an algorithm that switched votes from Trump to Biden.",
      "The video Coomer watched in his hotel room represented a new development in Dominion\u2019s troubles. It was that day\u2019s episode of \u201cThe Conservative Daily Podcast,\u201d a program previously unknown to Coomer, which had been posted to YouTube. \u201cWe\u2019re going to expose someone inside of Dominion Voting Systems, specifically related to antifa, and related to someone that is so far left, and is controlling elections and his fingerprints are in every state,\u201d said the show\u2019s co-host, a man using the pseudonym Joe Otto. Otto \u2014 who would eventually reveal himself to be Joe Oltmann, a Colorado entrepreneur \u2014 claimed that he had found a smoking gun that proved fraud at Dominion: \u201cWe 100 percent know that the election was rigged.\u201d",
      "About 11 minutes in, Coomer heard Oltmann say his name. \u201cThe conversation will be about a man named Eric Coomer,\u201d Oltmann said, spelling it out: \u201cC-O-O-M-E-R.\u201d Next Coomer was staring at a photo of himself up on the screen in what Oltmann called \u201chis little outfit,\u201d a bike uniform Coomer wore in 2016 for a six-day endurance mountain-biking race. Coomer was looking at his own half-smirk, half-smile, the face of a middle-aged man with a sparse goatee, staring into the glare in sunglasses. What other photos did Oltmann have? What other artifacts of his life, of his family \u2014 and how hard was this man looking for all of it?",
      "Oltmann claimed that, earlier that year, he had infiltrated what he said was an antifa phone call and overheard someone \u2014 someone he claimed had been identified as Eric at Dominion \u2014 assure his supposed fellow antifa members that Trump would lose. \u201cHe responds \u2014 and I\u2019m paraphrasing this, right? \u2014 \u2018Don\u2019t worry about the election, Trump is not going to win. I made effing sure of that,\u2019\u201d Oltmann said. He told his listeners that he thought little of who this Eric at Dominion might be until after the election, when a friend sent him a Facebook post about election troubles that mentioned Eric Coomer\u2019s name. Suddenly, Oltmann said, his interest was reawakened. He started looking into Coomer, he said, and \u201cthe more information I got, the scarier it got.\u201d",
      "Oltmann said that in his research he found that Coomer had written \u201cvile\u201d anti-Trump Facebook posts. Oltmann proceeded to read from one of those posts, from July 2016, which characterized Donald Trump as \u201cautocratic,\u201d \u201cnarcissistic\u201d and a \u201cfascist,\u201d among other, more vulgar insults. \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn if you\u2019re friend, family or random acquaintance,\u201d Oltmann read. Anyone who decided to \u201cpull the lever, mark an oval, touch the screen for that carnival barker ... UNFRIEND ME NOW.\u201d Oltmann displayed a screenshot of the post, which said that the author\u2019s opinions \u201care not necessarily the thoughts of my employer, though if not, I should probably find another job. Who wants to work for complete morons?\u201d Oltmann\u2019s co-host, Max McGuire, also read from an anonymous open letter that explained that, while there was no formal organization known as \u201cantifa,\u201d the ideas the public associates with it are worth supporting. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as being antifascist; either you are a decent human being with a conscience, or you are a fascist,\u201d McGuire read. The letter, Oltmann said, had appeared on Coomer\u2019s Facebook.",
      "Coomer watched the video in shock. He is adamant that he never participated in any antifa phone call, and he felt disgusted by the accusation that he had done anything to change the results of the election. The Trump campaign and its allies have introduced more than 60 lawsuits claiming election fraud in this country, but no court has found persuasive evidence to support the idea that Coomer, Dominion or anyone else involved in vote-counting changed the election results. Bipartisan audits of paper ballots in closely contested states such as Georgia and Arizona confirmed Biden\u2019s victory; and prominent Republicans, including Attorney General Bill Barr and Trump\u2019s official in charge of election cybersecurity, have reaffirmed the basic facts of the election: Over all, the results were accurate, the election process was secure and no widespread fraud capable of changing the outcome has been uncovered.",
      "Oltmann is now the subject of a defamation suit brought by Coomer. It currently names, as co-defendants, 14 parties responsible for the dissemination of Oltmann\u2019s claims about that alleged antifa phone call, including Sidney Powell, Rudy Giuliani and the Trump campaign. (Dominion has filed separate defamation suits against Giuliani, Powell, Fox News and others. Lawyers for Giuliani, Powell and for the Trump campaign declined to comment. Fox called the Dominion litigation \u201cbaseless\u201d and defended its right to tell \u201cboth sides\u201d of the story.) Oltmann\u2019s best defense would be to provide corroboration of his claims about that phone call \u2014 he has said there were as many as 19 people on the line \u2014 but he has so far declined to do so.",
      "As Coomer watched the video, though, he felt a second strong emotion: a powerful sense of regret \u2014 because the Facebook posts were, in fact, authentic. Why, he thought, hadn\u2019t he just deleted them? Coomer could imagine how his words would sound to just about any Republican, let alone someone already hearing on Fox News that Dominion was switching votes for Biden. He told me that he believed every word of what he said on Facebook, but when colleagues later asked him what he was thinking, he was frank: He had screwed up. At a time when well-funded efforts to sow mistrust in the election were already underway, Coomer had given conspiracy theorists a valuable resource, a grain of sand they could transform into something that had the feel \u2014 the false promise \u2014 of proof.",
      "Elections in the United States are impossibly convoluted. Every county \u2014 and, in some states, every municipality \u2014 runs its own election, creating a patchwork system in which voters in one place may have a remarkably different voting process from their neighbors just a few miles away. That variation can breed mistrust: If voters in one county believe their election process is being administered correctly, different methods in other counties might strike them as suspect.",
      "Local governments also rely on private companies like Dominion and its competitors ES&S and Hart InterCivic, which together control 90 percent of the voting-machine market, to provide machines, software and technical support. For Americans who are suspicious about an election result \u2014 or are looking to create suspicions \u2014 these relatively obscure, private companies present an obvious target. In 2004, after George W. Bush narrowly won the presidency, Democrats focused on possible irregularities in Ohio, whose 20 electoral votes would have given the presidency to John Kerry. The voting machines used in Ohio that year came from Diebold, whose chief executive, Walden O\u2019Dell, was a longtime Republican donor. A year before the election, O\u2019Dell wrote a letter to about 100 people inviting them to a fund-raiser: \u201cI am committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president next year,\u201d he wrote. The language reinforced mistrust of Diebold machines among some Democrats. O\u2019Dell later said the letter was a \u201chuge mistake,\u201d and Diebold ultimately sold its voting-machine business.",
      "Dominion was founded in the wake of a different controversy: the failure of punch-card voting machines \u2014 and their infamous hanging chads \u2014 in the 2000 election. After Congress funded a bill to replace those machines, many counties purchased direct-recording electronic (D.R.E.) voting machines, which eliminated paper ballots altogether. The limits of that approach became apparent in 2006, when, in Sarasota, Fla., a Congressional race that used D.R.E. machines made by ES&S produced a result that struck partisans and neutral observers as unlikely. ES&S stood by the results, but in the absence of a paper ballot, doubts and uncertainty lingered.",
      "Dominion was well-positioned at that moment. John Poulos, the company\u2019s chief executive and one of its founders, started the business in 2003, serving a small circle of clients who favored a paper ballot. Additionally, Dominion developed a tabulator that kept a digital image of the paper ballots so they could be easily audited. (They also sold machines that met the needs of visually impaired voters, with audio interfaces and headphones that allowed for independence and anonymity.)",
      "Dominion grew fast, acquiring the assets of a competitor, Sequoia Voting Systems, in 2010. Among Sequoia\u2019s staff was Eric Coomer, who became Dominion\u2019s vice president of engineering for the United States. Coomer worked with Poulos for more than a decade at Dominion. (The investment firm Staple Street Capital owns a majority share in the company.) Coomer\u2019s role shifted over time from overseeing the company\u2019s engineers to a more strategic role, working directly with election officials in various states and discussing Dominion\u2019s services on technical panels.",
      "For the 2020 election, activists and experts pushed for paper ballots nationwide, to offer a straightforward, easily audited record. Coomer, expressing a common assurance among election specialists, has pointed out that because every Dominion system \u201ccreates a durable, voter-verifiable, paper record of the cast votes, which is the official record,\u201d voters had concrete evidence of how the vote went in the face of any allegations of electronic vote-switching or other fraud.",
      "At the same time, voting-machine businesses knew that paper ballots can create some confusion among voters \u2014 such as the worry that ink from Sharpies and other markers could bleed through the page and invalidate their vote. In fact, ballot layouts can avoid misreads from bleed-throughs, and Sharpies have the advantage drying quickly, so ink doesn\u2019t smudge on the scanner.",
      "Concerns about Sharpies, however, ending up feeding into coordinated efforts to cast doubt on the 2020 election. In Maricopa County, Ariz., the most populous county in a key swing state, Dominion ballots with a Sharpie-friendly layout were used, and poll workers handed the markers out. Some voters weren\u2019t prepared to use Sharpies after years of being told to avoid them. The confusion reached social media, where, in the hands of partisan messaging networks, the charge quickly became: Republicans were being given Sharpies in Maricopa County in an effort to invalidate their votes.",
      "Dominion was still trying to help election officials address so-called Sharpiegate when Poulos got a call, on Nov. 4, with more bad news: in Antrim County, Michigan, ballots were updated shortly before Election Day but the system used to tabulate them was not. A series of fail-safe procedures meant to address such an error had been overlooked. As a result, preliminary returns showed Joe Biden leading in the heavily Republican county before they were corrected. To the frustration of key players in the election community, neither local officials nor Dominion immediately released a statement explaining what went wrong; the silence created an opportunity for those charging fraud to fill the vacuum with unfounded allegations.",
      "Security experts distinguish between disinformation \u2014 straightforward lies \u2014 and malinformation, information that starts with a detail that is true but is then used or taken out of context to support a false story line. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to fight malinformation, because of the fundamental truth being used to spread the lies,\u201d says Matthew Masterson, who was a senior adviser for election security at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency during the Trump administration. Antrim County, he worried at the time, could be used as a prime source of malinformation.",
      "It was not until Nov. 6 that Michigan election officials began explaining what happened. By then, rumors \u2014 including the false suggestion that Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband owned Dominion \u2014 had spread. Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, held a news conference asserting that \u201cthe fight is not over,\u201d and that Antrim County made her worry that there could be similar irregularities elsewhere. The Michigan State Legislature issued a subpoena to state election officials asking for more information.",
      "That same week, reports emerged of an Election Day glitch in Spalding County, Ga. There, Dominion machines were unable to call up voters\u2019 ballots because of a problem with an outside vendor\u2019s database and because procedures that would have caught the error or provided other ways of calling up the ballots were not followed. The local elections supervisor, however, told Politico that a Dominion representative had explained that the problem was the fault of an update the company made the night before the election.",
      "Poulos was baffled: The technology did not allow for that kind of remote update, as the machines are not connected to the internet. \u201cIt would be like me saying I came into your house and updated your kitchen table without your knowing it,\u201d Poulos said. None of his employees\u2019 phone records reflected any such call, and Georgia election authorities reported that a log file that would have reflected an update the previous day showed none. The Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, eventually called for the ouster of the official. (She is no longer in that position.) But the incident was another story that would stick to Dominion. \u201cGeorgia Counties Using Same Software as Michigan Counties Also Encounter \u2018Glitch,\u2019 \u201d ran the headline on Breitbart News on Nov. 7.",
      "After Sidney Powell\u2019s Nov. 8 appearance on Fox News, Dominion became a fixture in election-conspiracy theories. Originally, right-wing chatter was linking Dominion to election fraud even in cities like Pittsburgh, which the company did not serve. Over time, the focus shifted to three important swing states \u2014 Georgia, Arizona and Michigan \u2014 that used Dominion machines.",
      "Before he left for work on Nov. 10, Coomer checked the settings on his Facebook account. Had he been careless? As he thought, his privacy settings ensured that his posts were only visible to his 300 or so Facebook friends. Coomer started deleting old posts, but he realized how foolishly he had put his faith in a notion of digital privacy. Any one of Coomer\u2019s \u201cfriends\u201d\u2014 and he had several whom he knew to be Trump supporters \u2014 could have taken screenshots of his posts and sent the information along to someone who could use it.",
      "At work, Coomer felt an increasing sense of dread, but Poulos, the chief executive, seemed confident that the Oltmann story would blow over. From Poulos\u2019s perspective, the Conservative Daily Podcast was hardly a top concern when Fox News was allowing Sidney Powell to air claims that Dominion switched votes.",
      "Coomer\u2019s younger brother, who requested that his name not be used out of fear for his safety, set up a dashboard to track online references to Eric Coomer. \u201cI deleted it within two days,\u201d he said \u2014 the material was too disturbing and overwhelming. He recalled some of what he saw: \u201cPeople were essentially taking bets on how my brother\u2019s corpse would be found and which nefarious shadow group would be behind his death. He would be executed by the state or he would be found with a falsified suicide note and two gunshots in the back of his head.\u201d He and Eric\u2019s older brother, Bill, deleted their social media profiles and alerted friends and associates not to answer questions about them; they directed their parents to do the same. The younger brother packed a go bag in case he had to flee his home.",
      "Before long, hundreds of Dominion employees had their private information \u2014 address, phone numbers, names of loved ones \u2014 published on social media, and threats started pouring in to their Dominion email. Angry email messages kept arriving for Coomer as well, and hostile posts continued to appear on social media: \u201cHe\u2019s goin\u2019 to GITMO. No one escapes this. Pain is comin\u2019!\u201d",
      "Over the next few days, as Coomer tried to focus on wrapping up the election certification in Chicago, he thought about his complicated past and wondered what else might surface. He grew up the rebellious child of a high-ranking military officer, a Vietnam veteran who fought during the Tet offensive and was awarded the Silver and Bronze Stars. Coomer, brainy and restless, received an R.O.T.C. scholarship but it was rescinded because of his asthma. As a teenager and into his 20s, he considered himself a skinhead, but he was aligned with a faction who were opposed to racism. \u201cTo me, being skin is being proud that you have a shaved \u2014 at least short \u2014 hair,\u201d he wrote in 1991.",
      "Coomer earned his Ph.D. in nuclear engineering from Berkeley in 1997 but grew disenchanted with academia. He started to fill more of his time with rock climbing and moved to Colorado. He summited Yosemite\u2019s El Capitan several times and became well known enough among elite climbers that he landed a job at Planetoutdoors.com, which employed top athletes to answer customer questions. While he was there, he started writing code for the company. He continued climbing, until problems in his personal life slowed him down.",
      "In 2004, at age 34, he wrote on a climbing message board about his struggles with heroin and cocaine and how much they had damaged his life. By then, he was on the verge of bankruptcy, had lost his marriage and had ended up in prison after being charged with several counts of driving under the influence. \u201cAnother bout of dry heaves racked my body as I lay on the cold cement floor of the jail cell,\u201d he wrote. \u201cJail is no picnic under the best of circumstances \u2014 being in jail while withdrawing from heroin is absolutely the worst I can imagine.\u201d",
      "In 2005 he managed to stop using heroin for good. \u201cI stayed with a friend for a week and told him to take my shoes and my wallet,\u201d Coomer told me. Three months later, while he was still in withdrawal, he received a cold call from someone asking if he would consider doing programming work for Sequoia, the voting-machine company whose assets Dominion purchased five years later.",
      "Soon, he was channeling the same obsessive focus he had for climbing into the voting-machine business, its obscure state laws and county regulations, its competing and complicated demands for privacy, security, access and verifiability. \u201cI fell in love with the election business,\u201d Coomer said. \u201cThere\u2019s no money in it, and you only ever hear from people complaining about what went wrong. But it felt meaningful.\u201d",
      "In 2016, Coomer was on Facebook when he came across a few posts from a relative referring to Barack Obama as a Muslim born in Kenya. Coomer was appalled that one of his own family members was spreading disinformation, but instead of confronting his cousin directly, he poured all his disgust and disappointment into a 200-word anti-Trump screed that he posted on Facebook. \u201cIt was not intended for the general public,\u201d Coomer said. \u201cIt was a lashing out.\u201d Years later, after the death of George Floyd, Coomer posted links to a punk band singing \u201cPigs for Slaughter\u201d and a hip-hop song called \u201cCop Shot.\u201d (On his podcast, Oltmann highlighted Coomer\u2019s linking to both songs.)",
      "About a year before the 2020 election, Coomer was part of several conversations among Dominion employees about how to balance their right to express themselves with the sensitivities specific to their industry. Dominion also searched through its employees\u2019 social media accounts, checking for comments or tweets that might reflect poorly on the company. No one ever raised any concerns with Coomer about his posts, because his posts were available only to his Facebook friends.",
      "On Friday, Nov. 13, the right-wing news outlet the Gateway Pundit, picking up on Oltmann\u2019s podcast, ran a story that mentioned Coomer by name in the headline, included links to videos in which Coomer was talking about election security, and ran a full reprint of the open letter about antifa that he had reposted on Facebook. While most of that letter was uncontroversial \u2014 \u201cAntifa supports and defends the right of all people to live free from oppressive abuse of power\u201d \u2014 one line concluded that while nonviolent protest was preferable, \u201cwe cannot and will not take responsibility for telling people how they are allowed to be righteously outraged.\u201d The letter also called for President Trump and Vice President Pence to resign, although \u201cNancy Pelosi isn\u2019t a great deal of improvement.\u201d (Coomer says he considered the letter satirical.) As soon as the Gateway Pundit article ran, Coomer knew he no longer could hope, realistically, that his name would recede from the news.",
      "Later that evening, Poulos asked Coomer to join a call with Gabriel Sterling, the chief operating officer for the Georgia secretary of state. Sterling met Coomer in 2019, when Dominion won a contract to help Georgia upgrade its voting machines. Someone had forwarded Sterling an article \u2014 possibly the one in the Gateway Pundit, he says \u2014 that featured the Facebook posts as well as Oltmann\u2019s claim about Coomer rigging the election. \u201cMy gut told me it was crap to begin with, but I had to ask the question,\u201d Sterling says.",
      "Yes, Coomer told both men, I did write or repost those things; no, it has never affected my work. No, I never was on an antifa phone call. No, I never said that I would interfere in the election in any way. Sterling \u2014 who considered Coomer \u201cone of the best\u201d in the business \u2014 told Coomer that those postings, especially the one about antifa, were \u201ca dumb-ass thing to do.\u201d Coomer sounded deflated to Sterling. Coomer says it was \u201cexcruciating\u201d to realize that Sterling\u2019s reputation might suffer.",
      "When they hung up the phone, Poulos made it clear that he found the situation deeply problematic. Coomer began to fear he might lose his job but became defiant. \u201cI was like \u2014 \u2018I don\u2019t know, First Amendment?\u2019\u201d Coomer told me. Dominion, he reminded Poulos, had done nothing wrong; he had done nothing wrong. \u201cMy attitude was: This is bullshit. I\u2019ve never done anything but try to make the whole process more transparent and auditable and free and fair.\u201d",
      "Election officials who knew Coomer were surprised that he would express his political views so bluntly. \u201cIt\u2019s not what we do in this industry,\u201d says Masterson, the election-security adviser in the Trump administration. \u201cGenerally, this community is very tough on people who don\u2019t toe that line.\u201d Masterson considered the misstep an anomaly for Coomer, someone he had known for about a decade. \u201cHe was serious about his job,\u201d Masterson said. \u201cI never encountered him as being anything other than professional and making the system as good as he could.\u201d",
      "The posts also pained Jennifer Morrell, a founder of the Elections Group, a company that helps counties and states comply with voting regulations. \u201cIt didn\u2019t look good,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the frustrating part. I know this individual to be a really decent person who cares a lot about democracy and getting things right and transparency \u2014 and you read something like that, and it is a really hard thing to get past, for critics.\u201d Morrell, who came to know Coomer through a Colorado working group intended to improve the state\u2019s audit system, described him as \u201cirreverent\u201d but clearly ethical; the posts, she said, did not reflect the person she knew.",
      "Coomer was hardly the first person to seek the rush of righteous self-expression on social media, only to discover the long-lasting costs later. He spent a lot of time wondering how Oltmann got his hands on those posts. Had a political operative been doing opposition research on various election officials, keeping it at the ready, depending on the election results? Coomer, a self-described motorhead with an interest in vintage cars, started to think the source might have been a Facebook friend he made at Bandimere Speedway, a racetrack he sometimes visited. The racetrack had hosted a meeting organized by a local businessman who was starting to make a name for himself in Colorado politics, Joe Oltmann.",
      "If Eric Coomer\u2019s life changed on Nov. 9, so did Joe Oltmann\u2019s. On his follow-up podcast the next day, Oltmann told his audience that he had good news. \u201cI have been in touch with someone who has put us in touch with the Trump attorneys,\u201d he said.",
      "That week, Oltmann spoke to Jenna Ellis, a Trump campaign lawyer who frequently appeared with Giuliani to promote lawsuits to challenge the election results. She told him that he should prepare a notarized affidavit of his allegations, which he did with help from the lawyer and conservative radio host Randy Corporon. That Saturday, Corporon invited Oltmann on his radio show, and Representative Lauren Boebert, a Republican from Colorado, called in to talk about the election. She thanked Oltmann for his work.",
      "Before the election upended his life, Oltmann was the chief executive of PIN Business Network, a digital-marketing company that he founded, which had about 60 employees. The co-owner of a gun shop, he was politically conservative and community-minded \u2014 a member of the United Way Tocqueville Society and a board member for a nonprofit group that assists refugees. (Oltmann asked that I not name the organization, though it confirmed his association. He also rejects the label \u201cconservative\u201d despite the name of his podcast.) The arrival of the coronavirus pandemic marked his move into a more public role: In the spring of 2020, he helped start the Reopen Colorado movement, which organized anti-lockdown protests. People were struggling as others were \u201cthrowing the Constitution in the trash,\u201d he told me. He began giving impassioned interviews about the public-health measures imposed by the state\u2019s governor, Jared Polis.",
      "By that October, following the 2020 summer of protests, he had founded a nonprofit group, FEC United, intended, its website says, \u201cto defend the foundation of our American Way of Life through the pillars of Faith, Education and Commerce.\u201d FEC formed a partnership with a group known as the United American Defense Force, which, the site explains, offers \u201cprotection and support when first responders are unwilling or unable to fulfill their civic duties.\u201d Oltmann characterizes it as a humanitarian group, though he added in an email, \u201cWe are all armed.\u201d At one early FEC event, a so-called Patriot Muster, a Trump supporter assaulted and pepper-sprayed a security guard, who shot and killed him. (The guard was charged with second-degree murder and has pleaded not guilty.)",
      "The Coomer story took Oltmann from the small world of right-wing politics in Colorado into broader Republican circles. The same week that he spoke to Jenna Ellis, Oltmann gave an interview about Coomer to Michelle Malkin, a former Fox contributor in Colorado who had joined the even-further-right network, Newsmax.",
      "Around this time, Oltmann began developing his theory of how a voting system could allow for fraud, which he later explained at length in a film called \u201cThe Deep Rig\u201d: Someone could manipulate the system in various ways to allow for the possibility of adding fake or phantom ballots, which could be entered into the tabulation system. Real ballots would be replaced with the fake ones without a history of that happening. \u201cIt\u2019s clear from the video that Joe Oltmann does not understand how elections are conducted or how the technology works,\u201d says Morrell, who said some of what Oltmann proposed would require a widespread effort of workers from both parties colluding to bypass some key systems.",
      "Thanks to Oltmann and others, the conviction that Dominion had helped rig the election for Joe Biden seemed to solidify among some of Trump\u2019s most loyal supporters. On Thursday, Nov. 12, One America News Network, also known as OAN, ran a story about Dominion. Shortly after that, Trump retweeted: \u201cREPORT: DOMINION DELETED 2.7 MILLION TRUMP VOTES NATIONWIDE,\u201d the first of many times Trump went to Twitter to attack Dominion. Five days later, an OAN correspondent, Chanel Rion, tweeted out Oltmann\u2019s claims about what Coomer supposedly said on that antifa phone call. Then, just eight days after Oltmann first mentioned Coomer on his podcast, Eric Trump broadcast it to its widest audience yet. \u201cTrump\u2019s not gonna win. I made f**ing sure of that!\u201d Eric Trump tweeted, above a photo of Coomer and a link to another Gateway Pundit article that called Coomer, in its headline, \u201can unhinged sociopath.\u201d (Lawyers for Malkin, Rion, OAN and the Trump campaign, each a defendant in the Coomer lawsuit, did not respond to requests for comment. Lawyers for the Gateway Pundit, another Coomer defendant, declined to comment.)",
      "Rion later invited Oltmann on her show to discuss his claims, and the segment became one of OAN\u2019s highest rated clips, amassing 1.5 million views on YouTube. By then, Eric Coomer\u2019s name started trending on Twitter, along with #ArrestEricCoomer.",
      "On Nov. 19, Poulos, sitting in his office at his home in Toronto, turned on a small television to watch a news conference happening at the Republican National Committee headquarters, which Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell were hosting. He knew that Giuliani and Powell had each separately accused Dominion of wrongdoing on Fox News and on right-wing news sites; but he dreaded hearing his company\u2019s name at an event that seemed to have the full legitimacy of the R.N.C. behind it.",
      "After half an hour of watching the event at the R.N.C., what Poulos had feared came to pass: Giuliani referenced hacking \u201cbeing done by a company that specializes in voter fraud,\u201d then turned the microphone over to Sidney Powell. Powell listed a series of implausible claims about Dominion in deadpan, lawyerly tones, pushing up a sleeve of her leopard-print cardigan as if to show she had real work to do. She spoke of \u201cthe massive influence of communist money through Venezuela, Cuba and likely China\u201d on Dominion\u2019s operations.",
      "Poulos says that while he watched, he was in such a state of disbelief that he had to remind himself that what he was seeing was real and not part of a nightmare. \u201cOh, my God!\u201d he screamed. \u201cI can\u2019t believe what\u2019s going on!\u201d He yelled so loudly that his wife and two teenage children came running into his home office. They found him there, beside himself, crying. His children had never seen him remotely emotional about his work; now they stared, shocked and mute. Poulos felt anger toward Giuliani and Powell for using their power to spread false information. He also felt some sympathy for those voters, disappointed by their candidate\u2019s loss, who would inevitably be eager to believe what they were hearing from people so close to the president. The way many people felt watching the insurrection on Jan. 6, Poulos told me, was how he felt during that news conference. \u201cIt was an assault on democracy,\u201d he says.",
      "Powell mentioned Coomer by name, embellishing Oltmann\u2019s story by claiming that there was an actual recording of Coomer on the antifa call. Giuliani brought Coomer up as well. \u201cBy the way, the Coomer character, who is close to antifa, took off all of his social media. Aha! But we kept it. We\u2019ve got it. The man is a vicious, vicious man,\u201d Giuliani said. The room where he was speaking was, from all reports, hot and airless; Giuliani was sweating. Brown liquid started snaking down both sides of his face. \u201cHe wrote horrible things about the president,\u201d Giuliani continued. \u201cHe is completely warped. And he specifically says that they\u2019re going to fix this election. I don\u2019t know what you need to wake you up to do your job!\u201d",
      "When Coomer watched the news conference, he started sweating and shaking; he thought he might vomit. Already, earlier that week, he had met with security officials that Dominion hired, who told him it was not safe for him to go home. The day before the news conference, he had gone back to Colorado, where he had arranged to stay at a friend\u2019s cabin in the mountains.",
      "His arrival had been fraught. When the plane touched down at the airport, Coomer tried to log into his work email, with no success. He texted Poulos to let him know he was having a problem. Poulos reminded him that he had suggested Coomer take a break, which Coomer interpreted to mean he should try to take it easy for a while. He was still helping clients, he reminded Poulos; his boss told him the company would take care of things without him. Only then did Coomer realize that the walls were already going up around him. He was officially on leave, but he suspected that he would never work in elections again.",
      "After he left the airport, he stopped by his home to feed his cats and pick up a rifle. He then drove out of town to his friend\u2019s cabin. It was equipped with surveillance cameras, an elaborate security system and a gun safe; he placed multiple guns around the property, so they would be easily reachable. Then he tried to calm down. He had a lot to figure out, including what he was going to do with the rest of his life.",
      "For several months, Coomer moved around to relieve his isolation, visiting close friends, declining to tell his parents and siblings where he was staying to eliminate the possibility that anyone would slip up and reveal details of his whereabouts to someone who might make them public. Even though all his friends told him watching Oltmann\u2019s show was a terrible idea, he did it anyway \u2014 it was a way of staying on top of the situation, of confronting his own fears.",
      "He tracked the story on social media as it moved from Oltmann\u2019s assertion that he had rigged the election to an explanation of how he did it. On right-wing Twitter, a particular story line took off, focusing on the Dominion system of adjudication, which had Coomer\u2019s name, among others, on the patent. Like all digital-adjudication systems, Dominion\u2019s allowed election officials to set various parameters to determine at which point a ballot \u2014 if it had additional writing on it or only partially-filled ovals \u2014 would be directed to a bipartisan panel that would then agree, based on state standards, on voter intent. Rather than making a new paper ballot, the system would create a digital record of the new adjudicated result while preserving the original digital record. In one widely circulated video, Coomer was walking election officials through the ways they could use it, using the first person to describe the various steps, which suspicious viewers took literally, as if he were letting the officials know how he, personally, could change the adjudication settings.",
      "In the latter half of November, a letter arrived at his parents\u2019 home with a handwritten profanity scrawled at the bottom, telling them their son would suffer in jail. His father, now 80, began carrying a weapon on his person, even at home. They received two calls in the middle of the night, strangers asking to speak to Eric.",
      "Coomer\u2019s parents had already suffered more grief than most do in a lifetime. Their daughter died in a car accident when she was only 9 and Coomer was 22. Nine years ago, his older sister, who worked as a paralegal and a teacher, also died, at age 47, after a long illness. Coomer felt powerless: He could not protect his family from harassment, could not spare them further worry for the safety of one of their children. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he told them over and over.",
      "Coomer stopped returning friends\u2019 calls, was sleepless at night and suffered from panic attacks during the day. Occasionally, he returned home for a few hours. On one occasion in mid-December, two men pulled up to the house. Did they follow him there or just get lucky? He had no idea, but he grabbed a gun. One of the men walked around the perimeter of his house; the other came right to the door, peering in the large window. One had a video camera. \u201cHas anybody from the D.O.J. tried to contact you?\u201d the man called out, in Coomer\u2019s recollection. \u201cWe just want to know why you threw the election. Do you have a few minutes to talk?\u201d Coomer told them to leave \u2014 they were trespassing. Twenty minutes after they left, he got a voice-mail message: One of the men identified himself as a journalist for a right-wing news site, now calling to follow up.",
      "In December, as Trump\u2019s various lawsuits were starting to be dismissed in court, Oltmann began posting more menacing messages. \u201cEric Coomer, you are a traitor,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are coming for you and your shitbag company.\u201d",
      "On Dec. 8, Coomer responded to some of the attacks. In an op-ed for The Denver Post, he called out the \u201cfringe media personalities\u201d who \u201ccontinue to prey on the fears of a public concerned about the safety and security of our electoral system.\u201d He also claimed that \u201cany posts on social media accounts purporting to be from me have also been fabricated.\u201d And yet, Coomer had written the posts that Oltmann had highlighted. Asked about the misleading language, Coomer concedes that his writing could have been clearer but says he was referring to social media purporting to be his that were posting at the time (his own Facebook account was no longer active). The column did not help Coomer\u2019s credibility among those inclined to mistrust him already.",
      "His name, virtually unknown in most mainstream circles, was now tightly linked with the story of Dominion fraud, especially among QAnon followers: According to the nonpartisan and nonprofit group Advance Democracy Inc., from Nov. 1 to Jan. 7, Coomer\u2019s name appeared in 25 percent of the tweets that mentioned Dominion in its database of QAnon-related accounts.",
      "On Dec. 22, Coomer filed his defamation lawsuit. \u201cTogether, defendants conceived of a story that the results of the election were fraudulent and consciously set out to establish that Dr. Coomer perpetuated this fraud so as to further their own ends,\u201d the amended complaint reads. All the claims they made about Coomer started with Oltmann: It was his story about Coomer being on an antifa call that Eric Trump retweeted, that Giuliani and Powell trumpeted at the Nov. 19 event at the R.N.C. Their defense would rest on the credibility of Oltmann\u2019s claim or at least some proof that it had a basis in reality.  ",
      "The day before the defamation lawsuit was filed, Oltmann reported on his podcast that the F.B.I. had been asking questions about him, although he did not specify why. Dominion, too, sent him a letter demanding that he retract his statements and preserve all records related to his repetition of the \u201coutlandish story that you infiltrate(d) Antifa.\u201d",
      "Early in the new year, Oltmann was gearing up for the rallies planned before the ascertainment of the election on Jan. 6. \u201cDo not tell me you are tired,\u201d he wrote in a post that 1,001 people liked. \u201cI\u2019m here to tell you we are winning this fight against evil. Now stand the hell up, run some dirt in it, and don\u2019t stop till the evil is crushed with the heel of your shoe. ... we are the warriors who MUST stand up to the evil we face.\u201d",
      "On Jan. 5, at a rally on Freedom Plaza in Washington, a series of anti-vaxxers, conspiracy theorists, Soros-haters and Trump supporters addressed a large crowd. \u201cIf they want to fight, they better believe they\u2019ve got one!\u201d the right-wing radio host Alex Jones roared. Peter Navarro, a White House adviser, whipped the crowd into a frenzy about the supposedly false election. And then finally, following Roger Stone, the last speaker of the day stepped up to the lectern: Oltmann. He was introduced as a businessman, a data expert and, \u201cmost importantly, the guy who found and fingered Eric Coomer.\u201d Oltmann tried to talk the crowd through a flowchart presentation involving tabulation systems and fake ballots. But by far the biggest response he got was when he mentioned Coomer. \u201cEric Coomer is suing me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to crush him in discovery.\u201d The crowd roared.",
      "Later, Oltmann described, in various podcast interviews, what happened during his time in Washington. On Jan. 6, he claims that he went to the State Department to talk to a lawyer who worked with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to explain what he\u2019d uncovered. (\u201cThey said, \u2018If this is true ... this is a coup!\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, that\u2019s exactly, that\u2019s what I would call it!\u2019\u201d he recalled.) He also claimed that he met with John Eastman, a lawyer who was arguing to Trump\u2019s team that Pence could legally reject the election. Oltmann claimed that he fed Eastman the theory of election fraud that he presented at the rally on Jan. 6 near the Ellipse, where Trump spoke shortly before a crowd stormed the Capitol.",
      "Oltmann also said he asked Giuliani to arrange a meeting with Trump to walk him through the same theory of election fraud he had been presenting to others. \u201cI was like, \u2018Look, just put me in front of President Trump,\u2019\u201d Oltmann recalled, claiming that Giuliani and others arranged for him to have that meeting on Jan. 7. (In a deposition, Giuliani said he did not believe he had met Oltmann, but he could not be sure.) But the day after the insurrection, doors that had perhaps once been open were now closed. \u201cThere were people who stopped me from having those meetings with President Trump on the 7th,\u201d Oltmann told one podcaster. \u201cWe were dealing with a compromised group of people who don\u2019t understand what courage is.\u201d",
      "Instead of meeting with the president, Oltmann said, he received a call from an executive at PIN, who was calling to tell him that he had lost the confidence of the board. Oltmann stepped down. He called it a \u201csad day and something that is driving my fire to get to the bottom of the truth.\u201d",
      "In those first weeks at his friend\u2019s cabin, Coomer sometimes felt rage at all that had been taken from him. Often he lay awake all night, trying to determine if he heard sounds outside. Following the violent events of Jan. 6, Coomer decided to leave the country ahead of the inauguration. He remained abroad for three weeks, finding respite in a whole world full of people whom he could be fairly sure had never heard of him.",
      "In late April, Coomer decided to take a three-week camping trip with no access to email or text messages. On May 14, when he was again within range of a cellphone tower, his phone started pinging, over and over and over. Congratulations, many of the texts read; but he was also receiving texts and voicemails that reminded him of what he\u2019d left behind \u2014 harassment, comments from hostile strangers that arrived on his phone telling him, one way or another, that he was going to jail.",
      "Coomer was receiving a new onslaught of attention because Newsmax, which had originally been named in his defamation lawsuit, had decided to settle. It also issued an apology, acknowledging that it had found \u201cno evidence\u201d to support the claims the network aired about Coomer\u2019s influencing the election. Coomer felt some relief: It sometimes had seemed that there would never be any accountability, for anyone, ever. But at the same time the number of hostile texts he received reminded him that no settlement was likely to put an end to his ordeal.",
      "In May, Coomer formally left Dominion after negotiating \u201ca mutually agreed-upon separation\u201d with them. It was, he says, a surreal day: One more reminder that his life had changed irrevocably.",
      "By June, a dossier on Coomer that was more than a hundred pages long began making the rounds on Telegram. It included links to writing Coomer posted as a 20-something about the loss of his younger sister; it included photos of his ex-wife and five possible email addresses for her and listed what it claimed were the make and model of his brother\u2019s car; it proposed a far-fetched theory that Coomer\u2019s animus toward Trump was because of political decisions that hurt his brother\u2019s employer. It also included a link to the essay Coomer had posted on a climbing message board in which he spoke frankly of his drug addiction and where he mentioned, in a back and forth with commenters, a mental-health disorder (although Coomer now says he was never clinically diagnosed). Even before he saw the dossier, Coomer knew from his incoming texts and emails, which overflowed with threats, that something new was out there, continuing to stoke people\u2019s anger.",
      "On Aug. 11, Oltmann was scheduled to be deposed by Coomer\u2019s lawyers for the defamation suit. Coomer arrived at the state courthouse in Denver early that morning; it would be the first time he would be in the same room with Oltmann.",
      "Coomer sat with his lawyer, Steve Skarnulis, who had flown in from Austin, and two other lawyers. At 9 a.m., Oltmann\u2019s lawyer told them that Oltmann would not be appearing in court because he didn\u2019t feel safe in the courthouse. (His lawyer, Andrea Hall, had offered to do the deposition via Zoom.) The judge was compelling him to reveal the name of the person who brought him in on the antifa conference call, and even though the court agreed the name would remain sealed, Oltmann had refused \u2014 for that person\u2019s safety and his own, he said. Now he was afraid that if he were put in jail for contempt, he would be \u201cdead within 72 hours,\u201d Hall, told me.",
      "In the previous weeks, the judge assigned to Oltmann\u2019s case made rulings that did not cut in his favor, including allowing Coomer\u2019s legal team to do preliminary discovery with the various defendants. Coomer\u2019s lawyers have also deposed Powell and Giuliani about their roles in spreading their conspiracy theories about Coomer and Dominion.",
      "\u201cThe judge has become an activist judge,\u201d Oltmann said on an episode of \u201cConservative Daily\u201d in July. \u201cShe\u2019s allowing things to go forward that should not have been allowed to come forward.\u201d At times, the weight of the charges seems to weigh heavily on him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get to the place where I feel sorry for myself,\u201d Oltmann said during a special three-part \u201cConservative Daily\u201d podcast on the topic of the Coomer suit. He sounded emotional. \u201cI don\u2019t feel sorry for myself.\u201d",
      "Oltmann says that he, like Coomer, has been the subject of death threats. On his podcast, though, he continues to push an ever-grander theory of election fraud. The more viewers Oltmann attracts, the bigger his audience for a service he promotes on his show, the so-called Fax Blast, in which users can pay to have faxes sent to various legislators on their behalf. This spring, he started attracting advertisers as well, including MyPillow, a business owned by Mike Lindell, who is also being sued by Dominion for his statements accusing the company of rigging the election. (Previously one of the biggest advertisers on Fox News, Lindell has been boycotting the network since they refused to air an advertisement claiming election fraud. He did not respond to a request for comment.)",
      "Instead of showing up in court on that August morning, Oltmann was in South Dakota, at a cybersecurity symposium hosted by Lindell, who at one point rushed offstage when it was announced that his motion to dismiss Dominion\u2019s defamation had been rejected. Steve Bannon, who was also at the event, interviewed Oltmann on his podcast, \u201cBannon\u2019s War Room.\u201d \u201cI think people are asking,\u201d Bannon said to Oltmann, \u201cif it\u2019s a lawsuit and you think you\u2019ve got the truth and law on your side, why would you not show up for a deposition?\u201d The judge, Oltmann explained, was appointed by Jared Polis, a Democrat.",
      "Coomer is finding little comfort in the slow movement of the judicial process. He has started a new business, but he is not yet publicly disclosing what it is. He is still prone to panic attacks. In August, he was disturbed to find out that Jennifer Morrell had been receiving threats after the Gateway Pundit ran a 2018 photo of her at a barbecue at Coomer\u2019s home.",
      "For her part, Morrell says that she misses being able to consult with Coomer on election matters. Earlier this spring, Morrell says, she was struggling to understand a technicality involved in a new audit procedure for a state that hired her. She briefly thought of calling Coomer for clarification, but she realized that talking to him was no longer an option, even if he had still been working in the industry. Talking to Coomer, she worried, could leave her client vulnerable. \u201cThere\u2019s this concern \u2014 I don\u2019t want any phone record,\u201d she said. \u201cEven though everything seemed crazy and outlandish, and you knew it was false and built on lies and conspiracy \u2014 you didn\u2019t want to do anything that could jeopardize other places where you are providing support.\u201d",
      "Although Coomer\u2019s case was especially severe, most election officials she knew had been receiving, since the election, death threats or hateful messages. One colleague had photos of her children sent to her, along with threatening notes, and now had security outside her home. Following earlier mentions of her election work in the press, Morrell had received a flurry of misogynist, violent texts. A message sent to her via her company\u2019s website said that \u201cthe Caucasian founding fathers gave us a second amendment to use against the enemies of this nation ... We fully intend to exercise this amendment to rid our society of you and your ilk.\u201d",
      "Morrell says she regularly gets calls from state or local election officials who say they are losing staff. The Times recently reported that 25 percent of the directors or deputy auditors of elections in 14 counties in Ohio have left their jobs. The loss of so much institutional knowledge and expertise, the sheer shortage of workers, is another challenge facing an already frail election system.",
      "Coomer said he no longer wakes up every hour wondering if someone is outside his home. \u201cBut in some ways, it\u2019s gotten worse,\u201d he said. When the campaign against him started, he feared for his safety, but he thought the danger would be temporary. But nine months later, he had to accept that the changes to his life were permanent: \u201cNow it\u2019s almost becoming a mainstream accepted narrative that I helped rig an election.\u201d Millions of people now believed that story, and it was how history \u2014 or certain authors and readers of history \u2014 would forever remember him.",
      "If what happened in Antrim County was one case study in the power of malinformation, Coomer\u2019s is another. \u201cI think Dominion as a company would be facing all of the same things they are right now without me,\u201d Coomer said. \u201cBut I was an accelerant. And for lack of a better word, I was a perfect villain.\u201d"

      "BRUNSWICK, Ga. \u2014 It\u2019s not a stretch to say there may have never been a party for a cookbook like the one Matthew Raiford threw on his family farm a few weeks ago.",
      "The book\u2019s title is \u201cBress \u2018n\u2019 Nyam\u201d \u2014 \u201cbless and eat\u201d in the English-based Creole spoken by the Gullah Geechee people who live along the coasts of the Carolinas, Georgia and northern Florida. Their ancestors were captured in West Africa and enslaved. Nowhere else in America has the cultural line from Africa been better preserved. (Mr. Raiford\u2019s people call themselves freshwater Geechee, which means they are from the mainland of coastal Georgia. Saltwater Geechees are from the barrier islands.)",
      "Mr. Raiford\u2019s farm is on land that his great-great-great grandfather Jupiter Gilliard began buying after he was emancipated. Mr. Gillard eventually amassed 450 acres, land that Mr. Raiford believes had probably belonged to white plantation owners who either abandoned it or sold it cheap, fearing what would happen when they lost their power during Reconstruction. Over the years, the property was passed down, divided and sold. Only 42 acres remain, called Gilliard Farms.",
      "When he was 18, Mr. Raiford left the farm and vowed he would never live there again. He married and had children. He joined the Army. Eventually, he graduated from the Culinary Institute of America, in Hyde Park, N.Y. Eleven years ago, at a family reunion, his grandmother handed the deed to Mr. Raiford and his sister, Althea, and told them they needed to get back to farming.",
      "\u201cI knew it would be hard coming back,\u201d he writes in the cookbook. \u201cNot just the farming, but also as a Black man in the South who cooks in a kitchen and works the land. That\u2019s a lot of past to reckon with.\u201d",
      "For perspective, consider that the spot where Ahmaud Arbery was chased by two white men and shot to death as he jogged through a Brunswick neighborhood in 2020 is \u201call of 10 minutes from me,\u201d Mr. Raiford said. \u201cPeople are like, it\u2019s a new New South,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m like, are the people who were there when I was a kid still there? Then it\u2019s not a New South.\u201d But it\u2019s his home, and now he is dug in for good.",
      "For the book party, Mr. Raiford and his new wife, Tia LaNise Raiford, invited an eclectic group of about 30 farmers, family and friends from around the Deep South to make connections and celebrate. The couple first met at culinary school, when both were in their 20s, then reconnected recently while working on a project for the EarthDance organic farm school in Ferguson, Mo. They married in May.",
      "The two have merged their food and farming businesses into a company called Strong Roots 9, named for the $9 that Jupiter Gilliard paid in property taxes in 1870. It includes Zazou, an herbal tea company Mrs. Raiford started in Philadelphia, where she was living until she moved to the farm. She uses a lot of hibiscus, which grows well in Georgia, and has planted turmeric and ginger to harvest in the fall.",
      "Throwing a good dinner party in this corner of Georgia in high summer is no small accomplishment. The temperature hit 96 degrees as guests began to arrive. Humidity hung in the air like a blanket. There were bugs the likes of which few book-party planners have ever seen.",
      "But there were other pressing matters, like what was everyone going to eat?",
      "Mr. Raiford describes Gullah Geechee cooking as an alchemy of \u201cNative American fires, Spanish conquest, Caribbean inflection and West African ingenuity.\u201d It\u2019s also about whom you know.",
      "The Raifords got lucky. Their friends at Anchored Shrimp Company in Brunswick had just pulled in some of the last of the season\u2019s sweet, white Georgia shrimp. Mr. Raiford marinated them with rosemary from two big bushes he planted when he first came back to the farm. There were meaty rattlesnake watermelons from Calvin Waye (top, left), a family friend from down the road, and edible flowers and little cucumbers from the farmers\u2019 market to pickle. The couple picked up several pounds of stone fruit from Georgia Peach World, a charmer of a produce stand along Interstate 95. Hibiscus for tea (bottom photo, below) came from their own farm.",
      "Mr. Raiford assembled a grilling station out of cinder blocks and metro racks. Sweating it out at the grill for much of the day was the New York chef Ben Lee, who for a time ran the kitchen at A Voce Madison in Manhattan, and worked in Philadelphia for Marc Vetri, a chef Mrs. Raiford once worked for as well.",
      "Mr. Lee (below right, in cap) had long been a student of Southern cooking, but met the Raifords in Philadelphia only recently. Mr. Raiford invited him to the party. He showed up and immediately got to work. \u2018\u2018Matthew\u2019s whole model is \u2018get it done,\u2019\u201d Mr. Lee said, \u201cand that\u2019s what this farm personifies.\u201d",
      "Piles of fruit, spatchcocked chickens, eggplant and okra all got a turn over the flames. There was a big dish of Gullah red rice on the table, and for dessert, grilled peaches and plums covered in sweet teff pudding.",
      "The chickens didn\u2019t go on the grill until the guests arrived. The party stretched on for almost five hours. There was plenty of time for everyone to get to know one another. That\u2019s just how Mr. Raiford wanted it.",
      "\u201cThe book is about community,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about paying it forward and figuring out what community looks like from here.\u201d",

    "title": "Biden\u2019s Foreign Policy Priorities",
    "content": [
      "Before the Taliban marched through the gates of Kabul, before the desperate scenes of a makeshift airlift, before a baby was passed over the barbed wire on the airport walls, President Biden had one simple way of framing his decision to end the endless war in Afghanistan: national interest.",
      "\u201cThe United States cannot afford to remain tethered to policies creating a response to a world as it was 20 years ago,\u201d he said on July 8. \u201cWe need to meet the threats where they are today.\u201d",
      "It was a classic \u2014 and at the time broadly popular \u2014 bit of realpolitik. America today has a lot of important interests. To name a few: countering nuclear proliferation, standing up for human rights, combating terrorism and promoting democracy, which George W. Bush said in his second inaugural address would be the mission of the U.S. for decades to come.",
      "But as Graham T. Allison, the Harvard political scientist, often says to students, \u201cWhile all of these are important, some interests are more important than others.\u201d So it is in moments like this that we find out what a president\u2019s hierarchy of priorities is all about.",
      "And Biden has been clear about his.",
      "We have an interest in facing down the terrorist threat, the president said, but that threat is no longer centered in Afghanistan. More important, he said, is recognizing that \u201cstrategic competition with China\u201d will \u201cdetermine our future.\u201d Other threats \u2014 particularly cyberthreats \u2014 have also moved from peripheral issues to center stage.",
      "The logic is hard to argue with. The China challenge is unquestionably the most important and complex problem in American national security \u2014 part military, part technological, part economic.",
      "And the attack on Colonial Pipeline this year, which shut off a quarter of the fuel running up the East Coast, was a reminder that a well-organized cyberattack can do a lot more damage than a localized terrorism incident, even if it makes for less dramatic television.",
      "Had the withdrawal from Afghanistan gone as planned, with a relatively orderly return of the remaining 2,500 American troops and a relatively smooth handover of the defense of the country to the Afghan National Security Forces, Biden would likely be basking in praise for his Kissinger-like realism.",
      "But as they say in the military, the enemy also gets a vote. What the Taliban have done, with a brutally effective strategy that forced the collapse of the American-backed Afghan government a year or two faster than intelligence assessments thought possible, has forced Biden to defend his priorities. It is hard to get Americans to focus on a China strategy when their screens are filled with images of desperate Americans, and the thousands of Afghans who helped them over two decades, trying to get out of Afghanistan before they are hunted down.",
      "So, does Biden\u2019s argument still hold up? Yes, but with some major caveats.",
      "To rescue his focus-on-the-vital strategy, Biden knows he must first rescue those Americans and Afghan allies, whatever it takes. One of his closest aides told me last week that his legacy on Afghanistan might be decided not on how he did in the past two weeks, but on how he does in the next two. No matter how good his geopolitical strategy, if the on-the-ground execution does not improve, the withdrawal will likely be remembered as a disaster.",
      "Second, superpowers need to be able to walk and chew on their competitors at the same time. The resources needed to deal with the Afghan airlift \u2014 the one Biden on Sunday compared to the challenge of the great Berlin airlift of Cold War fame \u2014 are drastically different than the ones needed to compete with China, or to deal with cyberattacks originating from Russia.",
      "Third, the president has to deal, sooner or later, with the built-in contradictions in the Biden doctrine. He has repeatedly said that the great struggle of this century will be between the forces of democracy and the forces of autocracy. This has been a bad week for the forces of democracy and a fabulous one for autocrats, who are delighted to see America\u2019s reputation for managing the globe take a hit.",
      "Biden disagreed yesterday. History, he said, would ratify his judgment that Afghanistan was the wrong war, and that the leaders of China and Russia would \u201clove nothing better for us to continue to be bogged down there.\u201d They certainly would. But avoiding being bogged down is about more than getting out \u2014 it\u2019s about getting out in a way that enhances American leverage and stature. We\u2019re a long way from that.",

    "content": [
      "Crews battling the Caldor fire southwest of Lake Tahoe in California endured another stressful weekend as the fire grew by more than 30,000 acres in just two days.",
      "The fire, which started on Aug. 14 and grew quickly, has burned 104,000 acres and was five percent contained as of Sunday evening, according to a New York Times wildfire tracker.",
      "Nearly 350 homes have been destroyed, and more than 17,000 structures are threatened by the fire, fire officials said. At least 207 fire engines and 20 helicopters have been assisting in fighting the blaze, requiring more than 1,600 personnel so far.",
      "Thousands of people in El Dorado County had been urged to leave their homes or to prepare to do so, according to the governor\u2019s office. Officials said that evacuation orders could remain in place for up to two weeks. On Saturday, high winds caused the fire to jump Highway 50, one of the main routes between Sacramento and the Lake Tahoe area. A portion of that highway remains closed.",
      "Favorable weather may assist firefighters at the start of the week \u2014 cooler temperatures are predicted across fire-ravaged areas for Monday and Tuesday, but the same areas are forecast to reach above normal by Thursday and into Friday, the National Weather Service said. Portions of Northern California will continue to see smoke and haze from the wildfires.",
      "While wildfires occur throughout the West every year, scientists see the influence of climate change in the extreme heat waves that have contributed to the intensity of fires this summer. Prolonged periods of abnormally high temperatures are a signal of a shifting climate, they say.",
      "Across California, over 13,000 firefighters were battling 13 active large wildfires that have burned more than 1.54 million acres, according to Cal Fire, the state\u2019s firefighting agency.",
      "The Dixie fire, the second-largest on record in California, remains a threat to communities. It has burned more than 720,000 acres since it started more than a month ago. It was only 38 percent contained as of Sunday night.",
      "The fire has destroyed more than 1,200 structures, including much of the historic town of Greenville. Susanville, in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, has become a refuge for evacuees. On Sunday, some evacuation orders and warnings were reduced for some areas, particularly in Lassen County.",
      "The fire potential in most of California\u2019s mountains and foothills is forecast to be higher than normal through September, and through October in areas prone to offshore winds, the National Interagency Fire Center said this month."

      "The remnants of Tropical Storm Henri stalled over New England on Monday, dropping yet more rain and spawning three tornadoes in central Massachusetts that caused some damage but no deaths or injuries, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "All three tornadoes \u2014 the first in Marlborough at 11:40 a.m., the second in Bolton at 12:30 p.m. and the last in Stow at 1:10 p.m. \u2014 were EF-0 strength, the lowest intensity for a tornado, with peak winds at about 65 miles an hour, the National Weather Service in Boston said.",
      "Henri was downgraded to a slow-moving post-tropical cyclone on Monday evening, a day after it had knocked out power to thousands and caused flooding from New York City to Rhode Island and beyond.",
      "The storm system was located about 110 miles east-northeast of New York City at 11 p.m. on Monday, and more flooding was possible in parts of southern New England.",
      "It was moving east at 13 miles per hour with maximum sustained winds of 25 m.p.h., but the flood risk was expected to diminish by early Tuesday, according to the National Hurricane Center.",
      "Dennis Feltgen, a meteorologist at the center, said the greatest impact from the system would be more heavy rain. About five to nine inches of rain had already fallen across northern New Jersey and in the New York metro area. Central Park set a record on Saturday for the most rain in a single hour when 1.94 inches fell between 10 and 11 p.m.",
      "The storm brought as much as 8.19 inches of rain to Central Park, making this the second-wettest summer on record there, with nearly two feet of rain since June 1, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "The latest rainfall totals also included up to 9.85 inches of rain in Brooklyn and about 8.02 inches in Harrison, N.J.",
      "Henri is expected to drop an additional one to two inches of rain on Monday night and early Tuesday morning in southern and central New England.",
      "The rain could lead to flash, urban and small stream flooding, Mr. Feltgen said. Flood watches were in effect for parts of central New England.",
      "\u201cMotorists should not attempt to drive around barricades or drive through flooded areas,\u201d Mr. Feltgen said, noting that most flood deaths take place in vehicles. \u201cTurn around, don\u2019t drown,\u201d he added.",
      "Before it weakened, Henri was a tropical storm that slammed the Northeast on Sunday. The system wiped out power in most of coastal Rhode Island, forced evacuations in Connecticut, stranded dozens of motorists in New Jersey and shattered rainfall records in New York City.",
      "The system, which made landfall in Rhode Island, spared the region the brunt of what was predicted. During its peak on Sunday afternoon, the storm left more than 140,000 households without power from New Jersey to Maine."

      "The firm\u2019s disclosure came in a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Trump administration agreed to buy 110 million doses of vaccine from Novavax as part of its crash vaccine development program.",
      "Although the company reported in June that its vaccine had an efficacy of 90 percent against symptomatic Covid-19 cases, and 100 percent against severe disease, Novavax has struggled for months to mass manufacture its product. Its vaccine has not been authorized for distribution in the United States, and federal officials said it is unclear when or if it will be.",

      "In its S.E.C. filing on Thursday, Novavax said: \u201cThe U.S. government has recently instructed the company to prioritize alignment with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on the company\u2019s analytic methods before conducting additional U.S. manufacturing and further indicated that the U.S. government will not fund additional U.S. manufacturing until such agreement has been made.\u201d",
      "An official for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees Novavax\u2019s federal contract, said the government wanted the company to strengthen its testing and quality control operation. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential negotiations with the firm.",
      "Novavax said in a statement that the federal government continued to fund other work it had underway, including clinical trials. \u201cWe do not expect any impact on our funding arrangement with the U.S. government to support overall development and production of 110 million doses of our vaccine candidate,\u201d the firm said.",
      "The company\u2019s manufacturing problems come on top of production failures at a federally funded vaccine-making factory in Baltimore operated by Emergent BioSolutions.",
      "Federal regulators halted production at that plant for more than three months this year until the firm resolved quality control problems, including failure to prevent contamination that ruined tens of millions of doses.

    "title": "T. Rex Was Fearsome but May Have Been a Picky Eater",
    "content": [
      "Was the Tyrannosaurus Rex a foodie?",
      "The dinosaur, fixed in the popular imagination as a ruthless predator that chomped on whatever unfortunate creature crossed its path, actually had a jaw bristling with nerve endings that made it a more judicious eater than previously known, according to paleontologists in Japan who published their findings in Historical Biology on Monday.",
      "While it might not have been a truly discerning gastronome, the T. Rex had a sophisticated mandible comparable to the jaws of modern-day crocodiles and tactile-foraging birds, like ducks, according to the scientists from the Institute of Dinosaur Research at Fukui Prefectural University, who conducted the study.",
      "In other words, T. Rex very likely did not eat blindly, according to the study. It had keen senses that might have allowed it to recognize different parts of its prey and to chew on them differently depending on what it was munching on.",
      "\u201cThe jaws of Tyrannosaurus were powerful enough to crush bones,\u201d Soichiro Kawabe, one of the authors of the study and a paleontologist at the institute, said in an email. \u201cHowever, in situations where food was plentiful, they may have used their sensitive snouts to eat the more nutritious parts of their prey selectively. The diet of Tyrannosaurus may not have been as crude as we imagine.\u201d",
      "The study does not say how discriminating the T. Rex was or whether it could recognize the difference between bone and flesh.",
      "\u201cThese speculations are pretty imaginary and not within the scope of what we can scientifically derive from our research results,\u201d Dr. Kawabe said.",
      "The significance of the study is that it reveals the complex development of nerves within the mandible of the Tyrannosaurus, he said.",
      "\u201cBased on the morphology of the mandibular nerve of Tyrannosaurus, we were able to clarify that the jaw tip of Tyrannosaurus was most likely a pretty capable sensor,\u201d Dr. Kawabe said.",
      "Dr. Kawabe and another scientist, Soki Hattori, an assistant professor at the institute, used computed tomography, or CT scanning, to analyze and reconstruct the canal structure of the jawbone through which nerves and blood vessels would have passed. They studied the fossil of a T. Rex found in the Hell Creek Formation in Montana.",
      "The fossil was well preserved, allowing the researchers to study the canal structure, he said.",
      "The sensitive jaw tips also give clues to how the Tyrannosaurus may have parented.",
      "Crocodiles have sensitive snouts, which help them detect prey in water but also give them such a finely tuned sense of touch that they can carry their young in their mouths without crushing them with their powerful jaws.",
      "\u201cTyrannosaurus may have done the same,\u201d Dr. Kawabe said.",
      "The study underscores \u201cthe sensitive side of the T. Rex,\u201d said Jack Tseng, a paleontologist at the University of California, Berkeley, who read the report.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been really obsessed with the forces that the T. Rex could possess rather than its finesse,\u201d he said. \u201cThis gives us a sense of its finesse.\u201d",
      "The report gives \u201canother dimension\u201d to a creature that the general public has obsessed over but rarely perceived as anything more than a monster, said Dr. Tseng, who has analyzed the bite of teenage Tyrannosaurus.",
      "\u201cThey were not blockheads that were chomping down on anything they saw moving,\u201d he said.",
      "Still, Dr. Tseng said the study\u2019s findings underscore the need for more fossil evidence to show how the dinosaur\u2019s sensitive mandible was used. Analyzing coprolites, or fossilized feces, \u201ccould be another way to understand how sensitive their palate was,\u201d he said.",
      "The authors of the report acknowledged that their findings are limited: They did not analyze the full mandible area of the dinosaur or use other dinosaur fossils for comparison.",
      "\u201cIdeally, this study can be continued with a variety of additional types of dinosaurs, to see if Tyrannosaurus was truly exceptional, or just a run-of-the-mill carnivorous dinosaur,\u201d said Thomas R. Holtz, a paleontologist at the University of Maryland who read the study. \u201cBut even this smaller scale study helps us better understand dinosaurs as living, feeling animals.\u201d"

    "title": "Seeking Early Signals of Dementia in Driving and Credit Scores",
    "content": [
      "Learning your odds of eventually developing dementia \u2014 a pressing concern for many, especially those with a family history of it \u2014 requires medical testing and counseling. But what if everyday behavior, like overlooking a couple of credit card payments or habitually braking while driving, could foretell your risk?",
      "A spate of experiments is underway to explore that possibility, reflecting the growing awareness that the pathologies underlying dementia can begin years or even decades before symptoms emerge.",
      "\u201cEarly detection is key for intervention, at the stage when that would be most effective,\u201d said Sayeh Bayat, the lead author of a driving study funded by the National Institutes of Health and conducted at Washington University in St. Louis.",
      "Such efforts could help identify potential volunteers for clinical trials, researchers say, and help protect older people against financial abuse and other dangers.",
      "In recent years, many once-promising dementia drugs, particularly for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, have failed in trials. One possible reason, researchers say, is that the drugs are administered too late to be helpful. Identifying risks earlier, when the brain has sustained less damage, could create a pool of potential participants with \u201cpreclinical\u201d Alzheimer\u2019s disease, who could then test preventive measures or treatments.",
      "It could also bring improvements in daily life. \u201cWe could support people\u2019s ability to drive longer, and have safer streets for everyone,\u201d Ms. Bayat offered as an example.",
      "For now, the search for older people who are likely to develop Alzheimer\u2019s or other dementias takes place mostly in research settings, where patients learn their risk status through some combination of genetic testing, spinal taps or PET scans to detect amyloid in the brain, as well as through questions about family history.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s all about finding people soon enough to intervene and prevent or delay the onset of the disease,\u201d said Emily Largent, a medical ethicist and health policy researcher at the Penn Memory Center in Philadelphia, which undertakes many such studies.",
      "Other kinds of predictive tests are on the horizon, including over-the-counter blood tests for tau, another Alzheimer\u2019s biomarker, but are several years away, Dr. Largent said.",
      "That leaves methods that are invasive, like spinal taps, or expensive, like PET scans. These approaches can\u2019t be used to screen large groups of people. \u201cThey\u2019re not available everywhere,\u201d Ms. Bayat said. \u201cThey\u2019re not very accessible or scalable.\u201d",
      "But a GPS device in someone\u2019s car could monitor driving behavior almost continuously at low cost, providing so-called digital biomarkers. \u201cStudies have shown that driving changes in people with symptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d Ms. Bayat said. \u201cBut some changes occur even earlier.\u201d",
      "The Washington University study enrolled 64 older adults with preclinical Alzheimer\u2019s, as determined by spinal taps (the results were not shared with participants), and 75 who were deemed cognitively normal.",
      "For a year, researchers measured both groups\u2019 driving performance \u2014 how often they accelerated or braked aggressively, exceeded or fell well below the speed limit, made abrupt moves \u2014 and their \u201cdriving space\u201d (number of trips, average distance, unique destinations, trips at night). \u201cOnly now, because we have these technologies, can we do this kind of research,\u201d Ms. Bayat said.",
      "The study found that driving behavior and age could predict preclinical Alzheimer\u2019s 88 percent of the time. Those findings could spur recruitment for clinical trials and allow interventions \u2014 like an alert when a car drifts \u2014 to help keep drivers on the road. In areas with inadequate public transportation (which is most areas), that could enhance seniors\u2019 independence.",
      "Dr. Jason Karlawish, a geriatrician and co-director of the Penn Memory Center, called the study \u201cprovocative\u201d and well designed. \u201cThe results suggest that monitoring a real-world, cognitively intense behavior can detect the earliest, subtle signs of emerging cognitive impairment,\u201d he said in an email.",
      "Similarly, a study analyzing medical records and consumer credit reports for more than 80,000 Medicare beneficiaries showed that seniors who eventually received a diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease were significantly more likely to have delinquent credit card payments than those who were demographically similar but never received such diagnoses. They also were more likely to have subprime credit scores.",
      "\u201cWe were motivated by anecdotes in which family members discover a relative\u2019s dementia through a catastrophic financial event, like a home being seized,\u201d said Lauren Nicholas, the lead author and a health economist at the University of Colorado School of Public Health. \u201cThis could be a way to identify patients at risk.\u201d",
      "The problems appeared early, with at least two consecutive payments skipped as much as six years before a diagnosis, and subprime credit two and a half years before. Although smaller studies have pointed to an association between self-reported financial mismanagement and dementia, this is the largest and the first to use actual financial data, Dr. Nicholas added.",
      "In Japan, researchers have developed a machine-learning tool that scrutinizes phone conversations for signs of preclinical Alzheimer\u2019s. Using audio files recorded during interviews last year, they compared healthy patients\u2019 vocal features \u2014 pitch, intensity, silent intervals \u2014 with those with Alzheimer\u2019s and found that the models could predict cognitive status.",
      "IBM researchers have picked up elevated risk in writing tests, finding that word patterns and usage predicted later Alzheimer\u2019s diagnoses. Any of these findings might, one day, be used for early screening.",
      "Such approaches raise concerns about privacy, however. \u201cAre people comfortable with a bank or an auto insurance company having and communicating that information?\u201d Dr. Largent asked. \u201cIt becomes medical information in the hands of people who are not physicians.\u201d",
      "At the Penn Memory Center, where information is indeed in health professionals\u2019 hands, \u201csome people who are cognitively unimpaired, after testing in the clinic, indicate they\u2019d like to be monitored,\u201d she said. \u201cOthers find that unbelievably intrusive.\u201d",
      "Bioethicists have grappled for years with questions about informing patients of higher-than-normal risk for a feared disease for which there is, still, no effective treatment. Studies have shown that in research settings, results can be communicated safely and effectively. But fears of discrimination and stigma remain.",
      "Even using established biomarkers like amyloid in PET scans, these advance findings aren\u2019t definitive, which researchers take pains to point out to patients. \u201cIt\u2019s neither necessary nor sufficient to have these risk factors,\u201d Dr. Largent explained. People with elevated amyloid have higher risk but may not progress to cognitive impairment; people without it can nevertheless develop dementia.",
      "Still, Dr. Largent said, \u201cI generally think having that information can be useful to people.\u201d",
      "In a number of studies, Dr. Largent has examined what happens when dementia risks are disclosed to patients and families. She has found that about one-third of patients respond to the information by changing their health behavior, undertaking legal and financial planning or taking other preparatory steps. \u201cThey do things like update their wills, draft advance directives, exercise more, maybe move closer to an adult child,\u201d she said.",
      "Paul Gondek, 68, who lives in Philadelphia and teaches social psychology at Drexel University, chose to learn his risk status two years ago, volunteering for several studies at the Penn Memory Center. Alzheimer\u2019s tends to run in families and, having watched his mother\u2019s slow decline from the disease, he knew he had a higher chance of developing it.",
      "To Mr. Gondek\u2019s relief, the PET scan showed that he did not have elevated amounts of amyloid in his brain. And a calculated risk score showed that his odds of Alzheimer\u2019s by age 85 were about 19 percent \u2014 higher than the 11 percent risk for the general population, but lower than he had feared.",
      "If other early indicators were available through driving or financial records or other behaviors and were reliable, he said, \u201cI would want to use them. I\u2019d rather know than not.\u201d"

      "\u201cLilly went one way and her sister went the other way, and no one has seen her since,\u201d said Tarri Lynn Gillinger Holderman, Lilly\u2019s aunt. \u201cShe was washed away because the current was so strong.\u201d",

At least 21 people were confirmed dead and about 10 others remained missing, officials said, in catastrophic flash flooding that climate scientists warned will become only more common.",
      "\u201cThis is exactly the type of event we expect to see with increasing frequency in a warming climate,\u201d said Gary Lackmann, a professor of atmospheric science at North Carolina State University.",
      "The Tennessee disaster came just days after at least five people were killed in flash floods in North Carolina in the wake of Tropical Storm Fred. In July, extraordinary floods in Germany sent water crashing through the streets, killing dozens and causing widespread devastation.",
      "Some scientists caution, however, that it can be difficult to determine whether climate change is the driving force behind any individual flood or is responsible for making it more catastrophic, including in Tennessee. Flooding is a result both of heavy rainfall and of the way water is managed \u2014 through dams, levees or retention ponds \u2014 as well as a landscape\u2019s hydrology, the way that water flows, collects and runs off the land.",
      "The flooding in Tennessee struck a rural area of rivers, creeks and rolling woods in and around Humphreys County, about 90 minutes west of Nashville. Up to 17 inches of rain fell on Saturday, shattering the state\u2019s 24-hour record by more than 3 inches.",
      "\u201cOur people need help,\u201d Chris Davis, the Humphreys County sheriff, said at a news briefing. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be overwhelmed for the next 30 days at least. Overwhelmed.\u201d",
      "One reason the flood was so deadly is that such smaller-scale storms can be trickier to forecast than large weather systems like hurricanes, which are tracked in part by radar and satellite data. Any heavy rainfall, which produces heat, can cause the forecasting models to perform poorly.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s sort of a worst-case scenario because it\u2019s a small weather system that happens and develops quickly,\u201d Dr. Lackmann said. \u201cFor these kinds of events, it\u2019s going to be really difficult to get much lead time or forecast warning.\u201d",
      "And attribution studies \u2014 a type of research that aims to establish links between climate change and specific extreme weather events \u2014 can take time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to attribute a single weather event to climate change,\u201d Dr. Lackmann said. But, he added, \u201cwhen you start seeing these events happening more frequently, it becomes more unambiguous.\u201d",
      "In Waverly, the epicenter of the destruction, anguish rippled through the closely knit community of about 4,100 people.",
      "Terri Owen recalled standing on her toes amid the storm on Saturday, struggling to keep her head above the rising water. She could see the woman across the street clinging to a pillar on her front porch, her cries for help punctuated by piercing screams. Two days later, the woman\u2019s voice was still in her head.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t help you!\u201d Ms. Owen remembered shouting back.",
      "The water was furious. Stoves, refrigerators and cars whipped by. The pillar came loose, Ms. Owen said, and the screaming intensified. The entire house was swooped off its moorings and carried down the block. The woman died, and so did her adult son.",
      "\u201cGod had no more favor on me than the woman who lost her life,\u201d Ms. Owen said, pulling down her sunglasses to wipe her eyes as she sat on her friend\u2019s muddy front porch. \u201cI was just in a different place.\u201d",
      "Many were straining on Monday to grasp all that had been lost. School has been canceled for at least a week, officials said, and many roads and bridges remained closed to traffic.",
      "The devastation could be seen for about 10 miles, Sheriff Davis said.",
      "Homes were not just flooded but torn from their foundations and obliterated. Cars were tossed across roads. The hospital, already busy with Covid-19 patients, is now caring for those injured in the storm, according to Chief Grant Gillespie of the Waverly Department of Public Safety.",
      "When Ryan Amell\u2019s wife posted his phone number on Facebook on Saturday and said he was setting out on the water to rescue people in his small aluminum duck-hunting boat, he was immediately messaged by dozens in desperation.",
      "A mother sent him a photo of herself in chest-deep water, her child on the kitchen countertop trying to avoid the rising stream. He got texts from people asking him to save their older loved ones who could not swim. There were so many calls that his phone shut down and froze, but not before he answered one from a boy who, through tears, asked if he could please save his disabled grandmother.",
      "He would rescue six people, but he still finds it difficult to sleep at night.",
      "\u201cI should\u2019ve tried harder,\u201d Mr. Amell, 31, said. \u201cI keep replaying it in my head.\u201d",
      "The number of victims and potential victims fluctuated as new names were added to the list of people missing and others were reported safe by family members, officials said. Early Monday morning, the list of missing people was up to 40; by afternoon, it had been reduced to about 10, according to Chief Gillespie.",
      "Officials said the search teams, which descended on Humphreys County from across Tennessee, were pushing forward with urgency to find those whose whereabouts remained unknown, fearful of the death toll growing as time passes. Chief Gillespie told reporters that crews were employing heavy equipment to chew through mountains of debris where they feared that people might still be trapped.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a painstaking process,\u201d he said.",
      "Beyond the human toll, the physical devastation has been nearly impossible to comprehend. Entire neighborhoods were shredded. Some homes that were still intact were filled with mud and the rancid stench the water left behind.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m 61 years old,\u201d said Amanda Capps, whose home was swamped. \u201cThere\u2019s a lifetime of memories just gone.\u201d Mementos handed down from her great-grandparents and grandparents were either lost in the water or caked in mud.",
      "Many residents were quick to express their gratitude, even after being gutted by loss. As Annetta Sykes sat on her front porch on a sweltering afternoon, volunteers hauled her mud-specked refrigerator down her steps and threw it in on a growing pile of furniture, appliances and carpets. Strangers passing through the neighborhood brought her water and helped to clear out her house. She was grateful for them. She was also grateful to God.",
      "\u201cYou know by God\u2019s grace you\u2019re going to come out on the other side,\u201d she said.",
      "There was no question that rebuilding the community would be daunting, but there was also a looming concern about whether people would want to return. Many said they could not bear to face such trauma again.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to worry when it starts raining if there\u2019s going to be a flood,\u201d said Ms. Sykes, who wonders if she should remain in the house where she has lived for 17 years.",
      "\u201cI will never be in this city again when it rains,\u201d Ms. Owen said. \u201cNobody who wasn\u2019t in it can ever understand it.\u201d"

      "In fact, long before the pandemic, many students with disabilities had been calling for such accommodations, often to little avail. The past year, however, has made remote instruction seem more feasible. While some colleges have resisted remote learning as an accommodation, others say they are considering it.",
      "\u201cThe argument in the past, pre-Covid, was, \u2018Of course, an online course is fundamentally different than a course in the classroom,\u2019\u201d said Arlene Kanter, an expert in disability law at the Syracuse University College of Law. \u201cWell, Covid changed all that.\u201d",
      "Colleges and universities are generally required to provide \u201creasonable\u201d accommodations or modifications for qualified students with disabilities \u2014 as long as those changes do not \u201cfundamentally alter\u201d the nature of the program or pose other undue burdens for the institutions.",
      "Those terms have always been open to interpretation and debate. But because many colleges did not offer discounts on tuition for remote learning last year, they could have a harder time arguing that it is fundamentally different from, or inferior to, in-person instruction.",
      "\u201cIt becomes maybe a little tricky for school officials to then later claim that going online would be a serious degradation of the educational environment,\u201d said Adam M. Samaha, an expert in constitutional and disability law at New York University\u2019s School of Law. \u201cIf that is good-enough education, then a student might claim, \u2018Why not extend the same principle to a person who has physical difficulty commuting to the classroom?\u2019\u201d",
      "Cameron Lynch believes colleges weren\u2019t built with students like her in mind. To get to class at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Va., Ms. Lynch, a rising sophomore with muscular dystrophy, said she had to navigate uneven brick walkways. And some of the campus\u2019s old buildings lack accessibility features like elevators or ramps.",
      "\u201cWalking to class is always kind of difficult, regardless of Covid, so it\u2019s nice to be online,\u201d Ms. Lynch said.",
      "Ms. Lynch, who also has celiac disease and diabetes, is immunocompromised. And even though she is vaccinated, she is fearful of getting the coronavirus and has lived much of the past year in isolation.",
      "Last year, when her college started offering classes in person again, she discovered that some of the classes she needed to take for her double major in sociology and government were no longer being offered online. She brought her concerns to the college\u2019s disability services office. It declined to allow her to attend her required classes remotely.",
      "\u201cThey kind of just told me to take an extra semester,\u201d Ms. Lynch said.",
      "Ms. Lynch, who took online courses over the summer to catch up, said she was \u201cstressed out\u201d about the fall semester and unsure whether she would be able to take all the classes she needed online.",
      "Suzanne Clavet, a spokeswoman for William & Mary, declined to comment on Ms. Lynch\u2019s case and said the college considered online learning as a possible accommodation on a case-by-case basis. In an email, she said, \u201cIn some instances, remote courses are not possible if this would result in a fundamental alteration of the course.\u201d",
      "Remote accommodations appeal to some faculty members, too. Cornell University faced pushback from faculty members when it announced that it would \u201cnot approve requests\u201d for remote teaching, for reasons including disability accommodations.",
      "Two days later, the university said that \u201cshort-term or partial remote instruction\u201d could be considered for those unable to study or teach in person this fall. But \u201cnot a lot of classes\u201d would be considered eligible for remote instruction, even if they were taught remotely last year, said Michael I. Kotlikoff, Cornell\u2019s provost.",
      "Ms. Lynch said that in Chronic and Iconic, an informal online support group that she founded for immunocompromised college students, students could \u201crant with people who get it\u201d when they might otherwise feel isolated and unsupported on campus.",
      "Students don\u2019t have much recourse. \u201cI can\u2019t sue because it\u2019s too expensive, and I didn\u2019t want to cause any problems in my school,\u201d Ms. Lynch said.",
      "Even just knowing that online classes are an option can help students with disabilities by assuring them that there is a safety net.",
      "Last semester, Sophia Martino, a senior at the University of Missouri who has spinal muscular atrophy and uses a wheelchair, chose to attend two lab-based classes in person. In May, she got sick with Covid-19, despite being vaccinated.",
      "Even after that hard year, she plans to take classes in person this fall. But knowing that the university has already given a handful of students permission to attend classes remotely this year, she said, makes her feel better about attending in-person classes, because there are accommodations if she needs them.",
      "\u201cThe idea of remote instruction as an accommodation is something that\u2019s newer from the pandemic,\u201d said Ashley Brickley, director of the university\u2019s disability center.",
      "Indeed, online classes are not a panacea, as Cory Lewis, a biology major at Georgia Military College, discovered last year. Mr. Lewis has sickle cell disease, which can cause fatigue, chronic pain and organ damage and leaves him especially vulnerable to infectious diseases. He was hospitalized four times last year, including once for kidney failure, and spent months with lingering pain.",
      "If it had been a normal academic year, he might have had to withdraw from classes, he said. Instead, he was able to stay enrolled. An enterprising biology professor even mailed out at-home lab kits, packed with all the supplies he needed to conduct a variety of hands-on experiments.",
      "But Mr. Lewis struggled to focus in his other remote classes, and his grades slipped, he said. So he plans to return to in-person learning this fall, even though he worries about his health.",
      "\u201cI just learn a lot better when I\u2019m actually in front of the teacher,\u201d said Mr. Lewis, who is fully vaccinated but said that some of his classmates were not. \u201cBut knowing that my health could be at risk, especially with the Delta variant, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen with school now.\u201d",
      "He is grateful that he had the flexibility of remote learning. Ms. Martino, for her part, would like to have the option to attend remotely long after the pandemic ends \u2014 perhaps on days when her muscles ache and it\u2019s hard to get out of bed, or when the weather is bad and it is difficult to get to class in her wheelchair.",
      "\u201cMaybe in the future they would think about having them hold like a hybrid class where if you needed to attend online, that\u2019d be nice,\u201d she said."

    "content": [
      "PASADENA \u2014 Along bustling Colorado Boulevard, friends clinked wine glasses in the glow of twinkle lights. A few blocks away, another group of diners ate beside massive potted plants as a crooner serenaded them from onstage.",
      "It was a typical summer evening in Southern California, except that the restaurant-goers were sitting in what was, just months ago, a busy lane of traffic.",
      "Pasadena, a city of approximately 141,000 in Los Angeles County, narrowed roads last summer to allow for more outdoor seating, a move popular among customers and businesses alike.",
      "\u201cOK, so people are going to sit in the middle of the street?\u201d Jack Huang, a local restaurant owner, recalled wondering when the idea was first proposed. \u201cI guess they are.\u201d",
      "The success of outdoor dining expansions, as well as slow streets programs that made roads safer for pedestrians, has helped chipped away at a long-held tenet of life in L.A.: deference to cars.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of attitude to use spaces differently than we had in the past,\u201d Madeline Brozen, an urban planning expert at U.C.L.A., told me. \u201cI think there\u2019s interest in trying to reclaim some of the spaces that had been set aside for cars only.\u201d",
      "Over the past 18 months, initiatives giving pedestrians the right of way have cropped up across the country. San Francisco prohibited cars on the boulevard that cuts through Golden Gate Park so cyclists and walkers could roam freely. New York closed 83 miles of streets to automobiles for more walking, cycling and outdoor dining.",
      "But there are few places where cars are as dominant a force as in Southern California.",
      "Brozen told me that before the pandemic, L.A. restaurant owners with limited outdoor space would generally reserve it for parking spots for customers.",
      "But that calculus changed when outdoor dining was deemed safer than indoor for limiting the spread of the coronavirus. And the resulting expansion of outdoor seating revealed pent-up demand, she said.",
      "\u201cL.A. has historically just done a very poor job of having outdoor dining,\u201d Brozen told me. \u201cBut people want to be outside. That\u2019s a big reason why people live in Los Angeles \u2014 the great weather.\u201d",
      "The outdoor dining programs aren\u2019t perfect, she pointed out. For example, putting tables outside can block parts of the sidewalk and make it harder for people on foot.",
      "But these programs showed Angelenos what they may have needed to see to believe, Brozen said: that when you took away some space from cars, \u201cthe world didn\u2019t come to an end.\u201d",
      "Brigham Yen, a real estate agent and pedestrian advocate in L.A., said he believed that outdoor dining programs also made streets appear more inviting, so people may be more motivated to move around on foot.",
      "As Yen and I strolled through Old Town Pasadena, the city\u2019s commercial center, he pointed to restaurant patrons drinking pints of beer on patios and others talking over plates of pasta.",
      "\u201cPeople see people outside, and it activates the street,\u201d Yen told me. \u201cWhen you see a whole bunch of people outside, people get excited: \u2018Wow, what\u2019s going on? This is a happening place.\u2019\u201d",
      "Indeed, when we turned onto a block without outdoor dining, the street felt sterile by comparison \u2014 no music or din of conversation. There were people, but they sat behind tinted glass windows.",
      "Lisa Derderian, Pasadena city spokeswoman, told me that the outdoor dining program, which has been vital to helping restaurants survive the pandemic, had been extended through the first quarter of 2022.",
      "She said that the reduction in car lanes had affected traffic, but that she thought there would have been more pushback if had happened at any time other than the pandemic.",
      "\u201cPeople now are getting used to that and working around it,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe\u2019re getting great reviews.\u201d",
      "In a major victory for tech companies, Californians last year passed Proposition 22, which classified gig workers, such as Uber and Lyft drivers, as independent contractors, instead of full-time employees eligible for health care, unemployment insurance and other benefits.",
      "But on Friday, a California Superior Court judge ruled that the law was unconstitutional and unenforceable, my colleague Kate Conger reports.",
      "Though the decision is not likely to immediately affect the new law, it has reopened the debate about whether such workers deserve full benefits.",
      "This chocolate banana pudding is best the day it\u2019s made, but can last for up to 24 hours \u2014 if you can wait that long to eat it.",
